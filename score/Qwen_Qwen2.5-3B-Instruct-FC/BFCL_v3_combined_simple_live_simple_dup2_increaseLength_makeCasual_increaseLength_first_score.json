The resonant frequency is the frequency at which the inductive and capacitive reactances in the circuit are equal in magnitude but opposite in phase, causing them to cancel each other out. This results in a purely resistive impedance, allowing maximum current flow through the circuit.\n\nThe LC circuit, comprising an inductor (L) and a capacitor (C), resonates at a specific frequency determined by the values of these components.

It achieves this by performing two key operations: normalization of numerical values and encoding of categorical variables.\n\nFirstly, the function normalizes the numerical values present in the dataset. Normalization is the process of scaling individual samples to have unit norm, or to fit within a specific range, often 0 to 1, or -1 to 1.

Categorical variables are those that represent discrete categories or labels, and they must be transformed into a numerical format that can be interpreted by machine learning algorithms. This transformation can take the form of label encoding, which assigns each category a unique numerical label, or one-hot encoding, which creates binary columns for each category, allowing algorithms to understand categorical data without assuming any ordinal relationship between categories.\n\nBy performing these preprocessing steps, the function ensures that the input data is in a consistent and machine-readable format. This is crucial for the effective training and evaluation of machine learning models, as it prevents issues related to disparate scales or misinterpretation of categorical data. \n\nAn example of usage would involve passing a raw dataset to this function, which would then return a preprocessed version of the data, ready for input into a machine learning model.

This structured approach facilitates easy retrieval and analysis of queries based on their intent.\n\nParameters:\n- The function accepts multiple keyword arguments, where each keyword corresponds to an intent name, and the associated value is a list of queries belonging to that intent.\n\nFor example, consider the following function call:\n```python\nrecord_queries(support_queries=[\"How can I reset my password?\", \"What is the refund policy?\"], \n               sales_queries=[\"Do you offer discounts?\", \"Can I get a quote?\"])\n```\nIn this example, two keyword arguments are passed: `support_queries` and `sales_queries`. The `support_queries` keyword argument contains a list of queries related to customer support, while the `sales_queries` keyword argument includes queries pertaining to sales inquiries. The function will categorize these queries into their respective categories, \"support\" and \"sales,\" based on the provided keyword arguments.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- If no keyword arguments are provided, the function will not perform any categorization, as there are no queries to process.\n- If a keyword argument is provided with an empty list, the function will recognize the intent but will not have any queries to record under that category.\n\nThis approach ensures that all specified queries are categorized systematically, supporting streamlined data management and further processing based on intent.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": [], "properties": {"faq_auto_withdraw_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries about setting up or understanding automatic withdrawals, including benefits and signup instructions.", "default": []}, "payment_information_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries regarding balance checks, due dates for credit cards or other financial accounts.", "default": []}, "pma_income_requirements_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries concerning the income requirements for obtaining mortgages or loans.", "default": []}, "outofscope": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries that do not fit into any other specified intent categories.", "default": []}}}}, {"name": "record2", "description": "Records all specified queries into their corresponding categories based on intent names provided as keyword arguments.This function helps you keep track of different queries by sorting them into specific categories.

This function plays a crucial role for investors seeking to forecast their potential earnings from a mutual fund over a specific time frame.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n1. **Yearly Yield**: This parameter represents the annual percentage increase in the value of the mutual fund. It is typically expressed as a decimal fraction (e.g., a 5% yield would be expressed as 0.05). The yearly yield is a critical factor as it determines how much the investment is expected to grow each year.\n\n2. **Investment Amount**: This is the initial amount of money invested in the mutual fund. The investment amount is the principal sum on which the returns are calculated. A higher initial investment generally results in higher total returns, assuming the yield remains constant.\n\n3. **Time Period**: This parameter specifies the duration for which the investment will be held, typically measured in years. The time period is fundamental in compounding calculations, as it determines how many times the yield is applied to the investment.\n\n**Functionality and Edge Cases:**\n\nThe function calculates the estimated return by applying the compound interest formula, which considers the effect of the yearly yield over the specified time period. It assumes that the yield is compounded annually, and the returns are reinvested at the same rate. \n\nIn scenarios where the time period is zero, the function should return the initial investment amount, as no time has passed for the yield to be applied. Similarly, if the yearly yield is zero, the return will simply equal the initial investment amount, because no growth occurs without yield, regardless of the time period.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```python\n# Example: Estimating the return on a mutual fund investment\nyearly_yield = 0.07  # 7% annual yield\ninvestment_amount =", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"yearly_yield": {"type": "float", "description": "The yearly yield of the mutual fund as a percentage."}, "investment_amount": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial investment amount in the mutual fund."}, "years": {"type": "integer", "description": "The time period for which the investment is made in years."}}, "required": ["yearly_yield", "investment_amount", "years"]}}, {"name": "estimate_mutual_fund_return2", "description": "Calculate the estimated return on a mutual fund given the yearly yield, the investment amount and the time period.Want to figure out how much money you might make from a mutual fund?

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.This function is designed to execute system-level commands specifically on Windows operating systems by utilizing the `os.system()` function from the Python standard library. The `os.system()` function is a simple way to run a command as if it were being typed directly into the command prompt. It is important to note that this function only works effectively on Windows, and its behavior might differ if used on other operating systems.\n\nThe function can handle both single commands and multiple commands that are chained together using the logical AND operator '&&'.

Each command string is processed by the command-line interpreter, and the output will be displayed in the console.\n\nIt's important to handle errors appropriately when using `os.system()`, as it will return the exit status of the command. An exit status of zero indicates success, while any non-zero value indicates an error occurred.

The calculation is contingent upon three primary factors: the distance traveled by the vehicle over the course of a year, the type of fuel used by the vehicle, and the vehicle's fuel efficiency. \n\n- **Distance Traveled**: This parameter represents the total mileage or kilometers that the vehicle covers in a year. Accurate data on the annual distance traveled is crucial, as it directly impacts the emissions calculation. \n\n- **Fuel Type**: Different fuel types have varying carbon emissions per unit used. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, and natural gas, among others. Each type has a specific carbon emission factor, which is used to determine the amount of CO2 produced per unit of fuel consumed. For example, diesel generally emits more CO2 per gallon than gasoline.\n\n- **Fuel Efficiency**: This parameter measures the vehicle's efficiency in terms of fuel consumption, typically expressed in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). A higher fuel efficiency indicates that less fuel is required to cover the same distance, thereby potentially reducing the overall carbon emissions.\n\nThe function integrates these parameters to provide an estimate of the annual CO2 emissions. It is essential for the user to input accurate and realistic data for each parameter to ensure the calculation's reliability. This function can be particularly useful for vehicle owners, environmental analysts, and policymakers aiming to assess and mitigate the carbon footprint of automotive transportation.\n\nFor example, if a vehicle travels 12,000 miles in a year, uses gasoline as fuel, and has a fuel efficiency of 25 MPG, the function will use these inputs to compute the total CO2 emissions for the year.

It achieves this by considering several key musical elements that influence the overall sound and structure of the melody.\n\nParameters that typically influence the melody generation might include:\n\n1. **Key Signature**: Determines the scale in which the melody will be composed. For example, a melody in C Major will sound different from one in A Minor due to the different set of notes emphasized in each scale.\n   \n2. **Tempo**: This refers to the speed or pace of the melody, usually measured in beats per minute (BPM). A higher tempo results in a faster piece of music, while a lower tempo creates a slower melody.\n\n3. **Rhythm**: Defines the pattern of beats in the melody, including note durations and the timing between notes. This can range from simple, repetitive patterns to complex and varied rhythms.\n\n4. **Melodic Range**: Sets the highest and lowest pitches that the melody can reach. This can influence the emotional impact of the melody, with wider ranges often being more dramatic.\n\n5. **Note Density**: Controls how many notes appear within a given segment of the melody. A higher density can create a more intricate and busy sound, while a lower density can make the melody feel more relaxed and spacious.\n\nBy adjusting these parameters, the `generateMelody` function can produce a wide variety of musical lines that can serve different purposes, from part of a larger composition to a standalone musical piece.

The progression will consist of a predetermined number of chords. Chord progressions are fundamental to the structure of music, providing the harmonic foundation upon which melodies and rhythms are built. By specifying both the key and the number of chords, users can tailor the progression to fit the mood and style they are aiming to achieve in their composition.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n- **Key**: This parameter determines the tonal center of the chord progression. It specifies the scale from which the chords will be derived. The key can be any of the 12 major or minor keys commonly used in Western music. For example, choosing a key of C major means that the generated chords will be based on the C major scale, which includes the notes C, D, E, F, G, A, and B.\n\n- **Number of Chords**: This parameter defines how many chords will make up the progression. The number can vary depending on the desired complexity and length of the musical piece. For instance, a simple chord progression might consist of four chords, which is a typical structure used in many pop and rock songs. More elaborate compositions might utilize eight or more chords to create intricate harmonic progressions.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\nSuppose you want to create a simple four-chord progression in the key of G major. You would call the function with \"G major\" as the key and \"4\" as the number of chords. The function would then output a progression using chords from the G major scale, such as G, C, D, and Em.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n\n- **Key not specified**: If the key is not specified, the function might default to a common key such as C major, which is often used since it contains no sharps or flats, making it straightforward for beginners.\n\n- **Number of", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"key": {"type": "string", "description": "The key for the chord progression."}, "chords": {"type": "integer", "description": "Number of chords in the progression."}, "progression_type": {"type": "string", "description": "The type of the chord progression.

In the classic game of blackjack, the goal is for players to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. The function operates by comparing the total value of each player's hand, including the dealer's, according to the rules of blackjack.\n\nThe function first assesses whether any player has a hand total of exactly 21, known as a \"blackjack,\" which is the optimal hand. If a player achieves this with their initial hand of two cards, they are declared the winner unless the dealer also has a blackjack, which would result in a tie, known as a \"push.\"\n\nIf no player has a blackjack, the function then checks for any hands that exceed 21, which is called a \"bust.\" Any player or the dealer with a hand total over 21 automatically loses, regardless of other hands.\n\nNext, the function compares the remaining valid hands (those 21 or under) to determine the highest value. The player with the highest valid hand total, closer to 21 than any other, is declared the winner, as long as their hand is higher than the dealer's. If the dealer's hand is higher, the dealer wins. If there is a tie between the player and the dealer's hands, the outcome is a push.\n\nThe function should account for multiple players, checking each player's hand against the dealer's in sequence, and declare winners accordingly. It assumes all hands are valid and properly formatted according to the rules of blackjack, and it should handle ties and busts appropriately to ensure accurate results.\n\nUsage Example:\nAssume the function is called `determineBlackjackWinner`, and it takes an array of player hands and a dealer hand as inputs.

It serves as a valuable tool for applications that require time zone awareness or for users who need to stay informed about the time in different geographical locations for business or personal reasons. \n\n#### How It Works\n\nThe function takes a city name as an input parameter and returns the current time in that city. It achieves this by accessing a comprehensive database of time zones, which correlates city names with their respective time zones. The function ensures accuracy by considering any factors that might affect the local time, such as daylight saving time adjustments.\n\n#### Usage\n\n- **Input Parameter**: The function requires a single argument, which is the name of the city for which the current time is desired. The city name should be provided as a string. It is important to ensure that the city name is correctly spelled and is recognized by the function's underlying database.\n  \n- **Output**: The output of the function is the current local time for the specified city, typically returned in a standard time format (e.g., HH:MM:SS). The exact format may vary depending on the implementation but generally includes hours, minutes, and seconds.\n\n#### Edge Cases and Considerations\n\n- **Case Sensitivity**: The city name input may be case-sensitive, depending on the implementation. It is advisable to standardize the input to a consistent case (such as all lowercase) to avoid mismatches.\n\n- **Ambiguities**: In cases where multiple cities share the same name (e.g., Springfield in the United States), additional information such as the country or state may be required to disambiguate the request.\n\n- **Non-standard City Names**: If a city is not included in the time zone database, or if an incorrect city name is provided, the function may return an error or a null value.
