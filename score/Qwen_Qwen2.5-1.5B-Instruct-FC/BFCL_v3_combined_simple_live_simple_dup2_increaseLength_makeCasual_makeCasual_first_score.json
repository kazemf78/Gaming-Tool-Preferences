If optional 'root_type' is 'real', the function will only return real roots. If not specified, function may return complex roots.The function is designed to solve a quadratic equation, which is a polynomial equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where 'a', 'b', and 'c' are known coefficients. The function takes these coefficients as input parameters, allowing it to calculate the roots of the equation. Typically, the roots of a quadratic equation are obtained using the quadratic formula: x = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a. \n\nThe function also provides optional functionality to specify the type of roots returned through the 'root_type' parameter. By default, or if 'root_type' is unspecified, the function will compute both real and complex roots, depending on the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac). When the discriminant is positive, the roots are real and distinct. If the discriminant is zero, the roots are real and equal. However, if the discriminant is negative, the function will return complex roots, which include imaginary numbers.\n\nWhen the 'root_type' parameter is explicitly set to 'real', the function is constrained to return only real roots. In this case, if the discriminant is negative, the function might return an indication that there are no real roots, as complex solutions involve imaginary numbers and are thus not considered 'real'.\n\nFor practical usage, users can call the function by providing the coefficients 'a', 'b', and 'c' as arguments. If they wish to ensure only real roots are returned, they should also supply 'root_type' with the value 'real'. This is particularly useful in applications where complex numbers are not acceptable or meaningful. \n\nExample usage:\n- solve_quadratic(a=1, b=5, c=6) might return roots [-2, -3] if complex roots are acceptable, or [-2, -3] if only real roots are specified since the discriminant is positive.\n- solve_quadratic(a=1, b=2", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"a": {"type": "integer", "description": "The coefficient of the squared term in the quadratic equation."}, "b": {"type": "integer", "description": "The coefficient of the linear term in the quadratic equation."}, "c": {"type": "integer", "description": "The constant term in the quadratic equation."}, "root_type": {"type": "string", "description": "The type of roots to return: 'real' for real roots, 'all' for both real and complex roots.

This interval is determined by two boundary points, typically denoted as 'a' and 'b', where 'a' is the starting point and 'b' is the ending point. The mathematical function, which can be of any form such as linear, polynomial, exponential, etc., should be continuous over the interval to ensure accurate calculation. \n\nThe primary method employed for this purpose is numerical integration, which involves approximating the area by dividing the interval into small subintervals. In each subinterval, the function value is evaluated, and these values are used to estimate the area under the curve by summing the contributions from each subinterval. Common techniques for numerical integration include the trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule, or more advanced methods like Gaussian quadrature, depending on the required precision and complexity of the function.\n\nEdge cases to consider include scenarios where the function exhibits discontinuities or singularities within the interval, as these can affect the accuracy of the integration. Additionally, if the interval is very large or the function varies rapidly, a higher number of subintervals may be required to achieve a desired level of precision.\n\nHere is a conceptual usage example: Suppose you have a function \\( f(x) = x^2 \\) and you are interested in calculating the area under this curve from \\( x = 1 \\) to \\( x = 3 \\).

This prediction is based on known correlations between body mass index (BMI), which is calculated using weight and height, and the risk of type 2 diabetes. \n\n### Parameters:\n- **Weight (in kilograms)**: This parameter represents the individual's body weight. Accurate and recent weight information is crucial for precise prediction since weight directly affects the BMI calculation.\n- **Height (in meters)**: This parameter indicates the person's height. Like weight, accurate height data is essential as it is used in combination with the weight to compute the BMI.\n\n### Functionality:\nThe function first calculates the individual's BMI using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{BMI} = \\frac{\\text{Weight (kg)}}{\\text{Height (m)}^2} \\]\n\nOnce the BMI is computed, the function maps this value to a risk level based on medically established BMI categories that correlate with the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes. Higher BMI values generally indicate a higher risk, though this function focuses on statistical likelihoods rather than guaranteed outcomes.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- **Extremely Low or High BMI Values**: The function should handle extraordinarily low or high BMI values gracefully, ensuring that predictions reflect genuine medical research on the likelihood of diabetes risk within these ranges.\n- **Invalid Input Values**: The function assumes input values are within a plausible range for human weight and height. However, it should incorporate checks or error handling for non-numeric or implausible inputs (e.g., negative values or zero).\n\n### Usage Example:\nTo use this function, you would input an individual's weight and height as follows:\n\n```python\nrisk = predict_diabetes_likelihood(weight=70, height=1.75)\n```\n\nThis example would calculate the BMI for a person weighing 70 kilograms and standing 1.75 meters tall, subsequently returning a prediction of their likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes based", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"weight": {"type": "integer", "description": "Weight of the person in lbs."}, "height": {"type": "integer", "description": "Height of the person in inches."}, "activity_level": {"type": "string", "enum": ["sedentary", "lightly active", "moderately active", "very active", "extra active"], "description": "Physical activity level of the person."}}, "required": ["weight", "height", "activity_level"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"diabetes_prediction1": {"weight": 150, "height": 65, "activity_level": "lightly active"}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"diabetes_prediction1": {"weight": 150, "height": 65, "activity_level": "lightly active"}}], "possible_answer": [{"diabetes_prediction1": {"weight": [150], "height": [70], "activity_level": ["lightly active"]}}, {"diabetes_prediction2": {"weight": [150], "height": [70], "activity_level": ["lightly active"]}}, {"diabetes_prediction3": {"weight": [150], "height": [70], "activity_level": ["lightly active"]}}]}

The sine wave is a smooth, periodic oscillation that is fundamental in various fields such as physics, engineering, and signal processing. To use this function effectively, the user must provide two key parameters: the frequency of the sine wave and the range of x-values over which the wave will be plotted.\n\nThe frequency parameter dictates how many complete cycles of the sine wave occur within a unit interval. A higher frequency results in more oscillations appearing in the same interval, while a lower frequency results in fewer oscillations. It is typically expressed in hertz (Hz), which measures the number of cycles per second.\n\nThe range parameter specifies the domain of x-values over which the sine wave is to be plotted. This range is usually defined by a starting point and an ending point, and it determines the length of the x-axis in the plot. The range can be expressed as a tuple or a list, such as (start, end), and should be chosen to effectively capture the details of the sine wave, especially when dealing with high frequencies.\n\nFor instance, if the frequency is set to 1 Hz and the range is specified as 0 to 2\u03c0, the function will plot one complete cycle of the sine wave. On the other hand, setting the frequency to 2 Hz with the same range will result in two complete cycles being displayed within the interval.\n\nUsers should ensure that the range is selected so that it is long enough to adequately visualize the wave, especially for lower frequencies, where the wave's behavior might not be apparent over a short interval.\n\nUsage Example:\n```python\nplot_sine_wave(frequency=5, range=(0, 2*np.pi))\n```\nThis example will generate a plot of a sine wave with a frequency of 5 Hz over the interval from 0 to 2\u03c0 radians, resulting in five complete cycles displayed", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"start_range": {"type": "float", "description": "Start of the range in radians.

This methodology combines multiple decision trees to form a robust model that improves accuracy and reduces the risk of overfitting compared to a single decision tree. \n\n### Functionality\n- **Data Input**: The function requires a dataset as input, typically structured in a tabular form where each row represents an individual data instance and each column corresponds to a feature or attribute. The dataset should include both the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target) that the model aims to predict.\n  \n- **Model Training**: Once the data is provided, the function will initiate the process of training the Random Forest model. This involves generating multiple decision trees, each trained on a random subset of the data. The randomness in feature selection and data sampling ensures that the ensemble of trees captures various patterns within the data.\n\n- **Hyperparameters**: During the training phase, various hyperparameters can be set to tune the model's performance. These can include the number of trees in the forest, the maximum depth of each tree, the minimum number of samples required to split a node, and others. Appropriate selection of these hyperparameters is crucial for optimizing the model's predictive power.\n\n- **Output**: After the training process is complete, the function outputs a trained Random Forest model. This model can be used for making predictions on new data, where it aggregates the predictions from all individual trees to provide a final output, typically employing majority voting for classification tasks or averaging for regression tasks.\n\n### Edge Cases\n- The function assumes that the input data is clean and preprocessed, with no missing values or categorical features that haven't been encoded. If the dataset contains such issues, it may lead to errors or suboptimal performance.\n- The function's performance may vary based on the size and quality of the dataset.

This function plays a crucial role for investors seeking to forecast their potential earnings from a mutual fund over a specific time frame.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n1. **Yearly Yield**: This parameter represents the annual percentage increase in the value of the mutual fund. It is typically expressed as a decimal fraction (e.g., a 5% yield would be expressed as 0.05). The yearly yield is a critical factor as it determines how much the investment is expected to grow each year.\n\n2. **Investment Amount**: This is the initial amount of money invested in the mutual fund. The investment amount is the principal sum on which the returns are calculated. A higher initial investment generally results in higher total returns, assuming the yield remains constant.\n\n3. **Time Period**: This parameter specifies the duration for which the investment will be held, typically measured in years. The time period is fundamental in compounding calculations, as it determines how many times the yield is applied to the investment.\n\n**Functionality and Edge Cases:**\n\nThe function calculates the estimated return by applying the compound interest formula, which considers the effect of the yearly yield over the specified time period. It assumes that the yield is compounded annually, and the returns are reinvested at the same rate. \n\nIn scenarios where the time period is zero, the function should return the initial investment amount, as no time has passed for the yield to be applied. Similarly, if the yearly yield is zero, the return will simply equal the initial investment amount, because no growth occurs without yield, regardless of the time period.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```python\n# Example: Estimating the return on a mutual fund investment\nyearly_yield = 0.07  # 7% annual yield\ninvestment_amount =", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"yearly_yield": {"type": "float", "description": "The yearly yield of the mutual fund as a percentage."}, "investment_amount": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial investment amount in the mutual fund."}, "years": {"type": "integer", "description": "The time period for which the investment is made in years."}}, "required": ["yearly_yield", "investment_amount", "years"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"estimate_mutual_fund_return1": {"yearly_yield": 0.05, "investment_amount": 2000, "years": 3}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"estimate_mutual_fund_return1": {"yearly_yield": 0.05, "investment_amount": 2000, "years": 3}}], "possible_answer": [{"estimate_mutual_fund_return1": {"yearly_yield": [5.0], "investment_amount": [2000], "years": [3]}}, {"estimate_mutual_fund_return2": {"yearly_yield": [5.0], "investment_amount": [2000], "years": [3]}}, {"estimate_mutual_fund_return3": {"yearly_yield": [5.0], "investment_amount": [2000], "years": [3]}}]}

This function call allows for the execution of both individual commands and a sequence of commands that are linked together using the '&&' operator. When commands are chained with '&&', each command is executed sequentially, and the execution of subsequent commands is contingent upon the successful completion of the preceding command.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'The function is designed explicitly for use on Windows operating systems and serves the purpose of executing system-level commands by utilizing the `os.system()` method. This method is part of the Python `os` module and is used to run shell commands directly from a Python script. The function is capable of executing both individual commands and a sequence of multiple commands that are connected with the '&&' operator. \n\nThe '&&' operator allows for the chaining of commands, meaning that each command will only execute if the preceding command completes successfully. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the execution of subsequent commands is contingent upon the successful execution of prior commands. For instance, if you need to compile a program and then run it, you can chain these commands with '&&' to ensure the program only runs if the compilation succeeds.\n\nWhen using this function, it's important to be aware of the context in which the commands are executed. The `os.system()` function initiates a subshell, and the commands are executed in this subshell. The function returns an exit status code indicating the success or failure of the command execution, where a return value of zero typically signifies successful execution and any non-zero value indicates an error.\n\nHere is an example of how you might use the function: if you want to create a directory and then navigate into it, you could pass the command string `\"mkdir new_folder && cd new_folder\"` to this function. This would first attempt to create a directory named \"new_folder\" and, upon successful creation, change the current directory to \"new_folder\".\n\nIt's essential to consider the security implications of executing system commands, as improper handling of input can lead to vulnerabilities such as code injection attacks. Therefore, always ensure that any user input used in the commands is properly validated and sanitized before execution.

This method allows the execution of commands that could be run directly from the Windows command prompt (CMD). It provides the flexibility to execute both singular commands and a sequence of multiple commands that can be strategically chained together using the '&&' operator.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.The function is designed to execute a system-level command specifically on Windows operating systems, utilizing the `os.system()` method from the Python standard library. This allows for direct interaction with the Windows command line interface, enabling the execution of commands as if they were being run manually by a user in a Command Prompt session.\n\nThis functionality supports the execution of a single command or multiple commands that are chained together using the '&&' operator. The '&&' operator in this context is used to concatenate multiple commands in such a way that each subsequent command is executed only if the preceding one succeeds. This means that if one command fails (returns a non-zero exit status), the following commands in the chain will not be executed. \n\nWhen using this function, it's important to ensure that the commands are properly formatted and compatible with the Windows command line syntax. The commands are passed as a single string argument to `os.system()`, which then interprets and executes them in the Windows environment. An example of a single command execution would be `os.system(\"dir\")`, which lists the directory contents. For multiple commands, you could use something like `os.system(\"cd C:\\\\ && dir\")`, which first changes the directory to the C: drive root and then lists its contents.\n\nIt is crucial to consider security implications, such as the potential for command injection if user input is incorporated into the command string. Proper validation and sanitization of inputs should be employed to mitigate such risks.

Accurate data on the annual distance traveled is crucial, as it directly impacts the emissions calculation. \n\n- **Fuel Type**: Different fuel types have varying carbon emissions per unit used. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, and natural gas, among others. Each type has a specific carbon emission factor, which is used to determine the amount of CO2 produced per unit of fuel consumed. For example, diesel generally emits more CO2 per gallon than gasoline.\n\n- **Fuel Efficiency**: This parameter measures the vehicle's efficiency in terms of fuel consumption, typically expressed in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). A higher fuel efficiency indicates that less fuel is required to cover the same distance, thereby potentially reducing the overall carbon emissions.\n\nThe function integrates these parameters to provide an estimate of the annual CO2 emissions. It is essential for the user to input accurate and realistic data for each parameter to ensure the calculation's reliability.

The progression will consist of a predetermined number of chords. Chord progressions are fundamental to the structure of music, providing the harmonic foundation upon which melodies and rhythms are built. By specifying both the key and the number of chords, users can tailor the progression to fit the mood and style they are aiming to achieve in their composition.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n- **Key**: This parameter determines the tonal center of the chord progression. It specifies the scale from which the chords will be derived. The key can be any of the 12 major or minor keys commonly used in Western music. For example, choosing a key of C major means that the generated chords will be based on the C major scale, which includes the notes C, D, E, F, G, A, and B.\n\n- **Number of Chords**: This parameter defines how many chords will make up the progression. The number can vary depending on the desired complexity and length of the musical piece. For instance, a simple chord progression might consist of four chords, which is a typical structure used in many pop and rock songs. More elaborate compositions might utilize eight or more chords to create intricate harmonic progressions.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\nSuppose you want to create a simple four-chord progression in the key of G major. You would call the function with \"G major\" as the key and \"4\" as the number of chords. The function would then output a progression using chords from the G major scale, such as G, C, D, and Em.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n\n- **Key not specified**: If the key is not specified, the function might default to a common key such as C major, which is often used since it contains no sharps or flats, making it straightforward for beginners.\n\n- **Number of", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"key": {"type": "string", "description": "The key for the chord progression."}, "chords": {"type": "integer", "description": "Number of chords in the progression."}, "progression_type": {"type": "string", "description": "The type of the chord progression.

The function operates by comparing the total value of each player's hand, including the dealer's, according to the rules of blackjack.\n\nThe function first assesses whether any player has a hand total of exactly 21, known as a \"blackjack,\" which is the optimal hand. If a player achieves this with their initial hand of two cards, they are declared the winner unless the dealer also has a blackjack, which would result in a tie, known as a \"push.\"\n\nIf no player has a blackjack, the function then checks for any hands that exceed 21, which is called a \"bust.\" Any player or the dealer with a hand total over 21 automatically loses, regardless of other hands.\n\nNext, the function compares the remaining valid hands (those 21 or under) to determine the highest value. The player with the highest valid hand total, closer to 21 than any other, is declared the winner, as long as their hand is higher than the dealer's. If the dealer's hand is higher, the dealer wins.

This function plays a critical role in the hotel reservation system, allowing users to reserve accommodations for their stay within the defined period.\n\n#### Essential Details:\n- **Purpose**: The primary goal of the `BookHotelRoom` function is to reserve a hotel room for guests for a continuous sequence of dates that the user selects. This ensures that accommodations are secured in advance, aligning with the customers' travel plans.\n\n- **Parameters**:\n  - **Start Date**: The beginning date of the reservation period. This parameter indicates the first day the room will be occupied by the guest.\n  - **End Date**: The concluding date of the reservation. It denotes the last day the guest will stay in the room before checking out.\n\n- **Functionality**: \n  - Upon invocation, the function checks the availability of rooms for the specified date range.\n  - It ensures that the start date is earlier than the end date, confirming that the request is logical and feasible.\n  - The function then allocates a room if availability is confirmed, marking it as reserved for the desired duration.\n  - If no rooms are available for the entire range, it may return an error or prompt the user to select alternative dates, depending on the implementation specifics.\n\n- **Edge Cases and Considerations**:\n  - The function should account for cases where the start date and end date are on the same day, accommodating for single-day reservations.\n  - It should handle scenarios where the provided date range overlaps partially with existing bookings, ensuring that only fully available dates are accepted.\n  - It is crucial for the function to validate that the dates provided fall within the hotel's operational calendar and are not in the past.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nA user intending to book a room from March 15, 2023, to March 20, 2023,", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"hotel_name": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the hotel."}, "location": {"type": "string", "description": "The city and state, e.g. New York, NY."}, "start_date": {"type": "string", "description": "The start date of the reservation.
