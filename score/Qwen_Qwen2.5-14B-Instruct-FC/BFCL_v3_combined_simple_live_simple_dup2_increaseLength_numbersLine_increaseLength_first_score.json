Prime factors are the set of prime numbers that multiply together to represent the original number. The function systematically breaks down the input number into its constituent prime components.\n\n#### Parameters\n- **number (int)**: A positive integer for which the function will determine the prime factors. The input should be greater than 1, as numbers less than 2 do not have prime factors.\n\n#### Returns\n- **List[int]**: A list containing the prime factors of the provided number. Each prime factor appears in the list as many times as it is used in the multiplication to achieve the original number. The list is sorted in ascending order.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n- If the input number is a prime number itself, the function will return a list containing just that number, as a prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.\n- The smallest prime factor for any positive integer greater than 1 is 2. If the input is an even number, the function will first divide by 2 repeatedly until it becomes odd.\n- For negative numbers or non-integer input, the function should raise an exception or handle the error gracefully, as prime factorization is defined only for positive integers.\n\n#### Usage Example\n```python\n# Example 1: Prime factors of 28\n# 28 can be expressed as 2 * 2 * 7\nprime_factors(28)\n# Output: [2, 2, 7]\n\n# Example 2: Prime factors of a prime number like 13\nprime_factors(13)\n# Output: [13]\n\n# Example 3: Prime factors of 100\n# 100 can be expressed as 2 * 2 * 5 * 5\nprime_factors(100)\n# Output: [2, 2, 5, 5]\n```\n\n####", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"number": {"type": "integer", "description": "Number for which prime factors need to be calculated"}, "formatted": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Return formatted string if true, array if false.

An isothermal process is characterized by maintaining a constant temperature throughout the process, meaning that any heat exchange with the surroundings does not result in a change in temperature of the system. A reversible process is an idealized or hypothetical process that occurs in such a way that the system and its surroundings can be returned to their initial states by exactly reversing the process without any increase in entropy.\n\nIn thermodynamics, entropy is a measure of the amount of energy in a physical system that is not available to do work, often associated with the degree of disorder or randomness in the system. The change in entropy, denoted as \u0394S, during a reversible process can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\u0394S = Q_rev / T,\n\nwhere Q_rev is the amount of reversible heat exchange (in joules) and T is the absolute temperature (in Kelvin) at which the process occurs. Since the process is isothermal, the temperature remains constant, simplifying the calculation of entropy change.\n\nThis function is particularly useful in theoretical physics and engineering contexts where understanding the flow of energy and the efficiency of processes is crucial. It is important to note that this calculation assumes ideal conditions and may not accurately predict entropy changes in real-world, irreversible processes due to additional factors like friction, turbulence, or non-ideal material behavior.\n\nExample Usage:\n- To calculate the entropy change for a gas expanding reversibly and isothermally when it absorbs 1000 J of heat at a constant temperature of 300 K, you can use the formula as follows: \u0394S = 1000 / 300 = 3.33 J/K.

This calculation is crucial for applications that involve clock face simulations, time visualization tools, or any scenario where the spatial relationship between the clock hands needs to be understood.\n\nTo achieve this, the function first calculates the positions of the hour and minute hands in terms of degrees. The clock face is divided into 360 degrees, with each hour marking a 30-degree segment since there are 12 hours on a clock (360 degrees / 12 hours = 30 degrees per hour). Similarly, each minute represents a 6-degree movement from the 12 o'clock position (360 degrees / 60 minutes = 6 degrees per minute).\n\nFor the hour hand, its position is determined not only by the hour itself but also by how far it has moved towards the next hour based on the current minute. This is calculated by:\n\n- Hour angle = (Hour % 12) * 30 + (Minutes / 60) * 30\n\nThis formula considers the hour hand's movement as it transitions smoothly between the numbered hour marks.\n\nFor the minute hand, the position is straightforward:\n\n- Minute angle = Minutes * 6\n\nOnce both angles are calculated, the function finds the absolute difference between the two angles to determine the angle between the hour and minute hands. However, since there are two possible angles (one clockwise and one counterclockwise), the function returns the smaller of the two. This is done by ensuring that the angle is the smallest by taking the minimum of the calculated angle and its complement to 360 degrees:\n\n- Angle between hands = min(|Hour angle - Minute angle|, 360 - |Hour angle - Minute angle|)\n\nEdge cases include handling times where one or both of the hour and minute values are zero, ensuring that calculations correctly translate positions at critical times like noon or midnight.

The function returns the total amount with tax.This function is designed to calculate the applicable sales tax based on a specified purchase amount and the jurisdiction in which the purchase is made. The jurisdiction determines the tax rate that should be applied, which may vary significantly between different regions or areas. The function takes into account this variability and applies the correct tax rate corresponding to the given jurisdiction.\n\nWhen the function is executed, it first retrieves the relevant sales tax rate for the specified jurisdiction. This could involve looking up the tax rate from a predefined list or database that contains the tax rates for various jurisdictions. Once the appropriate tax rate is determined, the function calculates the sales tax by applying this rate to the purchase amount provided as an input parameter.\n\nThe result of this calculation is then added to the original purchase amount to yield the total amount, inclusive of sales tax.

To achieve this, the function utilizes a pre-trained question-answering model from the Hugging Face Transformers library, which is a popular collection of state-of-the-art machine learning models designed for natural language processing tasks.\n\nWhen invoking this function, users must supply an image file, which should be in a compatible format such as JPEG, PNG, or another common image file type. The image is processed to extract relevant visual information that can assist in answering the question accurately. The other required input is a text-based question, typically in the form of a string, that pertains to the content depicted in the image.\n\nThe function leverages the capabilities of the pre-trained model, which has been fine-tuned on extensive datasets to understand various types of questions and generate contextually appropriate responses. By using the transformers library, the function can efficiently handle the natural language understanding component of the task, which involves interpreting the question and mapping it to the visual elements detected in the image.\n\nAn edge case to consider is the clarity and relevance of the question in relation to the image. The model's ability to provide a precise answer heavily depends on the specificity and correctness of the question. Additionally, the image must contain discernible features that the model can analyze to produce a meaningful answer.\n\nAs an example, if the image is a photograph of a beach, and the question is, \"What color is the ocean?\" the function would process both inputs to provide an answer such as \"The ocean is blue.\" However, if the question is unrelated or ambiguous, such as \"What is happening here?\" without clear context, the function may struggle to generate an appropriate response.\n\nOverall, this function is an integration of image processing and language understanding, harnessing the power of advanced machine learning techniques to deliver practical and insightful answers", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["image_path", "question", "model"], "properties": {"image_path": {"type": "string", "description": "The file path to the image on which the question is based, in the format of 'folder/subfolder/image.png'."}, "question": {"type": "string", "description": "The question to be answered, related to the content of the provided image."}, "model": {"type": "any", "description": "The pre-loaded question-answering model from the Hugging Face Transformers library used to answer the question."}}}}, {"name": "process_data2", "description": "Processes an image and a question to provide an answer using a pre-trained question-answering model from the Hugging Face Transformers library.

This function acts as an interface to the underlying operating system, allowing for the execution of command-line instructions directly from within a Python script. \n\nWhen you use `os.system()`, it takes a single string argument which represents the command you wish to execute. This string should be formatted in the same way as if you were typing it directly into the Windows command prompt. The `os.system()` function then passes this command to the operating system's command processor and executes it.\n\nAlthough `os.system()` is straightforward to use, it's essential to note that it does not capture the output of the executed command; it simply runs the command as a sub-process. As such, any output from the command will be sent directly to the standard output (stdout), typically the console from which the script was run. Additionally, `os.system()` returns the exit status of the command run, which can be checked to determine if the command executed successfully (an exit code of zero) or if there was an error (a non-zero exit code).\n\nAn edge case to consider is the handling of special shell characters or spaces in your command. If your command includes such characters, you may need to ensure they are properly escaped or quoted to avoid unexpected behavior. For example, if the command includes a file path with spaces, it should be enclosed in quotes.\n\nUsage example:\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Example command that lists directory contents\ncommand = 'dir'  # On Windows, 'dir' will list the contents of the current directory\nexit_status = os.system(command)\n\nif exit_status == 0:\n    print(\"Command executed successfully.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Command failed with exit status:\", exit_status)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `os.system()` function is used to execute the 'dir' command, which lists files", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The command line instruction to be passed to os.system() for execution, formatted as a Windows command prompt statement."}, "unit": {"type": "string", "description": "The unit of measurement for the command execution time, such as 'seconds' or 'milliseconds'", "enum": ["seconds", "milliseconds"], "default": "N/A"}}}}, {"name": "cmd_controller.execute2", "description": "Executes a specified command in the Windows operating system using the os.system() function.

This function is capable of running individual commands, as well as multiple commands that are concatenated or chained together using the logical operator '&&'. When multiple commands are chained with '&&', each command is executed sequentially, and the next command is only executed if the previous one was successful.\n\nFor instance, if you want to execute a single command like opening the Windows Notepad, you could call the function with the command 'notepad'.

In this example, the directory will only be listed if it is successfully created.\n\nIt's important to note that while using `os.system()`, the function will return the exit status code of the shell command. An exit status of `0` usually indicates that the command was successful, while any non-zero value indicates some form of error or issue encountered during the command execution. Additionally, this function is synchronous, meaning it will wait for the command execution to complete before proceeding with the next line of code.\n\nWhen using this function, ensure that the commands are properly formatted and valid within the context of the Windows command shell, as invalid commands will lead to errors and non-zero exit codes.

The `os.system()` function is a part of Python's standard library and provides a way to interface with the system shell. This allows for the execution of shell commands directly from within a Python script. \n\nThe function is capable of executing a single command, such as launching an application or running a script. Additionally, it supports the execution of multiple commands by chaining them together using the '&&' operator. The '&&' operator is a logical AND that can be used in command strings to ensure that subsequent commands are only executed if the previous command is successful. This means that if the first command fails, any commands following the '&&' will not be executed. \n\nFor example, if you wanted to first create a directory and then navigate into it, you could use a command string like `mkdir new_folder && cd new_folder`. Here, `mkdir new_folder` will create the directory, and if successful, the command `cd new_folder` will change the current directory to `new_folder`.\n\nWhen using this function, it is important to consider the security implications of executing system commands, especially if any part of the command string is constructed based on user input. Care should be taken to sanitize any inputs to prevent potential command injection attacks.\n\nFurthermore, the `os.system()` function passes the command to the system's command processor, such as `cmd` on Windows, which executes it in a subshell. The function will return the exit status code of the command executed. A return value of `0` typically indicates success, while a non-zero value indicates some form of error or failure during execution.\n\nThis function is a convenient way to leverage system capabilities directly from a Python script, simplifying the automation of tasks that require command-line operations.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.This function is designed to execute system-level commands specifically on Windows operating systems by utilizing the `os.system()` function from Python's `os` module. The `os.system()` function allows users to issue commands to the underlying operating system, facilitating tasks such as running executables, managing files and directories, or querying system information directly from a Python script.\n\nThe function is capable of executing not just a single command, but also multiple commands that are chained together. Command chaining is achieved by using the '&&' operator, a logical AND operator in shell scripting, which ensures that each subsequent command is executed only if the preceding command succeeds without errors.\n\nFor instance, if you issue a command such as `os.system(\"command1 && command2 && command3\")`, the system will execute `command1` first. If `command1` executes successfully (returns a zero exit status), then `command2` will be executed next. Similarly, if `command2` is successful, `command3` will then be executed. If any command fails, the subsequent commands in the chain will not be executed.\n\nThis chaining feature is particularly useful for complex operations where the success of a sequence of commands is interdependent, allowing for conditional execution based on the outcome of previous commands.\n\nWhen using `os.system()`, it is important to note that it does not capture output from the executed commands. It simply executes the commands and returns the exit status.

This function is particularly tailored for scenarios where you need to run shell commands directly from a Python script. \n\nWhen using this function to execute multiple commands in sequence, you should separate each command with the '&&' operator. This ensures that commands are executed one after the other in the specified order, and execution will stop if any command fails. This chaining is particularly useful for tasks that depend on the successful completion of previous commands.\n\nHowever, if the sequence of commands is complex or involves intricate logic, it is recommended to encapsulate the logic within a batch file\u2014commonly known as a `.bat` file on Windows systems. This approach simplifies the command execution process by allowing you to write and organize your commands, loops, and other control statements within the file. You can then execute this batch file using the `os.system()` function, which passes the command to the Windows command line interpreter (`cmd.exe`).\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how to use the function:\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Single command execution\nos.system('dir')\n\n# Multiple command execution\nos.system('cd C:\\\\ && dir')\n\n# Executing a batch file\nos.system('C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\your\\\\script.bat')\n```\n\nIn these examples, `os.system('dir')` will list the contents of the current directory. When executing multiple commands, `os.system('cd C:\\\\ && dir')` will change the directory to the root of the C drive and then list its contents. For more advanced operations, such as setting environment variables or looping through commands, consider creating a batch file and running it through `os.system('C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\your\\\\script.bat')`. \n\nBe aware that the `os.system()` function returns a system-dependent status code, which can be used to determine the success or failure of the", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The Windows command line instruction(s) to be executed.

The calculation is based on three critical parameters: the distance traveled by the vehicle over the course of a year, the type of fuel used by the vehicle, and the vehicle's fuel efficiency. \n\n1. **Distance Traveled:** This parameter represents the total distance that the vehicle covers in a year, typically measured in kilometers or miles. It is an essential factor because the amount of CO2 emissions is directly proportional to how far the vehicle travels. The greater the distance, the more emissions are expected, provided other factors remain constant.\n\n2. **Fuel Type:** This refers to the kind of fuel the vehicle uses, such as gasoline, diesel, or alternative fuels like ethanol or natural gas. Each fuel type has a specific carbon content, and the emissions calculation will vary depending on the carbon intensity associated with the combustion of that particular fuel. For instance, gasoline and diesel have different emission factors, affecting the total CO2 emissions calculated.\n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency:** This parameter indicates how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel to travel a given distance, typically stated in terms of liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km) or miles per gallon (mpg). Higher fuel efficiency means that the vehicle consumes less fuel for the same distance, resulting in lower CO2 emissions. Conversely, lower efficiency leads to higher emissions.\n\nThe function combines these parameters to estimate the total CO2 emissions for the year. It considers how the interplay between the distance traveled, the fuel type used, and the vehicle's fuel efficiency impacts the overall emissions output. For instance, even if a vehicle travels a substantial distance, if it uses a fuel with a low carbon content or has high fuel efficiency, the emissions might remain relatively low. Conversely, a vehicle with poor fuel efficiency using a high-carbon fuel type will likely produce higher emissions over the same distance.\n\nIn summary, this function provides a crucial environmental metric by allowing individuals, organizations,", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"distance": {"type": "integer", "description": "The distance travelled in miles."}, "fuel_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of fuel used by the vehicle."}, "fuel_efficiency": {"type": "float", "description": "The vehicle's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon."}, "efficiency_reduction": {"type": "integer", "description": "The percentage decrease in fuel efficiency per year (optional).

The calculation focuses on determining the amount of emissions that could be avoided by making this energy transition, thereby contributing to environmental sustainability efforts.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- **current_emissions (float):** This parameter represents the amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced by the current energy source over a specific period, typically measured in tons of CO2-equivalent gases. It serves as the baseline from which potential savings are calculated.\n\n- **renewable_emissions (float):** This parameter indicates the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the renewable energy source selected for comparison. Although renewable sources generally produce significantly lower emissions, this parameter accounts for any emissions that might occur during manufacturing, installation, or maintenance of renewable energy systems.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- **emissions_saved (float):** The function returns a floating-point number that quantifies the potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. It is calculated by subtracting the emissions produced by the renewable energy source from those produced by the current energy source.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\nConsider a scenario where a coal-powered plant emits 10,000 tons of CO2-equivalent gases annually. By switching to a solar power system that generates 500 tons of emissions per year, the function can be used to compute the emissions saved with the following invocation:\n\n```python\nemissions_saved = calculate_emissions_saved(10000, 500)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `emissions_saved` will be 9,500 tons, representing the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions achieved by the transition.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\nThe function should handle situations where the emissions from the renewable source are equal to or greater than those from the current source.

This transition helps maintain the quality and continuity of the user experience. \n\nTo achieve this, the function monitors the interaction between the automated system and the user, actively assessing whether the questions posed fall outside the scope of the system's programmed responses or knowledge base.

This function is particularly useful for musicians, composers, and music theorists who need to understand harmonic structures or create chord progressions. \n\nWhen you provide the function with a key, it analyzes the notes that comprise that key's scale. The function then identifies the third chord, counting from the tonic, which is constructed using the major scale pattern. It\u2019s important to note that in Western music theory, a major chord is typically built using the first (root), third, and fifth notes of the scale. This function specifically targets the third position major chord within the sequence of triads that can be derived from the given key.\n\nFor instance, if the given key is C major, the function will calculate the third major chord in this key. In the C major scale (C, D, E, F, G, A, B), the third chord is E minor when considering the diatonic triads, but if the focus is solely on major chords, it will identify the next major chord after C major and G major, which does not exist in the basic major scale triads of C major.\n\nIn terms of usage, the function typically requires input specifying the desired key. This key can be represented in various forms, such as a string indicating the key signature (e.g., \"C major\" or \"G# major\"). The result is the name of the major chord that is third in the sequence of major chords possible in that key, or an indication that only two major chords are typically present within a diatonic major scale before repeating the cycle.\n\nThis function is highly relevant in music education and the development of software applications that analyze or generate music.

To achieve its purpose, the function requires three key parameters:\n\n1. **City**: This parameter specifies the geographical location in which the user is interested. It should be provided as a string representing the name of the city. The function utilizes this input to narrow down the search to sushi places within the specified city. It is important to ensure that the city name is spelled correctly and is recognized by the system's database for accurate results.\n\n2. **Review Rate**: This parameter indicates the threshold for customer satisfaction ratings that must be met or exceeded for a sushi place to be considered. It is typically represented as a numerical value, often on a scale from 1 to 5, with higher numbers indicating better reviews. This criterion ensures that only sushi places with a satisfactory level of customer feedback are included in the results. If no places meet the specified review rate, the function might return an empty list.\n\n3. **Top Number**: This parameter specifies the number of top-rated sushi places the user wants to retrieve. It should be provided as a positive integer. The function will sort the sushi places meeting the review rate criterion in descending order of their ratings and select the top entries up to the number specified by this parameter. If there are fewer places that qualify than the number requested, the function will return as many as are available.\n\n### Usage Example\n\nConsider a scenario where a user wishes to find the top 3 sushi places in \"San Francisco\" with a minimum review rate of 4.5.

For example, if you are converting from USD to EUR, and the exchange rate is 0.85, the function will return 0.85.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n- Ensure that both the `currency_from` and `currency_to` parameters are valid ISO 4217 currency codes; otherwise, the function may return an error or undefined result.\n- If the exchange rate data is temporarily unavailable due to network issues or service downtime, the function might return a cached rate or an error message indicating unavailability.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n```python\n# Example 1: Retrieve the exchange rate from USD to EUR\nrate = get_exchange_rate(\"USD\", \"EUR\")\nprint(f\"The current exchange rate from USD to EUR is {rate}\")\n\n# Example 2: Retrieve the exchange rate from GBP to JPY\nrate = get_exchange_rate(\"GBP\", \"JPY\")\nprint(f\"The current exchange rate from GBP to JPY is {rate}\")\n```\n\nThis functionality is essential for applications in the financial, travel, and e-commerce sectors where timely and accurate currency exchange rates are crucial for decision-making and financial transactions.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"source_currency": {"type": "string", "description": "The currency you are converting from."}, "target_currency": {"type": "string", "description": "The currency you are converting to."}, "amount": {"type": "float", "description": "The amount to be converted.
