It is designed to provide a straightforward method for determining how much space the triangle occupies on a two-dimensional plane, given these two parameters.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **base (b)**: A numerical value representing the length of the base of the triangle. This value should be a positive number, as negative or zero values would not logically represent a physical dimension of a triangle.\n  \n- **height (h)**: A numerical value representing the perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite vertex of the triangle, also known as altitude. Similar to the base, this should be a positive number to ensure it accurately reflects a physical property of the triangle.\n\n#### Formula:\n\nThe area \\( A \\) of a triangle is calculated using the formula:\n\\[ A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\]\n\nThis formula derives from the understanding that the area of a triangle is essentially half the area of a rectangle with the same base and height.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- If either the base or the height is zero, the resulting area will be zero because a triangle with no height or no base does not occupy any space.\n- Negative values for base or height are not valid inputs, as dimensions cannot be negative in standard geometric interpretations.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nConsider a triangle with a base of 5 units and a height of 10 units. Using the function:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 5 \\times 10 = 25 \\]\nThus, the area of the triangle is 25 square units.\n\nThis function is particularly useful in various fields such as architecture, engineering, and any geometric calculations where understanding the spatial coverage of a triangular shape is necessary.

This calculation is grounded in the principles of kinematics, where the relationship between velocity, acceleration, and distance is defined mathematically. The function utilizes the kinematic equation for motion: \n\n\\[ v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2 \\cdot a \\cdot d \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( v_f \\) represents the final velocity of the object,\n- \\( v_i \\) is the initial velocity, which in this case is zero,\n- \\( a \\) is the constant acceleration, and\n- \\( d \\) denotes the distance traveled by the object.\n\nGiven that the initial velocity \\( v_i \\) is zero, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ v_f = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot a \\cdot d} \\]\n\nThis implies that the final velocity is calculated as the square root of twice the product of acceleration and distance. The function assumes that the acceleration remains constant over the entire distance traveled, and there are no other forces acting on the object that would alter its motion, such as friction or air resistance. This makes the function suitable for ideal conditions often used in physics problems.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `acceleration (a)`: A positive or negative float value indicating the constant rate of change of velocity per unit time. Positive values imply acceleration, while negative values imply deceleration.\n- `distance (d)`: A non-negative float value representing the total displacement or distance covered by the object in the direction of the acceleration.\n\n**Returns:**\n- `final_velocity (v_f)`: A float value that is the calculated final velocity of the object after traveling the specified distance with the given acceleration.\n\n**Usage Example:**\nSuppose an object starts from rest and accelerates at a rate of 3 meters per second squared over a distance of 50 meters", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"acceleration": {"type": "integer", "description": "Acceleration of the object, m/s^2."}, "distance": {"type": "integer", "description": "Distance traveled by the object, m."}, "initial_velocity": {"type": "float", "description": "Initial velocity of the object.

It returns the string directly if an answer is found within it. Should the output indicate that no answer was found, an empty string is returned instead.This function is designed to systematically analyze the output generated by a language model, which is typically a sequence of text. The primary goal of this function is to determine whether a definitive answer is present within that string of text.

The function then inspects this string to check for the presence of an answer. \n\nIf the string contains a valid answer\u2014that is, an answer is clearly identified and can be extracted\u2014the function will return this string directly.

This empty string serves as a signal to the calling process that the language model's output did not contain any useful answer, allowing the system to handle such cases appropriately, perhaps by triggering alternative actions or notifying users of the lack of an answer.\n\nIn summary, this function acts as a filter to discern the presence or absence of answers in text output from a language model, returning the output unchanged if an answer is found, or an empty string if no answer is detected.

This could be particularly important in situations where sequential commands need to be sent to achieve a specific operational state for the appliance. \n\nFor example, if you are controlling a smart thermostat, you might use this function to send a temperature setting as the single value. In this case, the value could represent the desired temperature in degrees, and each call would adjust the thermostat to the specified setting. \n\nAdditionally, users need to be aware of the format and type of value that the appliance can accept. This often requires consulting the appliance\u2019s manual or API documentation to ensure compatibility and avoid errors. It is also important to consider any potential network issues or latencies that might affect the successful transmission of the command to the appliance. \n\nIn summary, the function provides a straightforward interface for sending a single command value to an appliance, emphasizing the importance of selecting the correct value to achieve the intended control effect.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["body"], "properties": {"body": {"type": "dict", "description": "A dictionary containing the parameters for the appliance command.", "properties": {"airConJobMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The current job mode of the air conditioner.", "enum": ["AIR_CLEAN", "COOL", "AIR_DRY"], "default": "COOL"}, "windStrength": {"type": "string", "description": "The strength of the air flow.", "enum": ["LOW", "HIGH", "MID"], "default": "MID"}, "monitoringEnabled": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether air quality sensor monitoring is enabled.", "default": false}, "airCleanOperationMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The operation mode for the air cleaning function.", "enum": ["START", "STOP"], "default": "STOP"}, "airConOperationMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The operation mode for the air conditioner, indicating if it is turned on or off.", "enum": ["POWER_ON", "POWER_OFF"], "default": "POWER_OFF"}, "powerSaveEnabled": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether power save mode is enabled to conserve energy.", "default": false}, "targetTemperature": {"type": "integer", "description": "The target temperature to set for the appliance, in degrees Celsius.", "default": 20}, "relativeHourToStop": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of hours from the current time when the appliance should stop.

Returns a list of times in seconds, each representing the occurrence of a significant beat within the audio file.This function is designed to perform a comprehensive analysis of an audio file with the primary objective of detecting beats throughout the file. The detection process involves identifying the rhythmic pulses that are perceived as the basic unit of time in a piece of music. The function not only detects these beats but also applies a filtering mechanism to ensure that only beats meeting certain criteria are considered.\n\nThe filtering process is based on two main factors: confidence levels and timing. Confidence levels refer to the certainty with which a detected beat can be classified as significant, eliminating false positives or uncertain detections that may arise due to noise or indistinct audio features. The function discards beats with low confidence, ensuring that the final output consists only of those beats that are identified with a high degree of certainty.\n\nTiming, on the other hand, involves assessing the intervals and consistency of detected beats to maintain the rhythmic integrity of the music. This filtering ensures that only those beats that align with the anticipated timing patterns of the audio file are retained.\n\nThe output of this function is a list, where each element is a time value specified in seconds. These time values signify the exact moments within the audio file when significant beats occur. For instance, if a beat is detected at 1.5 seconds and another at 3.75 seconds, the function will return a list containing these values: [1.5, 3.75].

It accomplishes this by determining the positions of each hand relative to 12 o'clock and then computes the angle formed between them.\n\n### How the Function Works:\n1. **Input Parameters**: The function requires two input parameters representing the time of interest: \n   - `hour`: An integer value ranging from 0 to 23, representing the hour portion of the time. This allows for calculation in both AM and PM formats.\n   - `minute`: An integer value ranging from 0 to 59, indicating the minute portion of the time.\n\n2. **Position Calculation**:\n   - **Hour Hand Position**: The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours. Therefore, it moves 30 degrees per hour (360 degrees / 12 hours). Additionally, for every minute that passes, the hour hand moves 0.5 degrees (30 degrees / 60 minutes).\n   - **Minute Hand Position**: The minute hand completes a full circle, or 360 degrees, in 60 minutes. Hence, it moves 6 degrees per minute (360 degrees / 60 minutes).\n\n3. **Angle Calculation**:\n   - **Raw Angle**: The function first calculates the absolute difference between the angles of the hour and minute hands.\n   - **Minimal Angle**: Since the clock is circular, the function determines the smaller angle. This is done by taking the minimum between the raw angle and 360 degrees minus the raw angle, ensuring that the angle is always 180 degrees or less.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- **Exact hour**: If the minute is set to zero, the calculation must handle the scenario where the minute hand is at the 12 o'clock position, and the position of the hour hand is straightforwardly `hour * 30` degrees.\n- **Midnight and Noon**: These times are special cases", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"hours": {"type": "integer", "description": "The hour on the clock face."}, "minutes": {"type": "integer", "description": "The minutes on the clock face."}, "round_to": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of decimal places to round the result to, default is 2."}}, "required": ["hours", "minutes"]}}, {"name": "calculate_clock_angle2", "description": "Calculate the angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock at a given time.Example: calculate_clock_angle(hours=3, minutes=15) returns 7.5\n\nExample: calculate_clock_angle(hours=9, minutes=0) returns 90.0\n\nExample: calculate_clock_angle(hours=12, minutes=30, round_to=1) returns 165.0", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"hours": {"type": "integer", "description": "The hour on the clock face."}, "minutes": {"type": "integer", "description": "The minutes on the clock face."}, "round_to": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of decimal places to round the result to, default is 2."}}, "required": ["hours", "minutes"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\nThe angle between the hour and minute hands at 6:30 PM can be calculated using the provided functions.

These may include the coordinates of each celestial body, such as right ascension and declination, if the bodies are stars, or the orbital elements if they are planets or moons. The function may use various distance calculation methods, such as the Haversine formula for spherical coordinates, or even more sophisticated algorithms for three-dimensional space given the vast distances involved in astronomical observations.\n\nIn terms of implementation, the function might also take into account factors such as the motion of the celestial bodies, which can affect their positions over time.

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees at training time and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. This method is highly effective in handling both regression and classification tasks and is known for its robustness, accuracy, and ability to manage large datasets with higher dimensionality.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **data**: The input dataset on which the Random Forest model will be trained. This dataset should include both features and target variables. It is essential that the data is preprocessed correctly, with any missing values addressed and categorical variables appropriately encoded. The quality and representation of the input data can significantly impact the performance of the trained model.\n\n- **target_variable**: The specific column or feature within the dataset that the model should predict. This target variable can be categorical or continuous, depending on whether the task is classification or regression, respectively.\n\n- **n_estimators (optional)**: The number of trees in the forest. More trees can improve accuracy but also increase computation time. Typically, users might set this parameter to a default like 100 if not specified otherwise.\n\n- **max_depth (optional)**: The maximum depth of each tree. Limiting the depth of the tree helps prevent overfitting. Setting this to `None` allows nodes to expand until all leaves are pure or contain fewer than `min_samples_split` samples.\n\n- **random_state (optional)**: A seed used by the random number generator. Setting a random state ensures reproducible results by initializing the random number generator in the same state every time the code is run.\n\n#### Returns:\n\n- **model**: The trained Random Forest model object. This object encapsulates the learned patterns and rules from the dataset and can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\n```python", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"n_estimators": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of trees in the forest."}, "max_depth": {"type": "integer", "description": "The maximum depth of the tree."}, "data": {"type": "any", "description": "The training data for the model."}}, "required": ["n_estimators", "max_depth", "data"]}}, {"name": "random_forest.train2", "description": "Train a Random Forest Model on given dataExample: random_forest.train(n_estimators=100, max_depth=10, data=training_data)", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"n_estimators": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of trees in the forest."}, "max_depth": {"type": "integer", "description": "The maximum depth of the tree."}, "data": {"type": "any", "description": "The training data for the model."}}, "required": ["n_estimators", "max_depth", "data"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\n[ random_forest.train1(n_estimators=100, max_depth=5, data=my_data) ]", "possible_answer": [{"random_forest.train1": {"n_estimators": [100], "max_depth": [5], "data": ["my_data"]}}, {"random_forest.train2": {"n_estimators": [100], "max_depth": [5], "data": ["my_data"]}}, {"random_forest.train3": {"n_estimators": [100], "max_depth": [5], "data": ["my_data"]}}]}

By mapping each query to its corresponding intent name, the function facilitates the categorization process, ensuring that all queries are accurately grouped according to their intents. \n\nFor edge cases, consider scenarios where a query might not have a corresponding intent name provided, or where multiple queries may fall under the same intent.

Allows for the bulk recording of query classifications in one function call.This function is designed to efficiently manage and record the classification of a large number of queries by associating them with specific intent names. It achieves this by leveraging keyword arguments, where each keyword corresponds to an intent name, and the associated value is a collection of queries that share this intent. By using this approach, users can perform bulk recordings of query classifications in a single function call, significantly streamlining the process.\n\n### Parameters\n\n- **intent_name**: Keyword arguments where each keyword represents the name of an intent. This acts as a label that describes the purpose or goal of the queries associated with it.\n\n- **queries**: The values that accompany each intent name keyword argument. These are the actual queries that need to be classified. They can be provided in various iterable forms, such as lists or tuples, allowing for flexibility in input data structures.\n\n### Functionality\n\nWhen you call this function, it processes each keyword argument, taking the name of the keyword as the intent and the corresponding value as the list of queries. The function then records the association between each query and its intent, effectively classifying them in bulk. This method is particularly useful for applications that require organizing a large number of queries systematically, such as natural language processing tasks, chatbots, or automated customer service systems.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- If no queries are provided for a given intent, the function will simply record the intent with an empty list of queries, ensuring that all intents are processed but without any associated data.\n  \n- If duplicate queries are provided under the same intent, the function will still record each instance, as this might be intentional depending on the use case (e.g., tracking frequency of certain queries).\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\n# Example of how to call the function with multiple intents and their associated queries\nrecord_classifications(\n    greeting=[\"Hello\", \"Hi there\", \"Good morning\"],\n    farewell=[\"Goodbye\", \"See you later\", \"Take care\"],\n    inquiry=[\"What's the weather", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["acc_routing_start", "atm_finder_start", "faq_link_accounts_start", "get_balance_start", "get_transactions_start", "outofscope"], "properties": {"acc_routing_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries requesting the bank routing numbers or account numbers."}, "atm_finder_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for locations of ATMs, specified in the format of 'City, State (abbr)', such as 'Berkeley, CA' or 'New York, NY'."}, "faq_link_accounts_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to linking accounts within the bank's system."}, "get_balance_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for account balances, available funds, or other financial balances."}, "get_transactions_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to viewing transactions, deposits, purchases, and transaction details."}, "outofscope": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries that do not classify to any other available intents."}}}}, {"name": "record2", "description": "Records classifications for a series of queries based on the intent names provided as keyword arguments.

The NPV calculation is fundamental in financial analysis as it aids in determining the value of an investment by discounting future cash flows to their present value, thereby allowing for an assessment of profitability.\n\nTo perform this calculation, the function requires a series of cash flows, which are usually represented as a list or an array, where each element corresponds to a cash flow occurring at a specific time period. These cash flows may include both incoming cash, such as revenue, and outgoing cash, such as expenses or initial investments.\n\nThe function also requires an interest rate, often called the discount rate, which is a critical parameter in the NPV calculation. The discount rate reflects the time value of money, risk associated with the investment, and opportunity cost. It's used to discount future cash flows back to their present value, providing a comprehensive view of the project's worth today.\n\nFor each cash flow in the series, the function applies the formula for Net Present Value: NPV = \u03a3 (C_t / (1 + r)^t), where C_t represents the cash flow at time t, r is the discount rate, and t is the time period. This formula ensures that each future cash flow is appropriately adjusted for the time value of money.\n\nEdge cases to consider when using this function include scenarios where cash flows are zero or negative across all periods, which would result in an NPV of zero or a negative value, respectively. Additionally, attention should be paid to the choice of the discount rate, as an excessively high or low rate can significantly affect the NPV outcome, potentially leading to misleading investment decisions.\n\nHere is a simple usage example:\n\n```python\ncash_flows = [-1000, 300, 400, 500, 600]\ndiscount_rate = 0.05\n\nnpv = calculate_npv(c", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"cash_flows": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "integer"}, "description": "A list of cash flows."}, "discount_rate": {"type": "float", "description": "The annual interest rate used to discount the cash flows."}, "years": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "integer"}, "description": "A list of years when the cash flow occurs.

It utilizes three primary input parameters: the yearly yield, the investment amount, and the time period. Here is a detailed breakdown of each component involved in the calculation:\n\n1. **Yearly Yield**: This parameter represents the rate of return that the mutual fund is expected to generate annually. It is typically expressed as a percentage. The yearly yield is crucial as it directly impacts the growth rate of the investment over time. For example, a yearly yield of 5% suggests that the fund is projected to grow by 5% each year.\n\n2. **Investment Amount**: This specifies the initial sum of money that is invested in the mutual fund. It is an essential input because the final estimated return is proportional to the amount of capital invested. A higher investment amount will generally result in a higher estimated return, assuming the yield and time period remain constant.\n\n3. **Time Period**: This parameter indicates the duration, usually measured in years, for which the investment is held in the mutual fund. The time period is significant because the effect of compounding can increase the return over longer durations. For instance, leaving the investment for a longer period can lead to a greater cumulative return due to the compounding effect on the yearly yield.\n\nThe function processes these inputs to estimate the total return at the end of the specified time period. It assumes that the yearly yield is consistent throughout the investment period and that there are no additional contributions or withdrawals from the original investment amount during this time.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\nTo understand how this function operates, consider the following example:\n\nSuppose you are assessing the potential return on a mutual fund with a yearly yield of 7%, an initial investment amount of $10,000, and a time period of 5 years.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.This function is designed to execute system-level commands specifically on Windows operating systems by leveraging the `os.system()` method from Python's standard library. The primary purpose of this function is to run commands directly in the operating system's command-line interface (CLI), which is generally the Command Prompt on Windows.\n\nA notable feature of this function is its ability to execute not just a single command, but also multiple commands chained together. This chaining is accomplished using the '&&' operator, which allows for the sequential execution of commands. When commands are chained with '&&', each subsequent command will only execute if the preceding command has completed successfully. This is particularly useful for executing a series of dependent commands where the success of one command is a prerequisite for the execution of the next.\n\nFor example, you might use this function to first navigate to a specific directory using the `cd` command and then list the contents of that directory with the `dir` command, all in one go:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.system(\"cd C:\\\\Users && dir\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the `cd C:\\\\Users` command changes the directory to the specified path, and if successful, the `dir` command lists the contents of that directory. If the `cd` command fails, the `dir` command will not be executed.\n\nIt is important to note that the `os.system()` function returns the exit status of the command run. A return code of `0` typically indicates that the command was successful, while a non-zero return code indicates an error occurred during execution. This return value can be used to perform further error handling or logging within your program.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.This function is designed to execute system-level commands specifically on Windows operating systems by leveraging the capabilities of the `os.system()` function, which is part of Python's standard library. The primary purpose of this function is to allow users to pass command-line instructions directly to the operating system for execution. It is particularly useful for automating tasks that would otherwise require manual input in a command prompt window.\n\nThe function can handle both single commands and multiple commands that are chained together using the logical AND operator, represented by '&&'. When multiple commands are chained with '&&', each command is executed sequentially, and execution only continues to the next command if the previous command completes successfully. This behavior can be particularly beneficial in scenarios where the outcome of one command is a prerequisite for the subsequent command to execute correctly. For instance, you could use this functionality to compile a program and, if successful, immediately proceed to execute the compiled program.\n\nIt's important to note that this function is intended exclusively for use on Windows operating systems, as the execution of system commands may vary across different environments, and the syntax for chaining commands with '&&' is specific to Windows command line behavior. Additionally, users should exercise caution when executing system-level commands to avoid unintentional modifications or damage to the system.\n\nHere is a basic usage example of how one might invoke this function in a script:\n\n```python\n# Example of executing a single command\nos.system(\"dir\")\n\n# Example of executing multiple commands chained with '&&'\nos.system(\"mkdir new_folder && cd new_folder\")\n```\n\nIn the first example, the function calls `os.system(\"dir\")`, which lists the contents of the current directory.

The calculation is based on three crucial parameters: the distance traveled by the vehicle in that year, the type of fuel the vehicle uses, and the fuel efficiency of the vehicle.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n1. **Distance Traveled**: This parameter represents the total number of miles or kilometers the vehicle has traveled in a year. It is a critical factor, as greater distances typically result in higher emissions.\n\n2. **Fuel Type**: The type of fuel the vehicle uses significantly impacts the calculation. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, electric, and hybrid options. Each fuel type has a specific carbon emissions factor, which denotes the amount of carbon dioxide produced per unit of fuel consumed. This emissions factor is essential for accurately estimating the vehicle's carbon footprint.\n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency**: This represents how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel, usually expressed in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). Higher fuel efficiency indicates that the vehicle can travel further on a smaller amount of fuel, potentially reducing the total emissions.\n\n**Calculation Process:**\n\nThe function combines these parameters to estimate the annual carbon dioxide emissions.

This function leverages available data sources and statistical models to provide an approximation that can assist researchers, conservationists, and policy-makers in understanding the current status of the species in question.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **species_name**: A string representing the common or scientific name of the species for which the population estimate is desired. It is crucial that the name is accurate and corresponds to the recognized nomenclature to ensure the retrieval of relevant data.\n  \n- **country_name**: A string that specifies the name of the country where the population of the species is to be estimated. The country name should match the internationally recognized English spelling to avoid discrepancies in data sourcing.\n\n#### Functionality:\nUpon execution, the function accesses various ecological and environmental databases that track species populations and biodiversity metrics. It applies statistical algorithms that consider factors such as habitat size, known population densities, migration patterns, and any available historical data on population trends and threats, such as habitat loss or climate change impacts. The function may also integrate remote sensing data or citizen science reports to refine its estimates.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- **Data Availability**: In situations where data for a specific species-country combination is sparse or non-existent, the function may return a result with a higher degree of uncertainty. Researchers should be prepared to interpret such outputs with caution.\n  \n- **Species Identification**: Ensuring the correct identification of species is critical. Misidentification can lead to inaccurate estimates and potentially misinform conservation strategies.\n\n- **Country Boundaries**: Political or geographical changes may affect the accuracy of estimates if historical data correspond to different territorial boundaries.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n```python\n# Estimating the population of the African Elephant in Kenya\npopulation_estimate = estimate_species_population(species_name=\"African Elephant\", country_name=\"Kenya\")\nprint(f\"", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"species": {"type": "string", "description": "The species for which population needs to be estimated."}, "country": {"type": "string", "description": "The country where the species lives."}, "year": {"type": "integer", "description": "The year for which population estimate is sought.

Whether the user is in the mood for a comedy, drama, action, thriller, or any other genre, this filter ensures that the movies retrieved align with the specified genre preference.\n\n3. **Cast**: Users can specify one or more actors or actresses to filter movies featuring these cast members. This is particularly useful for fans of specific performers who wish to explore their filmography or discover new works they have participated in.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nSuppose a user wishes to find movies directed by \"Christopher Nolan,\" within the \"Science Fiction\" genre, and starring \"Leonardo DiCaprio.\" By inputting these criteria into the function, the user would receive a list of movies that match all these attributes, such as \"Inception.\" This ensures a highly personalized and relevant movie discovery experience.\n\n#### Considerations:\n- If a user specifies only one or two of the parameters, the function will still retrieve movies based on the available criteria, thereby offering flexibility in how the search is conducted.\n- In cases where no movies match all the criteria provided, the function should ideally return an empty list, indicating that no such films are found within the database or collection being queried.\n\nThis functionality is particularly useful", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": [], "properties": {"directed_by": {"type": "string", "description": "Director of the movie.

The primary purpose of this function is to handle raw fMRI data, which may consist of complex time-series information captured from brain scans, and apply various analytical techniques to extract meaningful insights. \n\n#### Input\n- **fMRI Data**: The function accepts fMRI data, which typically comprises three-dimensional or four-dimensional datasets that represent brain activity over time. This data is usually formatted in standard neuroimaging file formats, such as NIfTI or DICOM. The input may also contain metadata that provides additional context or information necessary for proper analysis.\n\n#### Process\n- The function employs a series of analytical methods to process the input data. These methods may include pre-processing steps such as motion correction, spatial normalization, and temporal filtering. The analysis may also involve statistical techniques to identify patterns of brain activity, connectivity assessments to examine neural networks, or machine learning approaches to classify or predict specific cognitive states or responses.\n\n#### Output\n- **Analyzed Data**: The result of the function is a set of analyzed data that provides insights into the brain's activity patterns. This output can be in the form of statistical maps, graphs representing neural connectivity, or other data visualizations that highlight significant findings. The analyzed data is typically ready for further interpretation by researchers or clinicians.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n- The function should handle cases where the input data is incomplete or contains artifacts that could affect analysis. It should be robust enough to manage variability in data quality and accommodate different scanning protocols or resolutions.\n\n#### Usage Example\n```python\n# Example usage of the function\nraw_fmri_data = load_fmri_data(file_path)\nanalyzed_results = analyze_fmri_data(raw_fmri_data)\ndisplay_results(analyzed_results)\n```\n\nThis function is essential for neuroscientists and researchers who require efficient and accurate", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"data_source": {"type": "string", "description": "The path where the data is stored."}, "sequence_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of fMRI sequence"}, "smooth": {"type": "integer", "description": "Spatial smoothing FWHM.

By leveraging a combination of historical records and databases, the function aims to identify and return relevant data regarding the leader who was prominent or held significant influence in the specified area at the given time.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n- **Location (string):** This parameter represents the geographic area of interest. It should be provided in a format that the function can recognize, such as a city name, country, or region. The accuracy and specificity of the information retrieved will depend on the precision of the location input.\n\n- **Date (string):** This parameter should be a date in a recognizable format (e.g., \"YYYY-MM-DD\"). This date serves as a point of reference to determine which historical leader's information to retrieve. The date should ideally correspond to a time period when the specified location had a clear leader or ruling figure.\n\n#### Functionality\n\nUpon receiving the location and date inputs, the function conducts a search through historical data sources to pinpoint a leader associated with the given parameters. The search considers political, social, and historical contexts to ensure the leader identified is relevant to the time and area specified. The retrieved information typically includes, but is not limited to, the leader's name, title, significant achievements, and a brief overview of their historical impact.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\nSuppose a user wants to retrieve information about a leader in Paris on July 14, 1789. The function would take the inputs as `Location: \"Paris\"` and `Date: \"1789-07-14\"`. It would then return information about a leader such as King Louis XVI, who was the reigning monarch of France during that period, including relevant context about his role during the French Revolution.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n\n- **Ambiguous Locations or Dates:** If the location or date provided is ambiguous or corresponds to a period with multiple leaders or overlapping jurisdictions", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"location": {"type": "string", "description": "The country or region in question."}, "date": {"type": "integer", "description": "The year being queried."}, "title": {"type": "string", "description": "The official title of the position.

It is particularly useful for managers, team leads, or project coordinators who need an overview of the projects their team is currently involved in. The function includes optional parameters that allow users to customize the list according to specific needs, improving the relevance and clarity of the information retrieved.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **team_id**: The unique identifier for the team whose projects are being queried. This parameter is mandatory and serves as the primary filter for the function, ensuring that only projects linked to this specific team are returned.\n\n- **exclude_inactive** (optional): A boolean parameter that, when set to `true`, will exclude any projects that are marked as inactive. This is useful for users who are only interested in active projects that require attention and resources. By default, this parameter is set to `false`, meaning that inactive projects will be included in the results unless this option is explicitly enabled.\n\n- **exclude_child_projects** (optional): Another boolean parameter that allows users to exclude child projects from the list. Child projects are typically those that are part of a larger parent project. Users might choose to exclude these to focus on standalone projects or parent projects. The default value for this parameter is `false`, indicating that child projects will be included unless the user specifies otherwise.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- If the `team_id` provided does not correspond to any existing team, the function may return an empty list or an error message, depending on implementation details.\n\n- When both `exclude_inactive` and `exclude_child_projects` are set to `true`, the resulting list will contain only active, standalone projects associated with the specified team.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose a project manager wants to retrieve a list of all active projects for Team Alpha without any child projects.

The function acts as a crucial fallback mechanism to ensure that users receive the appropriate support and information they need, maintaining a high level of service quality and customer satisfaction.\n\nThe transfer is typically triggered under specific conditions where the automated system's programmed capabilities, knowledge base, or algorithms do not encompass the required information to resolve the user's inquiry. These conditions can include complex questions, unusual or context-specific requests, or instances where the user explicitly requests human assistance.\n\nBy implementing this transfer function, organizations can ensure that users are not left without answers when interacting with automated systems, thereby preventing potential frustration and enhancing the overall user experience. It is essential for the transfer process to be smooth and efficient to minimize disruption to the user's experience. This involves integrating the function with the existing communication platform so that the transition from the virtual assistant to a human agent appears seamless to the user.\n\nThe parameters and configurations for this function may include determining the criteria for triggering the transfer, specifying the communication protocols between the automated system and human agents, and defining how the context of the conversation is handed over to the human agent to ensure continuity in the interaction.

The chord progression serves as the harmonic foundation over which the melody will be composed. The progression should be well-defined and structured to ensure a coherent musical output.\n\n2. **Number of Measures**: This parameter specifies the total length of the melody composition in terms of musical measures or bars. It determines how long the piece will last, with each measure typically consisting of a set number of beats depending on the time signature of the music. The melody will be constructed to fit exactly within this specified duration.\n\n3. **Instrument**: The instrument parameter defines which musical instrument the melody is intended for. It influences the timbre, range, and style of the melody, as different instruments have unique characteristics that affect how a melody is composed and perceived. Common choices include piano, guitar, violin, and flute, among others.\n\nIn executing this function, the user provides these three inputs, and the result is a melody that complements the provided chord progression, fits within the designated number of measures, and is suitable for performance on the specified instrument.

It involves comparing each card in the deck against the desired rank and suit until a match is found. This function is particularly useful in card games and simulations where precise card identification is required.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n1. **rank**: This parameter represents the rank of the card you wish to locate. It can be a string or an integer, depending on how ranks are represented in the deck. For example, ranks could be '2', '3', '4', ..., '10', 'Jack', 'Queen', 'King', 'Ace' if using strings, or the respective numerical equivalents if using integers.\n\n2. **suit**: This parameter stands for the suit of the card you are looking for. It is typically a string value such as 'Hearts', 'Diamonds', 'Clubs', or 'Spades', depending on the standard suits used in the deck.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n- If the deck is empty, the function will immediately return a result indicating that no match could be found, as there are no cards to search through.\n  \n- If multiple cards with the same rank and suit exist in the deck (in cases where decks contain duplicates), this function will return the first occurrence found during its search.\n\n- If the specified rank or suit does not exist in the deck, the function will return a result indicating that the desired card is not present.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\nSuppose you have a deck represented as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains keys for 'rank' and 'suit'.

The function's primary operation is to shuffle these 52 cards into a random order to simulate the process of shuffling a physical deck, ensuring that the sequence of cards is unpredictable.\n\nOnce the deck is thoroughly shuffled, the function proceeds to draw a specified number of cards from the top of this shuffled deck. The number of cards to be drawn is a parameter provided by the user, allowing for flexibility depending on the requirements of the card game being simulated or the operation being performed. The function efficiently handles cases where the specified number of cards to draw is less than or equal to the total number of cards in a standard deck. \n\nIf the draw count exceeds 52, the function will need to handle this gracefully, often by returning the entire deck or signaling an error, as drawing more than 52 cards from a single deck is impossible.

This function is particularly useful in real-world scenarios where terrain features such as hills, mountains, valleys, or bodies of water can significantly alter the distance compared to the simple straight-line, or \"as-the-crow-flies,\" measurement.\n\n### Parameters:\n- **location1**: This parameter represents the starting point or the first location for which the distance calculation is required. It is typically provided in a format that includes geographical coordinates, such as latitude and longitude.\n- **location2**: This parameter is the destination or the second location. Similar to location1, it should be specified using geographical coordinates to ensure precise distance computation.\n\n### Calculation Process:\nThe function utilizes a sophisticated algorithm that incorporates topographical data to adjust the basic distance calculation. This adjustment accounts for elevation changes, natural obstacles, and other terrain features that might impact travel distance. For example, if the path between the two locations includes a steep hill, the algorithm will factor in the additional effort required to traverse this terrain, resulting in a longer calculated distance than the straight-line measurement.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- **Flat Terrain**: If the terrain between the two locations is completely flat, the calculated distance will closely resemble the straight-line distance, as there are no additional terrain-based adjustments necessary.\n- **Unusual Terrain**: In cases where the terrain includes extremely unusual features (such as a very high mountain or a deep canyon), the function may require additional data or assumptions to accurately estimate the distance.\n- **Non-Traversable Terrain**: For areas marked as impossible to traverse (such as certain bodies of water without ferries or bridges), the function needs to incorporate known routes around these obstacles.\n\n### Example Usage:\nHere's an example of how this function might be used in a real-world application:\n\n```python\n# Given coordinates for location1 and location2\nlocation1 = (34.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"origin": {"type": "string", "description": "Starting location of the distance measurement."}, "destination": {"type": "string", "description": "Destination location of the distance measurement."}, "consider_terrain": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether to account for terrain in distance calculation, defaults to false."}}, "required": ["origin", "destination"]}}, {"name": "distance_calculator.calculate2", "description": "Calculate the distance between two locations, considering terrain.Example: distance_calculator.calculate(origin=\"New York\", destination=\"Los Angeles\", consider_terrain=True)\n\nExample: distance_calculator.calculate(origin=\"Paris\", destination=\"Berlin\", consider_terrain=False)\n\nExample: distance_calculator.calculate(origin=\"Tokyo\", destination=\"Kyoto\")", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"origin": {"type": "string", "description": "Starting location of the distance measurement."}, "destination": {"type": "string", "description": "Destination location of the distance measurement."}, "consider_terrain": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether to account for terrain in distance calculation, defaults to false."}}, "required": ["origin", "destination"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\ndistance_calculator.calculate1(location1=\"New York\", location2=\"Boston\", consider_terrain=True)", "model_result_decoded": [{"distance_calculator.calculate1": {"location1": "New York", "location2": "Boston", "consider_terrain": true}}], "possible_answer": [{"distance_calculator.calculate1": {"origin": ["New York", "New York City", "New York City, NY", "New York, NY", "NYC"], "destination": ["Boston"], "consider_terrain": [true]}}, {"distance_calculator.calculate2": {"origin": ["New York", "New York City", "New York City, NY", "New York, NY", "NYC"], "destination": ["Boston"], "consider_terrain": [true]}}, {"distance_calculator.calculate3": {"origin": ["New York", "New York City", "New York City, NY", "New York, NY", "NYC"], "destination": ["Boston"], "consider_terrain": [true]}}]}
