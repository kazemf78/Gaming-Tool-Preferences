It takes an input that specifies the food item the customer desires to select. The critical aspect of this function is its adherence to a specific requirement: the name of the food item provided by the customer must be in uppercase letters. This ensures consistency and prevents errors that could arise from case sensitivity in processing food item names.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\n- **Input Requirement:** The function expects the food item name to be passed as a string. It is crucial that this string is entirely in uppercase letters. For example, if a customer wants to select \"pasta,\" the input should be \"PASTA\" instead of \"pasta\" or \"Pasta.\" This requirement is in place to maintain uniformity in how food items are recorded and processed within the system.\n\n- **Selection Process:** Upon receiving the request, the function checks the provided food name against a predefined list of available food items. It confirms that the requested food item exists in the list and then updates the current selection to reflect the customer's choice. The function will only successfully execute if the food name matches an item in the list exactly, taking into account the uppercase requirement.\n\n- **Error Handling:** If the food name is not supplied in uppercase or does not match any item in the available food list, the function will not proceed with changing the selection. Instead, it will typically return an error message or code indicating the nature of the issue, such as \"Invalid food item name\" or \"Food item not found.\" This helps guide users to correct the input and resubmit their requests appropriately.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose a customer wants to change their selection to a salad. The function call should look like this:\n\n```plaintext\nchangeFoodSelection(\"SALAD\")\n```\n\nIn this scenario, \"SALAD\" is the correct input because it adheres to the uppercase requirement.

Its primary purpose is to parse the generated answer to determine its validity and appropriateness for the given context. The parsing process involves analyzing the structured output from the LLM to ensure it meets certain criteria or expected patterns.\n\nA critical feature of this function is its ability to handle specific cases where the LLM may not be able to provide a suitable answer. In situations where the LLM output explicitly includes the phrase 'answer not found', the function will identify this as an indication of an invalid or unsuccessful result. Consequently, it will return an empty string to signify that no valid answer was generated.\n\nThis behavior is particularly useful in applications where the presence of 'answer not found' in the LLM output needs to be clearly distinguished from other types of valid responses. By returning an empty string, the function allows the calling code to easily check for this specific case and take appropriate action, such as prompting for additional input or logging an error.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `llm_output`: A string representing the raw output generated by the Language Learning Model.

Similarly, if pressure is involved, the same unit should be used for both initial and final conditions, such as Pascals or atmospheres.\n\nThis calculation is crucial in processes where energy transformations occur, allowing for a better understanding of the energy efficiency and feasibility of a process.

Such processes are fundamental concepts in thermodynamics, often used in the analysis of idealized systems.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **Q**: The heat exchanged during the process, typically measured in joules (J). This parameter is crucial since, for an isothermal process, the entropy change is directly related to the heat transfer.\n- **T**: The absolute temperature at which the process occurs, measured in Kelvin (K). The temperature must remain constant throughout the process for the calculations to be valid. It is critical to ensure the temperature is given in Kelvin, as this is the standard unit in thermodynamics calculations.\n\n#### Details:\nIn the context of an isothermal and reversible process, the change in entropy (\\(\\Delta S\\)) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta S = \\frac{Q}{T}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\Delta S\\) is the change in entropy,\n- \\(Q\\) is the heat absorbed by the system,\n- \\(T\\) is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe function assumes that the process is carried out reversibly, which implies that the system remains in thermodynamic equilibrium throughout the process. This is an idealization that allows for the calculation of entropy changes without additional entropy generation, which would occur in irreversible processes.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- **Zero Heat Exchange**: If \\(Q = 0\\), the entropy change \\(\\Delta S\\) will be zero, indicating no change in the system's disorder.\n- **Negative Heat Exchange**: If the system releases heat (i.e., \\(Q\\) is negative), the entropy change will be negative, signifying a decrease in the system's entropy.\n\n#### Example Usage:\nImagine a scenario where a system absorbs 500 J of heat at a constant temperature of", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"initial_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial temperature in Kelvin."}, "final_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The final temperature in Kelvin."}, "heat_capacity": {"type": "integer", "description": "The heat capacity in J/K."}, "isothermal": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether the process is isothermal.

The coefficient of determination is a statistical measure that helps to assess the goodness of fit of the model. It represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. This metric is crucial for evaluating how well the model captures the observed data's variability.\n\nThe function typically requires two main sets of inputs: the observed values of the dependent variable and the predicted values generated by the regression model. These inputs allow the function to quantify how closely the predicted data approximates the actual data. The R-squared value ranges from 0 to 1, where a value of 0 indicates that the model fails to explain any of the variability, while a value of 1 suggests that the model perfectly fits the data.\n\nAn important aspect to note is that a higher R-squared value does not necessarily mean the model is the best choice. It is possible for a model with a high R-squared to lack predictive power or to be overfitting the data. Therefore, while the R-squared is a useful indicator of model performance, it should be used in conjunction with other diagnostic measures.\n\nExample usage of this function might involve passing an array or list of actual values and predicted values to the function, which then returns the calculated R-squared value.

It is typically provided as a decimal, where a 5% return would be input as 0.05. The yield rate is crucial as it directly influences the growth of the investment over time.\n\n2. **Investment Amount**: This is the initial sum of money that is invested in the mutual fund. It represents the principal amount upon which the returns will be calculated. The investment amount is essential for determining the scale of the potential returns, with larger investments leading to proportionately higher estimated returns, assuming the same yield rate and time period.\n\n3. **Time Period**: This parameter specifies the duration, usually in years, for which the investment is held in the mutual fund. The time period impacts the compounding effect, where longer durations typically result in greater overall returns due to the exponential growth facilitated by compounding interest.\n\nThe calculation process assumes the concept of compound interest, where the returns are reinvested and generate their own returns over time. This means that each year, the mutual fund's yield is applied not only to the original investment amount but also to the accumulated returns from previous years.\n\nFor example, if an investor puts $10,000 into a mutual fund with an annual yield of 7% for 5 years, the function will estimate the future value of this investment by applying the compound interest formula. It multiplies the original investment by the compound factor, which is calculated using the formula \\( (1 + \\text{yearly yield})^{\\text{time period}} \\).

The `os.system(\"cd C:\\\\ && dir\")` command changes the directory to the C: drive and lists its contents. Lastly, running `os.system(\"task.bat\")` will execute the batch file named `task.bat`, which can contain multiple complex commands. Remember, the use of `os.system", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The Windows command line instruction(s) to be executed.

By leveraging Twitter's vast social network, the function isolates users who are influential or active within particular domains of interest.\n\n#### Detailed Explanation:\n\n- **Purpose**: The primary objective of this function is to assist users in pinpointing the most popular or influential individual on Twitter connected to certain thematic areas. This is particularly useful for researchers, marketers, or enthusiasts who want to engage with or analyze leading figures in specific fields.\n\n- **Functionality**: \n  - The function scans Twitter profiles and their associated metadata to determine relevance to the given topics. It then calculates follower counts for each relevant user and identifies the user with the maximum number.\n  - This process involves filtering users based on their bios, tweet content, hashtags, or other topic-related signals.\n\n- **Edge Cases**:\n  - If multiple users have the same number of followers, the function may either return one of them or prioritize based on additional criteria such as engagement metrics or recency of activity.\n  - In the event that no users clearly associated with the specified topics are found, the function should handle this gracefully, possibly returning a null value or a message indicating no relevant users were identified.\n\n- **Usage Example**:\n  - Suppose you are interested in finding the most followed user related to the topic of \"sustainable energy\". You would input \"sustainable energy\" as the topic, and the function would output the Twitter handle of the user with the highest follower count who is active or influential in the sustainable energy conversation.\n\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `topics` (string or list of strings): The specific topics for which the user wants to find the most followed Twitter user. This can be a single topic or a list of multiple topics.\n\nBy using this function, users can efficiently zero in on key influencers within specific topical areas on Twitter, thereby facilitating targeted engagement or analysis", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"topic": {"type": "string", "description": "The main topic of interest."}, "sub_topics": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "Sub-topics related to main topic.

A full house is a poker hand that consists of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. For instance, a hand containing three Kings and two Aces qualifies as a full house, symbolically represented as K-K-K-A-A.\n\n#### Details\n\n1. **Deck Composition**: The calculation accounts for a standard deck of 52 playing cards, which includes four suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades), and each suit contains 13 ranks ranging from Ace through King.\n\n2. **Hand Composition**: In poker, a player is typically dealt 5 cards. The full house probability calculation focuses on this hand size, examining all possible combinations that can result in a full house.\n\n3. **Combinatorial Calculation**:\n   - **Choosing Ranks**: The first step involves selecting a rank for the triplet (three of a kind). There are 13 possible ranks in the deck, each contributing to potential full house combinations.\n   - **Selecting Triplets**: For the chosen rank for the triplet, any three of the four available suits can form the triplet, calculated using the combination formula \\(\\binom{4}{3}\\).\n   - **Choosing Pairs**: After selecting the triplet rank, the calculation chooses a different rank for the pair. There are 12 remaining ranks available for this selection.\n   - **Selecting Pairs from Ranks**: For the rank chosen for the pair, any two of the four available suits can form the pair, determined by the combination formula \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\n4. **Total Calculation**: The above choices are combined to calculate the total number of different full house hands possible using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Full Houses} = 13 \\times \\", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"deck_size": {"type": "integer", "description": "The size of the deck.
