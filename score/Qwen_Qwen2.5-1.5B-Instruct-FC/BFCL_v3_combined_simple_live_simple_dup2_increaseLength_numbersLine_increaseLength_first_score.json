To perform this computation, the function takes as input a mathematical function, typically expressed in terms of a variable, along with a defined interval [a, b] within which the area is to be calculated.\n\nThe interval is specified by its lower bound 'a' and upper bound 'b', both of which are real numbers.

Additionally, if the interval is specified such that a > b, this might lead to an interpretation where the area is computed in the reverse direction, which typically results in a negative area value according to the convention of definite integration.\n\nFor usage, consider a simple example where you want to calculate the area under the curve of f(x) = x^2 from x = 1 to x = 3. You would input the function f(x) = x^2 and the interval [1, 3] into the area calculation function.

Prime factors are the set of prime numbers that multiply together to represent the original number. The function systematically breaks down the input number into its constituent prime components.\n\n#### Parameters\n- **number (int)**: A positive integer for which the function will determine the prime factors. The input should be greater than 1, as numbers less than 2 do not have prime factors.\n\n#### Returns\n- **List[int]**: A list containing the prime factors of the provided number. Each prime factor appears in the list as many times as it is used in the multiplication to achieve the original number.

It operates under the assumption that these two physiological metrics can provide significant insights into a person's health profile, particularly in relation to their risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **weight (float or int):** This parameter represents the individual's weight, typically measured in kilograms or pounds. Accurate weight measurement is crucial as it directly influences the calculation of body mass index (BMI), which is a commonly used proxy for assessing overweight and obesity levels. These levels are known risk factors for type 2 diabetes.\n\n- **height (float or int):** This parameter denotes the individual's height, usually recorded in meters or inches. Height is another essential component for calculating BMI. Accurate height measurement ensures the correct interpretation of BMI, which is vital for the assessment of diabetes risk.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\nThe function processes the input values to calculate the individual's BMI, which is a widely recognized metric for evaluating body fat. The BMI is computed using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{BMI} = \\frac{\\text{weight in kilograms}}{(\\text{height in meters})^2} \\]\n\nor\n\n\\[ \\text{BMI} = \\frac{\\text{weight in pounds}}{(\\text{height in inches})^2} \\times 703 \\]\n\nOnce the BMI is calculated, the function uses this value as a core determinant to predict the probability of type 2 diabetes. The function may implement predictive algorithms or reference medical data that correlate BMI ranges with diabetes risk levels.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n1. **Unrealistic Weight or Height Values:** If the provided weight or height is zero or negative, the function should handle these cases gracefully, possibly by returning an error message or requesting valid inputs.\n\n2. **Extremely High or Low BMI:** For individuals with very high or very", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"weight": {"type": "integer", "description": "Weight of the person in lbs."}, "height": {"type": "integer", "description": "Height of the person in inches."}, "activity_level": {"type": "string", "enum": ["sedentary", "lightly active", "moderately active", "very active", "extra active"], "description": "Physical activity level of the person."}}, "required": ["weight", "height", "activity_level"]}}, {"name": "diabetes_prediction2", "description": "Predict the likelihood of diabetes type 2 based on a person's weight and height.

These inputs are essential for performing the calculation. The formula used by the function to determine population density is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Population Density} = \\frac{\\text{Total Population}}{\\text{Land Area}} \\]\n\nwhere \"Total Population\" represents the number of people residing in the country during the specified year, and \"Land Area\" is the size of the country's territory, measured in square kilometers or square miles. \n\nThis function is particularly useful for demographic studies, urban planning, and resource allocation, providing insights into how populated a country is relative to its land size.

By specifying the frequency, users can determine how many oscillations or cycles occur per unit of time or space. The range defines the interval over which the sine wave is plotted, allowing users to visualize how the wave varies over that specific section of the domain. \n\nFor instance, if a user wants to examine a sine wave that oscillates at a frequency of 5 Hz (hertz), they would set the frequency parameter to 5. Additionally, if the user wishes to see the behavior of this wave from time 0 to 10 seconds, they would define the range parameter accordingly.

Light, the fastest known entity in the universe, travels at approximately 299,792 kilometers per second in a vacuum. The function leverages this constant speed of light to determine the time interval required for light to traverse the distance separating the two specified celestial bodies.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **distance (float)**: This parameter represents the distance between the two celestial bodies, expressed in kilometers. It is crucial that the distance provided is accurate to ensure the precision of the calculated time. The function assumes that the entire distance is a straight line in a vacuum, as light speed can be affected by varying mediums.\n\n2. **speed_of_light (constant)**: The speed of light is a fundamental constant used in the calculation. Although this value is fixed at approximately 299,792 kilometers per second, it is implicitly considered in the calculation and does not need to be provided as an argument by the user. \n\n#### Returns:\n\n- **time (float)**: The function returns the time taken for light to travel the specified distance. The returned value is presented in seconds, providing a clear measurement of the time lapse due to the immense speed of light.\n\n#### Edge Cases and Considerations:\n\n- **Zero Distance**: If the distance between the two celestial bodies is zero, the function should return a time of zero seconds, indicating that no travel is necessary.\n- **Negative Distance**: Theoretically, a negative distance does not have a physical meaning in this context. The function should handle such inputs by either returning an error or processing it as an invalid request.\n- **Extremely Large Distances**: For astronomical distances, the function should maintain precision and accuracy, considering the vast scales involved in space. The result may require significant digits to accurately reflect the time taken.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\n```python\n# Example call to calculate light travel time\ndistance_between", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"distance_in_light_years": {"type": "integer", "description": "The distance between the two celestial bodies in light years."}, "speed_of_light": {"type": "integer", "description": "The speed of light in vacuum, in m/s.

The primary objective is to ensure that each query received is systematically assigned to its corresponding category, allowing for efficient management, analysis, and retrieval of information. The function plays a crucial role in maintaining an organized system of query classifications, which can be instrumental for further processing, reporting, and fulfilling banking operational requirements.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **query_id**: A unique identifier for each query that is to be recorded. This ensures that each query can be distinctly recognized and tracked.\n- **query_content**: The actual content or body of the query. This is the text or message that describes the banking-related issue or request.\n- **category**: A predefined list or system of categories under which the query will be classified. Categories might include loan inquiries, transaction disputes, account management, fraud alerts, etc.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- The function should handle scenarios where a query does not clearly fit into any defined category, potentially by assigning it to a default or miscellaneous category or flagging it for manual review.\n- It must also address queries that could belong to multiple categories by applying predefined rules for prioritization or categorization to ensure consistency.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nTo illustrate the function's application, consider a scenario where a customer submits a query about a potential credit card fraud. The function would:\n- Receive the unique query_id to track this particular correspondence.\n- Extract and analyze the query_content to determine the nature of the issue.\n- Classify this query under the 'Fraud Alerts' category based on the content analysis.\n\nBy recording the categories of banking-related queries, this function enhances the efficiency of customer service operations, supports data-driven insights, and contributes to improved service delivery in the banking sector.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["faq_describe_telephone_banking_start", "bank_hours_start", "faq_describe_accounts_start"], "properties": {"faq_describe_telephone_banking_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "An array of strings containing queries about starting or signing up for telephone banking services."}, "bank_hours_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "An array of strings containing queries regarding the working hours or locations of bank branches."}, "faq_describe_accounts_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "An array of strings containing queries about descriptions of different types of bank accounts."}}}}, {"name": "record2", "description": "Records the categories to which various banking-related queries are classified.

To achieve this, the function utilizes a pre-trained question-answering model from the Hugging Face Transformers library, which is a popular collection of state-of-the-art machine learning models designed for natural language processing tasks.\n\nWhen invoking this function, users must supply an image file, which should be in a compatible format such as JPEG, PNG, or another common image file type. The image is processed to extract relevant visual information that can assist in answering the question accurately. The other required input is a text-based question, typically in the form of a string, that pertains to the content depicted in the image.\n\nThe function leverages the capabilities of the pre-trained model, which has been fine-tuned on extensive datasets to understand various types of questions and generate contextually appropriate responses. By using the transformers library, the function can efficiently handle the natural language understanding component of the task, which involves interpreting the question and mapping it to the visual elements detected in the image.\n\nAn edge case to consider is the clarity and relevance of the question in relation to the image. The model's ability to provide a precise answer heavily depends on the specificity and correctness of the question. Additionally, the image must contain discernible features that the model can analyze to produce a meaningful answer.\n\nAs an example, if the image is a photograph of a beach, and the question is, \"What color is the ocean?\" the function would process both inputs to provide an answer such as \"The ocean is blue.\" However, if the question is unrelated or ambiguous, such as \"What is happening here?\" without clear context, the function may struggle to generate an appropriate response.\n\nOverall, this function is an integration of image processing and language understanding, harnessing the power of advanced machine learning techniques to deliver practical and insightful answers", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["image_path", "question", "model"], "properties": {"image_path": {"type": "string", "description": "The file path to the image on which the question is based, in the format of 'folder/subfolder/image.png'."}, "question": {"type": "string", "description": "The question to be answered, related to the content of the provided image."}, "model": {"type": "any", "description": "The pre-loaded question-answering model from the Hugging Face Transformers library used to answer the question."}}}}, {"name": "process_data2", "description": "Processes an image and a question to provide an answer using a pre-trained question-answering model from the Hugging Face Transformers library.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.This function is designed to execute system-level commands specifically on Windows operating systems by utilizing the `os.system()` function from Python's `os` module. The `os.system()` function allows users to issue commands to the underlying operating system, facilitating tasks such as running executables, managing files and directories, or querying system information directly from a Python script.\n\nThe function is capable of executing not just a single command, but also multiple commands that are chained together. Command chaining is achieved by using the '&&' operator, a logical AND operator in shell scripting, which ensures that each subsequent command is executed only if the preceding command succeeds without errors.\n\nFor instance, if you issue a command such as `os.system(\"command1 && command2 && command3\")`, the system will execute `command1` first. If `command1` executes successfully (returns a zero exit status), then `command2` will be executed next. Similarly, if `command2` is successful, `command3` will then be executed. If any command fails, the subsequent commands in the chain will not be executed.\n\nThis chaining feature is particularly useful for complex operations where the success of a sequence of commands is interdependent, allowing for conditional execution based on the outcome of previous commands.\n\nWhen using `os.system()`, it is important to note that it does not capture output from the executed commands. It simply executes the commands and returns the exit status. For capturing output, one would need to use other functions like `subprocess.run()` or `subprocess.Popen()`.\n\nOverall, this function provides a convenient interface for executing Windows shell commands from within Python, offering flexibility through command chaining and conditional execution.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

It is an essential factor because the amount of CO2 emissions is directly proportional to how far the vehicle travels. The greater the distance, the more emissions are expected, provided other factors remain constant.\n\n2. **Fuel Type:** This refers to the kind of fuel the vehicle uses, such as gasoline, diesel, or alternative fuels like ethanol or natural gas.

For instance, gasoline and diesel have different emission factors, affecting the total CO2 emissions calculated.\n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency:** This parameter indicates how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel to travel a given distance, typically stated in terms of liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km) or miles per gallon (mpg). Higher fuel efficiency means that the vehicle consumes less fuel for the same distance, resulting in lower CO2 emissions. Conversely, lower efficiency leads to higher emissions.\n\nThe function combines these parameters to estimate the total CO2 emissions for the year. It considers how the interplay between the distance traveled, the fuel type used, and the vehicle's fuel efficiency impacts the overall emissions output. For instance, even if a vehicle travels a substantial distance, if it uses a fuel with a low carbon content or has high fuel efficiency, the emissions might remain relatively low. Conversely, a vehicle with poor fuel efficiency using a high-carbon fuel type will likely produce higher emissions over the same distance.\n\nIn summary, this function provides a crucial environmental metric by allowing individuals, organizations,", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"distance": {"type": "integer", "description": "The distance travelled in miles."}, "fuel_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of fuel used by the vehicle."}, "fuel_efficiency": {"type": "float", "description": "The vehicle's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon."}, "efficiency_reduction": {"type": "integer", "description": "The percentage decrease in fuel efficiency per year (optional).

The calculation focuses on determining the amount of emissions that could be avoided by making this energy transition, thereby contributing to environmental sustainability efforts.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- **current_emissions (float):** This parameter represents the amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced by the current energy source over a specific period, typically measured in tons of CO2-equivalent gases. It serves as the baseline from which potential savings are calculated.\n\n- **renewable_emissions (float):** This parameter indicates the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the renewable energy source selected for comparison. Although renewable sources generally produce significantly lower emissions, this parameter accounts for any emissions that might occur during manufacturing, installation, or maintenance of renewable energy systems.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- **emissions_saved (float):** The function returns a floating-point number that quantifies the potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. It is calculated by subtracting the emissions produced by the renewable energy source from those produced by the current energy source.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\nConsider a scenario where a coal-powered plant emits 10,000 tons of CO2-equivalent gases annually. By switching to a solar power system that generates 500 tons of emissions per year, the function can be used to compute the emissions saved with the following invocation:\n\n```python\nemissions_saved = calculate_emissions_saved(10000, 500)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `emissions_saved` will be 9,500 tons, representing the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions achieved by the transition.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\nThe function should handle situations where the emissions from the renewable source are equal to or greater than those from the current source.

This could be a city name, a postal code, a GPS coordinate, or any identifiable location format that the function can interpret to search for events happening within that area.\n\n### Functionality\n\nUpon execution, the function performs a search operation across an event database or API, identifying events that are scheduled to happen in the future. It filters these events based on the provided genre and location parameters. The function then compiles a list of upcoming events that meet both criteria, which is returned to the user. This enables users to plan their schedules around events that they are interested in and are accessible to them geographically.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- If no events match the specified genre in the given location, the function should return an empty list or appropriate message indicating that no upcoming events are available based on the search criteria.\n  \n- The function should handle cases where either the genre or location is unspecified or invalid by returning an error or prompting the user to provide valid input.\n\n### Usage Example\n\n```python\n# Example usage of the function\nupcoming_events = find_upcoming_events(genre=\"Jazz\", location=\"New York City", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"location": {"type": "string", "description": "The city and state where the search will take place, e.g. New York, NY."}, "genre": {"type": "string", "description": "The genre of events."}, "days_ahead": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of days from now to include in the search.", "default": 7}}, "required": ["location", "genre"]}}, {"name": "event_finder.find_upcoming2", "description": "Find upcoming events of a specific genre in a given location.

This function is particularly useful for musicians, composers, and music theorists who need to understand harmonic structures or create chord progressions. \n\nWhen you provide the function with a key, it analyzes the notes that comprise that key's scale. The function then identifies the third chord, counting from the tonic, which is constructed using the major scale pattern. It\u2019s important to note that in Western music theory, a major chord is typically built using the first (root), third, and fifth notes of the scale. This function specifically targets the third position major chord within the sequence of triads that can be derived from the given key.\n\nFor instance, if the given key is C major, the function will calculate the third major chord in this key. In the C major scale (C, D, E, F, G, A, B), the third chord is E minor when considering the diatonic triads, but if the focus is solely on major chords, it will identify the next major chord after C major and G major, which does not exist in the basic major scale triads of C major.\n\nIn terms of usage, the function typically requires input specifying the desired key. This key can be represented in various forms, such as a string indicating the key signature (e.g., \"C major\" or \"G# major\"). The result is the name of the major chord that is third in the sequence of major chords possible in that key, or an indication that only two major chords are typically present within a diatonic major scale before repeating the cycle.\n\nThis function is highly relevant in music education and the development of software applications that analyze or generate music.

A full house is a hand that contains three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank, such as three queens and two eights. In a standard deck of 52 playing cards, this is considered one of the stronger hands a player can have.\n\n#### Features and Details:\n\n- **Input Parameters:** The function typically does not require input parameters, as it operates on the assumption of a standard 52-card deck used in typical poker games.\n  \n- **Output:** The output is a numerical probability value, representing the likelihood of being dealt a full house. This value ranges between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating certainty. The probability is calculated by considering all possible five-card combinations that form a full house and dividing by the total number of possible five-card hands.\n\n- **Calculation Methodology:** \n  - The method involves combinatorial mathematics to determine the number of successful outcomes (i.e., the number of ways to form a full house) divided by the total number of possible five-card hands from a deck. \n  - Specifically, it calculates the combinations of choosing three cards of the same rank from four available in the deck, and two cards of another rank from the remaining four cards of that rank.\n\n- **Edge Cases:** \n  - The function assumes a perfect shuffle and no prior card removal, reflecting a fresh and complete deck.\n  - It does not account for multiple decks or jokers, as it is based on the standard poker rules using a single deck.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nThe function can be used in poker simulation games, strategy analysis, or as part of a larger poker hand evaluation library.

To achieve its purpose, the function requires three key parameters:\n\n1. **City**: This parameter specifies the geographical location in which the user is interested. It should be provided as a string representing the name of the city. The function utilizes this input to narrow down the search to sushi places within the specified city. It is important to ensure that the city name is spelled correctly and is recognized by the system's database for accurate results.\n\n2. **Review Rate**: This parameter indicates the threshold for customer satisfaction ratings that must be met or exceeded for a sushi place to be considered. It is typically represented as a numerical value, often on a scale from 1 to 5, with higher numbers indicating better reviews. This criterion ensures that only sushi places with a satisfactory level of customer feedback are included in the results.
