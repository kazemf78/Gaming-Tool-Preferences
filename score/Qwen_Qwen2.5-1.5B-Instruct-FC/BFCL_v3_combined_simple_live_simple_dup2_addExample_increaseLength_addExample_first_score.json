For instance, if you input \"San Francisco\" as the city and \"CA\" as the state, it will return the current weather conditions specific to San Francisco, California. \n\nIt is important to note that using the correct abbreviation for the state is crucial for the function to perform accurately. For example, if you are looking to get weather information for New York, you would use \"NY\" as the state abbreviation. This ensures that the function can correctly identify the geographic location and provide the accurate weather conditions for that area.\n\nEdge cases may include situations where the name of the city is shared by multiple locations (for example, Springfield, which exists in several states). In such instances, ensuring the correct state abbreviation is even more critical to retrieve the correct weather data. Additionally, the function assumes that the city name and state abbreviation adhere to standard spelling and formatting conventions to effectively query the weather service. \n\nThis function is an invaluable tool for those seeking real-time weather updates, providing them with necessary information to make informed decisions, whether they are planning an outdoor event, preparing for travel, or simply curious about the current weather in a different part of the country.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["location"], "properties": {"location": {"type": "string", "description": "The location for which to get the weather, in the format of 'City, State (abbr)', such as 'San Francisco, CA' if State for the city exists.

In thermodynamics, entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness in a system, and understanding changes in entropy is crucial for analyzing energy exchanges in various physical and chemical processes.\n\nFor an isothermal process, the temperature remains constant throughout the entire process. This condition is significant because it allows simplifications in the calculation of entropy. The function assumes that the system is in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings, maintaining a constant temperature.\n\nIn addition to being isothermal, the process is also reversible. A reversible process is an idealized concept in thermodynamics where the system changes in such a way that both the system and its surroundings can be returned to their original states with no net change. Reversible processes are an important theoretical model because they represent the maximum efficiency with which energy can be converted or transferred.\n\nTo calculate the entropy change, the function uses the formula:\n\n\\[ \\Delta S = \\frac{Q_{\\text{rev}}}{T} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\Delta S \\) is the change in entropy.\n- \\( Q_{\\text{rev}} \\) is the amount of heat absorbed or released by the system during the reversible process.\n- \\( T \\) is the absolute temperature at which the process occurs.\n\nThis formula highlights the direct relationship between the heat exchanged and entropy change for a reversible process: the greater the amount of heat exchanged at a given temperature, the greater the change in entropy.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\nConsider a system where 500 J of heat is absorbed from a reservoir at a constant temperature of 300 K. The entropy change for this reversible and isothermal process would be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\Delta S = \\frac{500 \\, \\text{J}}{300 \\, \\text{K}} = 1.67 \\, \\text{J/K} \\]\n\nThis result indicates the increase in the system's entropy due to the", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"initial_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial temperature in Kelvin."}, "final_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The final temperature in Kelvin."}, "heat_capacity": {"type": "integer", "description": "The heat capacity in J/K."}, "isothermal": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether the process is isothermal.

Typically, a boolean or string value (e.g., 'asc' for ascending or 'desc' for descending) that dictates whether the sorting should be in ascending or descending order.\n\nIn summary, this function provides a flexible and robust solution for sorting lists according", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"list": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "float"}, "description": "The list of numbers to be sorted."}, "order": {"type": "string", "enum": ["ascending", "descending"], "description": "Order of sorting."}}, "required": ["list", "order"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"array_sort1": {"list": [5, 3, 4, 1, 2], "order": "ascending"}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"array_sort1": {"list": [5, 3, 4, 1, 2], "order": "ascending"}}], "possible_answer": [{"array_sort1": {"list": [[5.0, 3.0, 4.0, 1.0, 2.0]], "order": ["ascending"]}}, {"array_sort2": {"list": [[5.0, 3.0, 4.0, 1.0, 2.0]], "order": ["ascending"]}}, {"array_sort3": {"list": [[5.0, 3.0, 4.0, 1.0, 2.0]], "order": ["ascending"]}}]}

It performs two critical tasks: normalization of numerical values and encoding of categorical variables. \n\nFirstly, normalization involves scaling the numerical values within the dataset to a specific range, typically between 0 and 1, or transforming them to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This step is crucial as it ensures that all numerical features contribute equally to the model's learning process, preventing any single feature from having an undue influence due to its scale.\n\nSecondly, the function handles the encoding of categorical variables, which are non-numeric data types that represent categories or labels. Encoding can be done using various techniques, such as one-hot encoding or label encoding. One-hot encoding transforms each category into a new binary column, ensuring that machine learning models can interpret these variables correctly. Label encoding replaces each category with a unique integer, which is suitable for algorithms that can naturally handle categorical data.\n\nBy performing these preprocessing steps, the function ensures that the dataset is in an optimal format for training machine learning models.

Additionally, users must ensure that each query string is correctly formatted and relevant to the associated intent to maintain the integrity of the classification process. \n\nIn practice, this function is useful for applications in natural language processing, customer service automation, and analytics, where accurately classifying queries helps in responding appropriately based on the user's intent.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": [], "properties": {"acc_routing_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries requesting bank routing numbers or account numbers.", "default": []}, "atm_finder_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries asking for ATM locations or to urgently find an ATM for cash withdrawal.", "default": []}, "faq_link_accounts_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries related to linking accounts within the bank's system.", "default": []}, "get_balance_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries requesting account balances, available funds, or other financial balances.", "default": []}, "get_transactions_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries related to viewing transaction details including deposits and purchases.", "default": []}, "outofscope": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries that do not classify under any of the other available intents.", "default": []}}}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"record1": {"get_balance_start": ["What is my balance?", "Tell me my available balance, please", "What is my current available balance?", "Where is the closest ATM to my current location?", "Find ATM for immediate cash needs", "Please provide my current account balance", "Show me my balance information.", "What is the balance in my account at this moment?", "How much money is in my account?"]}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"record1": {"get_balance_start": ["What is my balance?", "Tell me my available balance, please", "What is my current available balance?", "Where is the closest ATM to my current location?", "Find ATM for immediate cash needs", "Please provide my current account balance", "Show me my balance information.", "What is the balance in my account at this moment?", "How much money is in my account?"]}}], "possible_answer": [{"record1": {"acc_routing_start": ["", []], "atm_finder_start": [["Where is the closest ATM to my current location?", "Find ATM for immediate cash needs"]], "faq_link_accounts_start": ["", []], "get_balance_start": [["What is my balance?", "Tell me my available balance, please", "What is my current available balance?", "Please provide my current account balance", "Show me my balance information.", "What is the balance in my account at this moment?", "How much money is in my account?", "Tell me my available balance"]], "get_transactions_start": ["", []], "outofscope": ["", []]}}, {"record2": {"acc_routing_start": ["", []], "atm_finder_start": [["Where is the closest ATM to my current location?", "Find ATM for immediate cash needs"]], "faq_link_accounts_start": ["", []], "get_balance_start": [["What is my balance?", "Tell me my available balance, please", "What is my current available balance?", "Please provide my current account balance", "Show me my balance information.", "What is the balance in my account at this moment?", "How much money is in my account?", "Tell me my available balance"]], "get_transactions_start": ["", []], "outofscope": ["", []]}}, {"record3": {"acc_routing_start": ["", []], "atm_finder_start": [["Where is the closest ATM to my current location?", "Find ATM for immediate cash needs"]], "faq_link_accounts_start": ["", []], "get_balance_start": [["What is my balance?", "Tell me my available balance, please", "What is my current available balance?", "Please provide my current account balance", "Show me my balance information.", "What is the balance in my account at this moment?", "How much money is in my account?", "Tell me my available balance"]], "get_transactions_start": ["", []], "outofscope": ["", []]}}]}

Allows for the bulk recording of query classifications in one function call.This function is designed to efficiently manage and record the classification of a large number of queries by associating them with specific intent names. It achieves this by leveraging keyword arguments, where each keyword corresponds to an intent name, and the associated value is a collection of queries that share this intent. By using this approach, users can perform bulk recordings of query classifications in a single function call, significantly streamlining the process.\n\n### Parameters\n\n- **intent_name**: Keyword arguments where each keyword represents the name of an intent. This acts as a label that describes the purpose or goal of the queries associated with it.\n\n- **queries**: The values that accompany each intent name keyword argument. These are the actual queries that need to be classified. They can be provided in various iterable forms, such as lists or tuples, allowing for flexibility in input data structures.\n\n### Functionality\n\nWhen you call this function, it processes each keyword argument, taking the name of the keyword as the intent and the corresponding value as the list of queries. The function then records the association between each query and its intent, effectively classifying them in bulk. This method is particularly useful for applications that require organizing a large number of queries systematically, such as natural language processing tasks, chatbots, or automated customer service systems.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- If no queries are provided for a given intent, the function will simply record the intent with an empty list of queries, ensuring that all intents are processed but without any associated data.\n  \n- If duplicate queries are provided under the same intent, the function will still record each instance, as this might be intentional depending on the use case (e.g., tracking frequency of certain queries).\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\n# Example of how to call the function with multiple intents and their associated queries\nrecord_classifications(\n    greeting=[\"Hello\", \"Hi there\", \"Good morning\"],\n    farewell=[\"Goodbye\", \"See you later\", \"Take care\"],\n    inquiry=[\"What's the weather", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["acc_routing_start", "atm_finder_start", "faq_link_accounts_start", "get_balance_start", "get_transactions_start", "outofscope"], "properties": {"acc_routing_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries requesting the bank routing numbers or account numbers."}, "atm_finder_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for locations of ATMs, specified in the format of 'City, State (abbr)', such as 'Berkeley, CA' or 'New York, NY'."}, "faq_link_accounts_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to linking accounts within the bank's system."}, "get_balance_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for account balances, available funds, or other financial balances."}, "get_transactions_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to viewing transactions, deposits, purchases, and transaction details."}, "outofscope": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries that do not classify to any other available intents."}}}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"record_classifications": {"greeting": ["Hello", "Hi there", "Good morning"], "farewell": ["Goodbye", "See you later", "Take care"], "inquiry": ["What's the weather Note that the provided function is in Python 3 syntax."], "intent_name": "outofscope"}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"record_classifications": {"greeting": ["Hello", "Hi there", "Good morning"], "farewell": ["Goodbye", "See you later", "Take care"], "inquiry": ["What's the weather Note that the provided function is in Python 3 syntax."], "intent_name": "outofscope"}}], "possible_answer": [{"record1": {"acc_routing_start": [], "atm_finder_start": [], "faq_link_accounts_start": [], "get_balance_start": [], "get_transactions_start": [], "outofscope": [["what is the weather like"]]}}, {"record2": {"acc_routing_start": [], "atm_finder_start": [], "faq_link_accounts_start": [], "get_balance_start": [], "get_transactions_start": [], "outofscope": [["what is the weather like"]]}}, {"record3": {"acc_routing_start": [], "atm_finder_start": [], "faq_link_accounts_start": [], "get_balance_start": [], "get_transactions_start": [], "outofscope": [["what is the weather like"]]}}]}

It utilizes three primary input parameters: the yearly yield, the investment amount, and the time period. Here is a detailed breakdown of each component involved in the calculation:\n\n1. **Yearly Yield**: This parameter represents the rate of return that the mutual fund is expected to generate annually. It is typically expressed as a percentage. The yearly yield is crucial as it directly impacts the growth rate of the investment over time. For example, a yearly yield of 5% suggests that the fund is projected to grow by 5% each year.\n\n2. **Investment Amount**: This specifies the initial sum of money that is invested in the mutual fund. It is an essential input because the final estimated return is proportional to the amount of capital invested. A higher investment amount will generally result in a higher estimated return, assuming the yield and time period remain constant.\n\n3. **Time Period**: This parameter indicates the duration, usually measured in years, for which the investment is held in the mutual fund. The time period is significant because the effect of compounding can increase the return over longer durations. For instance, leaving the investment for a longer period can lead to a greater cumulative return due to the compounding effect on the yearly yield.\n\nThe function processes these inputs to estimate the total return at the end of the specified time period. It assumes that the yearly yield is consistent throughout the investment period and that there are no additional contributions or withdrawals from the original investment amount during this time.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\nTo understand how this function operates, consider the following example:\n\nSuppose you are assessing the potential return on a mutual fund with a yearly yield of 7%, an initial investment amount of $10,000, and a time period of 5 years.

The primary purpose of this function is to run commands directly in the operating system's command-line interface (CLI), which is generally the Command Prompt on Windows.\n\nA notable feature of this function is its ability to execute not just a single command, but also multiple commands chained together.

This return value can be used to perform further error handling or logging within your program.

This behavior can be particularly beneficial in scenarios where the outcome of one command is a prerequisite for the subsequent command to execute correctly. For instance, you could use this functionality to compile a program and, if successful, immediately proceed to execute the compiled program.\n\nIt's important to note that this function is intended exclusively for use on Windows operating systems, as the execution of system commands may vary across different environments, and the syntax for chaining commands with '&&' is specific to Windows command line behavior. Additionally, users should exercise caution when executing system-level commands to avoid unintentional modifications or damage to the system.\n\nHere is a basic usage example of how one might invoke this function in a script:\n\n```python\n# Example of executing a single command\nos.system(\"dir\")\n\n# Example of executing multiple commands chained with '&&'\nos.system(\"mkdir new_folder && cd new_folder\")\n```\n\nIn the first example, the function calls `os.system(\"dir\")`, which lists the contents of the current directory. In the second example, it attempts to create a new directory named 'new_folder' and, if successful, changes the current directory to 'new_folder'.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

This ensures that when referring to or managing services like cleaning or ironing, there is no ambiguity about which service is being addressed. The unique identifier plays a critical role in operations such as scheduling, billing, and tracking service requests. \n\nAn edge case to consider is when a service does not have a unique identifier due to an error in the system; this could lead to issues in the service management process. Therefore, it is essential to maintain data integrity and ensure that each service is appropriately assigned an identifier upon its creation or registration in the system.\n\nFor implementing the function, it may accept parameters that specify the type of service for which the identifier is being requested, such as a service name or category. The function would then return the corresponding unique identifier, facilitating further actions or queries related to that specific service. \n\nFor example, if a user queries the system for the identifier of an \"ironing service,\" the function will return a unique ID that distinctly represents the ironing service among various other services.

The unique identifier serves as a distinguishing attribute that allows the system to identify and interact with the service in question accurately. When calling this function, you must provide the service type, which is typically a string or enumerated value that categorizes the service into a predefined group or class.\n\n### Parameters:\n\n- **serviceType**: This parameter represents the type or category of the service for which you want to obtain the unique identifier. It must be provided in a format recognized by the system, often as a string, such as \"billing\", \"streaming\", or \"authentication\", or potentially as an enum if the system uses strongly typed languages.\n\n### Return Value:\n\nThe function returns the unique identifier, which is typically a string or numeric value. This identifier is guaranteed to be unique across all services of the same type within the system, ensuring that no two services of the same type have the same identifier.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n\n- If the service type provided does not exist or is not recognized by the system, the function may return a null value or throw an error, depending on the implementation. It is crucial to handle such scenarios to avoid unexpected failures.\n- In cases where multiple services share the same type, the function will return the identifier of the specific service matching the criteria set by the system's internal logic, which may include additional parameters or context not outlined here.\n\n### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose you are working with a system that manages several types of services and you need to retrieve the unique identifier for the \"billing\" service. You would call the function with \"billing\" as the argument, and the function would return a unique ID like \"billing-1234\". This ID can then be used for further operations related to the billing service, such as configuration updates or status checks.\n\nIn summary, this function is a crucial component for systems requiring precise management and interaction with various", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["service_id"], "properties": {"service_id": {"type": "integer", "description": "The unique identifier of the service.

These two parameters serve as crucial identifiers to access the correct lawsuit records from a potentially vast database.\n\nParameters:\n\n1. Case Number: A unique numerical or alphanumeric identifier assigned to a lawsuit when it is filed. This number is critical as it distinctly identifies a lawsuit within the records of a particular court. It is essential to ensure that the correct case number is used, as even a small error can lead to retrieving incorrect or no information.\n\n2. Court Location: This parameter specifies the geographical or jurisdictional location of the court where the lawsuit was filed. Court location is vital because case numbers may not be unique across different court systems. Identifying the correct court ensures that the search is conducted in the right jurisdiction, thereby increasing the accuracy of retrieving the intended lawsuit details.\n\nEdge Cases and Considerations:\n\n- Inaccurate Input: Ensure that both the case number and court location are entered correctly. Inaccurate or incomplete data can result in failure to retrieve any lawsuit details or may return incorrect information.\n- Nonexistent Records: If the combination of the case number and court location does not match any existing lawsuit, the function should handle such scenarios gracefully, possibly by returning a message indicating that no records were found.\n- Multiple Matches: Although unlikely if inputs are correct, consider how the function should handle situations where multiple records match the input parameters, ensuring that the correct lawsuit is identified and returned.\n\nUsage Example:\n\nSuppose a user needs to obtain details of a lawsuit with the case number \"2023-CV-04567\" filed in the \"New York County Supreme Court.\" They would invoke the function with these two parameters:\n\n```python\nretrieve_lawsuit_details(case_number=\"2023-CV-04567\", court_location=\"New York County Supreme Court\")\n```\n\nThis invocation should return all available information about the lawsuit, such as parties involved", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"case_number": {"type": "string", "description": "Case number of the lawsuit."}, "court_location": {"type": "string", "description": "The location of the court where the lawsuit was filed."}, "with_verdict": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Flag to include verdict details if available.

The calculation is based on three crucial parameters: the distance traveled by the vehicle in that year, the type of fuel the vehicle uses, and the fuel efficiency of the vehicle.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n1. **Distance Traveled**: This parameter represents the total number of miles or kilometers the vehicle has traveled in a year. It is a critical factor, as greater distances typically result in higher emissions.\n\n2. **Fuel Type**: The type of fuel the vehicle uses significantly impacts the calculation. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, electric, and hybrid options. Each fuel type has a specific carbon emissions factor, which denotes the amount of carbon dioxide produced per unit of fuel consumed. This emissions factor is essential for accurately estimating the vehicle's carbon footprint.\n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency**: This represents how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel, usually expressed in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). Higher fuel efficiency indicates that the vehicle can travel further on a smaller amount of fuel, potentially reducing the total emissions.\n\n**Calculation Process:**\n\nThe function combines these parameters to estimate the annual carbon dioxide emissions. It considers the distance traveled and divides it by the vehicle's fuel efficiency to determine the total fuel consumed over the year. This result is then multiplied by the carbon emissions factor associated with the selected fuel type to calculate the total emissions in terms of carbon dioxide.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n- If the distance traveled is zero, the function should correctly return zero emissions, as no travel means no fuel consumption or emissions.\n- If the fuel efficiency is excessively high, it could result in minimal emissions even for significant travel distances, which should be correctly processed.\n- Different fuel types with different emissions factors must be handled accurately to reflect real-world differences in carbon output.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\nSuppose a vehicle travels 15,000 kilometers in", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"distance": {"type": "integer", "description": "The distance travelled in miles."}, "fuel_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of fuel used by the vehicle."}, "fuel_efficiency": {"type": "float", "description": "The vehicle's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon."}, "efficiency_reduction": {"type": "integer", "description": "The percentage decrease in fuel efficiency per year (optional).

The primary purpose of this function is to handle raw fMRI data, which may consist of complex time-series information captured from brain scans, and apply various analytical techniques to extract meaningful insights. \n\n#### Input\n- **fMRI Data**: The function accepts fMRI data, which typically comprises three-dimensional or four-dimensional datasets that represent brain activity over time. This data is usually formatted in standard neuroimaging file formats, such as NIfTI or DICOM. The input may also contain metadata that provides additional context or information necessary for proper analysis.\n\n#### Process\n- The function employs a series of analytical methods to process the input data. These methods may include pre-processing steps such as motion correction, spatial normalization, and temporal filtering. The analysis may also involve statistical techniques to identify patterns of brain activity, connectivity assessments to examine neural networks, or machine learning approaches to classify or predict specific cognitive states or responses.\n\n#### Output\n- **Analyzed Data**: The result of the function is a set of analyzed data that provides insights into the brain's activity patterns. This output can be in the form of statistical maps, graphs representing neural connectivity, or other data visualizations that highlight significant findings. The analyzed data is typically ready for further interpretation by researchers or clinicians.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n- The function should handle cases where the input data is incomplete or contains artifacts that could affect analysis. It should be robust enough to manage variability in data quality and accommodate different scanning protocols or resolutions.\n\n#### Usage Example\n```python\n# Example usage of the function\nraw_fmri_data = load_fmri_data(file_path)\nanalyzed_results = analyze_fmri_data(raw_fmri_data)\ndisplay_results(analyzed_results)\n```\n\nThis function is essential for neuroscientists and researchers who require efficient and accurate", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"data_source": {"type": "string", "description": "The path where the data is stored."}, "sequence_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of fMRI sequence"}, "smooth": {"type": "integer", "description": "Spatial smoothing FWHM.

By leveraging the powerful search capabilities of Spotify, the function allows users to input a query that can include parts of the song title, artist name, album, or other related metadata. Upon receiving the query, the function initiates a search within Spotify's extensive music library to find the best match or list of matches that correspond to the user's input.\n\nOnce the function identifies the correct song from the search results, it proceeds to play the song through the Spotify platform. The function ensures that the song is played using the user's Spotify account, provided that the account is authenticated and has the necessary permissions to play music through the service.\n\n#### Parameter Explanation\n\n- **query**: The query parameter is a string that represents the search term or terms the user wishes to use to find a song on Spotify. This can be a fragment or complete song title, the artist's name, album name, or a combination thereof. The query should be formulated to maximize the accuracy of the search results.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\nSuppose a user wants to listen to \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by Queen. The user can call the function with the query parameter set to \"Bohemian Rhapsody Queen\" or simply \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" to search for the song. The function will then search Spotify's library, identify the track, and proceed to play it.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n\n- If the query does not correspond to any identifiable song, the function should handle this scenario gracefully, possibly by returning an error message or prompt indicating that no match was found.\n- If multiple songs match the query closely, the function may either play the first result or prompt the user to choose from a list of possible matches.\n- The function requires an active internet connection and a valid Spotify account with streaming permissions to function correctly.

The default value for this parameter is `false`, indicating that child projects will be included unless the user specifies otherwise.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- If the `team_id` provided does not correspond to any existing team, the function may return an empty list or an error message, depending on implementation details.\n\n- When both `exclude_inactive` and `exclude_child_projects` are set to `true`, the resulting list will contain only active, standalone projects associated with the specified team.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose a project manager wants to retrieve a list of all active projects for Team Alpha without any child projects. The function call would look something like this:\n\n```plaintext\nretrieve_team_projects(team_id=\"alpha123\",", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["uuid"], "properties": {"uuid": {"type": "string", "description": "The UUID of the team for which to retrieve the project mappings."}, "excludeInactive": {"type": "boolean", "description": "If set to true, inactive projects will be excluded from the results.", "default": false}, "onlyRoot": {"type": "boolean", "description": "If set to true, only root projects will be returned, excluding any child projects.", "default": false}}}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"acl_api.AclApi.retrieve_projects1": {"uuid": "12", "excludeInactive": false, "onlyRoot": true}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"acl_api.AclApi.retrieve_projects1": {"uuid": "12", "excludeInactive": false, "onlyRoot": true}}], "possible_answer": [{"acl_api.AclApi.retrieve_projects1": {"uuid": ["12"], "excludeInactive": [true], "onlyRoot": [true]}}, {"acl_api.AclApi.retrieve_projects2": {"uuid": ["12"], "excludeInactive": [true], "onlyRoot": [true]}}, {"acl_api.AclApi.retrieve_projects3": {"uuid": ["12"], "excludeInactive": [true], "onlyRoot": [true]}}]}

This calculation is important for ensuring that you purchase the correct amount of paint to complete your project without excess or shortage.\n\n### Parameters:\n- **surfaceArea (float):** This parameter represents the total area that needs to be painted, typically measured in square feet or square meters. The surface area should be a positive number and can include the area of walls, ceilings, or any other surface you intend to paint.\n  \n- **coverageRate (float):** This parameter is the coverage rate of the paint, indicating how much area one unit (such as a gallon or liter) of the paint can cover. This is typically specified by the paint manufacturer and should be provided as a positive number. The coverage rate is usually expressed in units of area per unit of paint, such as square feet per gallon or square meters per liter.\n\n### Functionality:\nThe function works by dividing the total surface area to be painted by the coverage rate of the paint. This calculation determines how many units of paint are necessary to cover the specified area completely. It is crucial to use consistent units for both the surface area and the coverage rate to ensure accurate results.\n\n### Example Usage:\nSuppose you have a wall with a surface area of 500 square feet and a paint that covers 250 square feet per gallon. By calling the function with these parameters, it will compute the total gallons of paint required as follows: 500 (surface area) divided by 250 (coverage rate) equals 2 gallons of paint needed.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- If the surface area is zero, the function should return zero since no paint is needed. \n- If the coverage rate is zero or close to zero, the function should handle this scenario appropriately, potentially by returning an error or a warning, since a coverage rate of zero implies that the paint cannot cover", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"coverage_rate": {"type": "integer", "description": "The area in square feet that one gallon of paint can cover."}, "length": {"type": "integer", "description": "Length of the wall to be painted in feet."}, "height": {"type": "integer", "description": "Height of the wall to be painted in feet."}}, "required": ["coverage_rate", "length", "height"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"calculate_paint_needed2": {"surfaceArea": 360, "coverageRate": 400}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"calculate_paint_needed2": {"surfaceArea": 360, "coverageRate": 400}}], "possible_answer": [{"calculate_paint_needed1": {"coverage_rate": [400], "length": [30], "height": [12]}}, {"calculate_paint_needed2": {"coverage_rate": [400], "length": [30], "height": [12]}}, {"calculate_paint_needed3": {"coverage_rate": [400], "length": [30], "height": [12]}}]}

Blackjack is a popular card game where the main objective is to achieve a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. In a standard game, players compete against the dealer rather than each other, trying to either beat the dealer\u2019s hand or have the dealer bust (go over 21).\n\n#### Key Functionalities:\n1. **Assessing Hand Values**: The function calculates the total value of both the player's and the dealer's hands by summing the values of the individual cards. Special attention is given to the Ace card, which can be counted as either 1 or 11, depending on which value keeps the hand total closest to 21 without busting.\n\n2. **Bust Condition**: If either the player's or dealer's hand exceeds a total of 21, it is considered a \u2018bust,\u2019 and the other party automatically wins, provided they have a valid hand. The function ensures that this rule is rigorously applied to determine the winner.\n\n3. **Comparing Hand Values**: In cases where no bust occurs, the function compares the hand values. The hand with a total closer to 21 is determined to be the winner. It also handles the scenario where both hands have the same value, which typically results in a \u2018push\u2019 or tie, where neither party wins.\n\n4. **Blackjack Condition**: If a player or dealer achieves a hand value of exactly 21 with their initial two cards (usually an Ace and a 10-value card), it is considered a \u2018blackjack,\u2019 and this hand typically beats all other 21-value hands that are not blackjacks. The function incorporates this rule in determining the outcome.\n\n#### Edge Cases Handled:\n- If both the dealer and player bust, the function will determine the winner based on the specific rules of the game implemented, which can vary; generally, this", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"player_cards": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "Cards held by the player."}, "dealer_cards": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "Cards held by the dealer."}, "ace_value": {"type": "integer", "description": "The value considered for the ace card, can be either 1 or 11.", "default": 11}}, "required": ["player_cards", "dealer_cards"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"blackjack.check_winner1": {"player_cards": ["A", "10"], "dealer_cards": ["10", "9"], "ace_value": 11}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"blackjack.check_winner1": {"player_cards": ["A", "10"], "dealer_cards": ["10", "9"], "ace_value": 11}}], "possible_answer": [{"blackjack.check_winner1": {"player_cards": [["A", "10"]], "dealer_cards": [["10", "9"]], "ace_value": [1]}}, {"blackjack.check_winner2": {"player_cards": [["A", "10"]], "dealer_cards": [["10", "9"]], "ace_value": [1]}}, {"blackjack.check_winner3": {"player_cards": [["A", "10"]], "dealer_cards": [["10", "9"]], "ace_value": [1]}}]}

This parameter is crucial as it narrows down the search to a specific geographic location, ensuring that the recommendations are relevant to the user's needs.\n\n- The second parameter, `review_rate`, is a numeric value that determines the minimum average review rating that a sushi place must have to be considered in the results. This parameter helps filter out sushi restaurants that do not meet a certain quality standard, as perceived by previous customers. It ensures that only sushi places with a review rating equal to or higher than this specified value are included in the final output.\n\n- The third parameter, `top number`, is an integer that indicates the number of top sushi places to return. This parameter allows users to limit the number of results based on their preference. For example, if a user only wants to see the top 5 sushi places, they would set this parameter to 5. The function then provides a list containing the specified number of sushi restaurants, ranked according to their ratings and other relevant criteria.\n\nBy combining these parameters, the function is able to generate a tailored list of sushi restaurants that are highly regarded within the specified city and meet or exceed the given review rate.

This functionality is crucial for applications that require accurate conversion rates for financial transactions, ensuring that users are aware of the total cost involved when exchanging one currency for another.\n\n### Parameters:\n- **from_currency** (string): The code of the currency you wish to convert from. This should be a valid ISO 4217 currency code.\n- **to_currency** (string): The code of the currency you wish to convert to. Similar to the from_currency, this should also be a valid ISO 4217 currency code.\n- **transaction_fee_percentage** (float, optional): A percentage value representing the transaction fee to be added to the exchange rate. This parameter allows users to see the effective rate after fees are taken into account, which can vary depending on the financial institution or service provider.\n\n### Returns:\n- **effective_rate** (float): The calculated effective exchange rate between the two specified currencies after factoring in the transaction fee. This rate provides a more realistic representation of what a user will receive or pay when converting currencies.\n\n### Usage Example:\nSuppose you want to find out how much USD you would get for 100 EUR, and the transaction fee is 2%. You would call the function with 'EUR' as the from_currency, 'USD' as the to_currency, and 2 as the transaction_fee_percentage. The function will return the effective exchange rate, which you can use to calculate the amount in USD, knowing that it accounts for the 2% additional cost.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- Ensure that both currency codes are valid and supported. If an unsupported or invalid code is provided, the function should handle this gracefully, possibly returning an error or a default value indicating the invalid input.\n- Consider scenarios where the transaction fee might be zero, in which case the effective exchange rate would equal the base exchange rate without any additional costs.\n- Handle cases where network issues or data", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"base_currency": {"type": "string", "description": "The base currency."}, "target_currency": {"type": "string", "description": "The target currency."}, "fee": {"type": "float", "description": "The transaction fee in percentage.
