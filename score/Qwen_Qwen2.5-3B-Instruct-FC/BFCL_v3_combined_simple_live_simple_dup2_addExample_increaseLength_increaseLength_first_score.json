The city parameter should represent the name of the city for which you want to obtain weather data. It is important to ensure the city name is spelled correctly to avoid fetching incorrect or no data.

This abbreviation is crucial because it helps the function differentiate between cities with the same name across different states.\n\nWhen using this function, it is essential to input both parameters accurately, as providing only the city name might lead to ambiguity, especially if there are multiple cities with the same name in different states. For instance, there is a Springfield in both Illinois (IL) and Massachusetts (MA), so specifying the state is necessary to retrieve the correct weather information for the desired location.\n\nAn example of how you might call this function could be:\n\n```python\nget_weather_conditions(\"Los Angeles\", \"CA\")\n```\n\nThis would return the current weather conditions for Los Angeles, California. In terms of error handling, if an invalid city name or state abbreviation is provided, the function may return an error or a null response, indicating that the location could not be found.

This frequency is particularly relevant in applications such as radio transmitters and receivers, filters, and oscillators.\n\nTo determine the resonant frequency, the function uses the standard formula for the resonant frequency of an LC circuit, which is given by:\n\n\\[ f_r = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\sqrt{L \\cdot C}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( f_r \\) is the resonant frequency in hertz (Hz),\n- \\( L \\) is the inductance in henries (H),\n- \\( C \\) is the capacitance in farads (F),\n- \\( \\pi \\) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159.\n\nWhen using this function, it is important to provide the values of the inductor and capacitor in their respective units to ensure the correct calculation of the resonant frequency. The function typically checks for valid input values, as negative or zero values for inductance or capacitance would not be physically meaningful and would result in mathematical errors such as division by zero or square root of a negative number.\n\nUsage example:\nSuppose you have an LC circuit with an inductance of 0.005 henries (5 milliHenries) and a capacitance of 0.000001 farads (1 microFarad). By passing these values to the function, it will compute the resonant frequency as follows:\n\n\\[ f_r = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\sqrt{0.005 \\cdot 0.000001}} \\]\n\nThis example demonstrates how the function utilizes the input parameters to provide the resonant frequency, allowing engineers and hobbyists", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"inductance": {"type": "float", "description": "The inductance (L) in henries (H)."}, "capacitance": {"type": "float", "description": "The capacitance (C) in farads (F)."}, "round_off": {"type": "integer", "description": "Rounding off the result to a certain decimal places, default is 2."}}, "required": ["inductance", "capacitance"]}}, {"name": "calculate_resonant_frequency2", "description": "Calculate the resonant frequency of an LC (inductor-capacitor) circuit.Example: calculate_resonant_frequency(inductance=0.01, capacitance=0.001) returns 1591.55\n\nExample: calculate_resonant_frequency(inductance=0.05, capacitance=0.002, round_off=3) returns 504.647", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"inductance": {"type": "float", "description": "The inductance (L) in henries (H)."}, "capacitance": {"type": "float", "description": "The capacitance (C) in farads (F)."}, "round_off": {"type": "integer", "description": "Rounding off the result to a certain decimal places, default is 2."}}, "required": ["inductance", "capacitance"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"calculate_resonant_frequency1": {"inductance": 0.05, "capacitance": 1e-05, "round_off": 2}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"calculate_resonant_frequency1": {"inductance": 0.05, "capacitance": 1e-05, "round_off": 2}}], "possible_answer": [{"calculate_resonant_frequency1": {"inductance": [0.05], "capacitance": [0.0001], "round_off": ["", 2]}}, {"calculate_resonant_frequency2": {"inductance": [0.05], "capacitance": [0.0001], "round_off": ["", 2]}}, {"calculate_resonant_frequency3": {"inductance": [0.05], "capacitance": [0.0001], "round_off": ["", 2]}}]}

In thermodynamics, entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness in a system, and understanding changes in entropy is crucial for analyzing energy exchanges in various physical and chemical processes.\n\nFor an isothermal process, the temperature remains constant throughout the entire process. This condition is significant because it allows simplifications in the calculation of entropy. The function assumes that the system is in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings, maintaining a constant temperature.\n\nIn addition to being isothermal, the process is also reversible. A reversible process is an idealized concept in thermodynamics where the system changes in such a way that both the system and its surroundings can be returned to their original states with no net change. Reversible processes are an important theoretical model because they represent the maximum efficiency with which energy can be converted or transferred.\n\nTo calculate the entropy change, the function uses the formula:\n\n\\[ \\Delta S = \\frac{Q_{\\text{rev}}}{T} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\Delta S \\) is the change in entropy.\n- \\( Q_{\\text{rev}} \\) is the amount of heat absorbed or released by the system during the reversible process.\n- \\( T \\) is the absolute temperature at which the process occurs.\n\nThis formula highlights the direct relationship between the heat exchanged and entropy change for a reversible process: the greater the amount of heat exchanged at a given temperature, the greater the change in entropy.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\nConsider a system where 500 J of heat is absorbed from a reservoir at a constant temperature of 300 K. The entropy change for this reversible and isothermal process would be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\Delta S = \\frac{500 \\, \\text{J}}{300 \\, \\text{K}} = 1.67 \\, \\text{J/K} \\]\n\nThis result indicates the increase in the system's entropy due to the", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"initial_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial temperature in Kelvin."}, "final_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The final temperature in Kelvin."}, "heat_capacity": {"type": "integer", "description": "The heat capacity in J/K."}, "isothermal": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether the process is isothermal.

Conversely, when the descending order is selected, the list is reordered such that each element is greater than or equal to the one that follows, resulting in numbers being sorted from largest to smallest, or strings from Z to A.\n\nThe function handles a variety of lists, even those that are initially unsorted, and returns a new list in the desired order without altering the original list unless specified otherwise. In edge cases where the list is empty or contains elements that are already in the desired order, the function will handle these gracefully, simply returning the list as is.\n\nUsage example:\n- To sort a list of integers `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]` in ascending order, the function call would return `[1, 1, 3, 4, 5]`.\n- For descending order, the same list would be reordered to `[5, 4, 3, 1, 1]`.\n\nParameters:\n- `list`: The list of elements to be sorted. It must be composed of comparable types.\n- `order`: A flag that indicates the desired sorting order. Typically, a boolean or string value (e.g., 'asc' for ascending or 'desc' for descending) that dictates whether the sorting should be in ascending or descending order.\n\nIn summary, this function provides a flexible and robust solution for sorting lists according", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"list": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "float"}, "description": "The list of numbers to be sorted."}, "order": {"type": "string", "enum": ["ascending", "descending"], "description": "Order of sorting."}}, "required": ["list", "order"]}}, {"name": "array_sort2", "description": "Sorts a given list in ascending or descending order.Example: array_sort(list=[3.2, 1.5, 4.8, 2.9], order='ascending') returns [1.5, 2.9, 3.2, 4.8].\n\nExample: array_sort(list=[7.1, 5.3, 6.6, 8.2], order='descending') returns [8.2, 7.1, 6.6, 5.3].", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"list": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "float"}, "description": "The list of numbers to be sorted."}, "order": {"type": "string", "enum": ["ascending", "descending"], "description": "Order of sorting."}}, "required": ["list", "order"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"array_sort1": {"list": [5, 3, 4, 1, 2], "order": "ascending"}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"array_sort1": {"list": [5, 3, 4, 1, 2], "order": "ascending"}}], "possible_answer": [{"array_sort1": {"list": [[5.0, 3.0, 4.0, 1.0, 2.0]], "order": ["ascending"]}}, {"array_sort2": {"list": [[5.0, 3.0, 4.0, 1.0, 2.0]], "order": ["ascending"]}}, {"array_sort3": {"list": [[5.0, 3.0, 4.0, 1.0, 2.0]], "order": ["ascending"]}}]}

Label encoding replaces each category with a unique integer, which is suitable for algorithms that can naturally handle categorical data.\n\nBy performing these preprocessing steps, the function ensures that the dataset is in an optimal format for training machine learning models.

It accomplishes this by determining the positions of each hand relative to 12 o'clock and then computes the angle formed between them.\n\n### How the Function Works:\n1. **Input Parameters**: The function requires two input parameters representing the time of interest: \n   - `hour`: An integer value ranging from 0 to 23, representing the hour portion of the time. This allows for calculation in both AM and PM formats.\n   - `minute`: An integer value ranging from 0 to 59, indicating the minute portion of the time.\n\n2. **Position Calculation**:\n   - **Hour Hand Position**: The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours. Therefore, it moves 30 degrees per hour (360 degrees / 12 hours). Additionally, for every minute that passes, the hour hand moves 0.5 degrees (30 degrees / 60 minutes).\n   - **Minute Hand Position**: The minute hand completes a full circle, or 360 degrees, in 60 minutes. Hence, it moves 6 degrees per minute (360 degrees / 60 minutes).\n\n3. **Angle Calculation**:\n   - **Raw Angle**: The function first calculates the absolute difference between the angles of the hour and minute hands.\n   - **Minimal Angle**: Since the clock is circular, the function determines the smaller angle. This is done by taking the minimum between the raw angle and 360 degrees minus the raw angle, ensuring that the angle is always 180 degrees or less.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- **Exact hour**: If the minute is set to zero, the calculation must handle the scenario where the minute hand is at the 12 o'clock position, and the position of the hour hand is straightforwardly `hour * 30` degrees.\n- **Midnight and Noon**: These times are special cases", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"hours": {"type": "integer", "description": "The hour on the clock face."}, "minutes": {"type": "integer", "description": "The minutes on the clock face."}, "round_to": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of decimal places to round the result to, default is 2."}}, "required": ["hours", "minutes"]}}, {"name": "calculate_clock_angle2", "description": "Calculate the angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock at a given time.Example: calculate_clock_angle(hours=3, minutes=15) returns 7.5\n\nExample: calculate_clock_angle(hours=9, minutes=0) returns 90.0\n\nExample: calculate_clock_angle(hours=12, minutes=30, round_to=1) returns 165.0", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"hours": {"type": "integer", "description": "The hour on the clock face."}, "minutes": {"type": "integer", "description": "The minutes on the clock face."}, "round_to": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of decimal places to round the result to, default is 2."}}, "required": ["hours", "minutes"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"calculate_clock_angle1": {"hours": 18, "minutes": 30}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"calculate_clock_angle1": {"hours": 18, "minutes": 30}}], "possible_answer": [{"calculate_clock_angle1": {"hours": [6], "minutes": [30], "round_to": ["", 2]}}, {"calculate_clock_angle2": {"hours": [6], "minutes": [30], "round_to": ["", 2]}}, {"calculate_clock_angle3": {"hours": [6], "minutes": [30], "round_to": ["", 2]}}]}

This involves determining the definite integral of the polynomial function over the interval, which is defined by its lower and upper bounds. The polynomial function is typically expressed in the form of a sum of terms, each consisting of a coefficient and a variable raised to an integer power. The integration process involves finding the antiderivative of the polynomial and evaluating it at the boundary points of the interval. By subtracting the value of the antiderivative at the lower bound from its value at the upper bound, the function yields the total area under the curve between these two points. This calculation assumes that the polynomial function is continuous over the interval and properly defined at the endpoints. The result can provide insights into the behavior of the polynomial function over the specified range, especially in applications requiring precise area measurements such as physics, engineering, and economics.\n\nEdge cases to consider include intervals where the function intersects the horizontal axis, as portions of the area could be negative, depending on the orientation of the curve. Additionally, if the interval has a zero length (where the lower and upper bounds are equal), the resulting area will be zero, as there is no length over which to integrate. Usage of this function is essential in scenarios where determining the accumulated value represented by a polynomial function over a specific domain is required.\n\nFor example, suppose you have a polynomial function f(x) = 2x^2 + 3x + 1, and you wish to find the area under this curve from x = 1 to x = 4. The function will calculate the antiderivative of f(x), which might be F(x) = (2/3)x^3 + (3/2)x^2 + x, and then evaluate this antiderivative at x = 4 and x = 1.

For the 'purchase' intent, you might provide a list of queries such as [\"buy shoes\", \"order new laptop\"]. Similarly, for the 'support' intent, the list could include queries like [\"reset password\", \"fix printer issue\"]. The function will classify each query under its designated intent, ensuring that \"buy shoes\" and \"order new laptop\" are marked under 'purchase', while \"reset password\" and \"fix printer issue\" are categorized under 'support'.\n\nBy accurately mapping each query to its intent, this function helps streamline processing and analysis tasks, offering a structured approach to query classification. It is particularly useful in settings where large volumes of query data need to be efficiently categorized and managed based on user intent.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": [], "properties": {"acc_routing_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries requesting bank routing numbers or account numbers.", "default": []}, "atm_finder_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries asking for ATM locations or to urgently find an ATM for cash withdrawal.", "default": []}, "faq_link_accounts_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries related to linking accounts within the bank's system.", "default": []}, "get_balance_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries requesting account balances, available funds, or other financial balances.", "default": []}, "get_transactions_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries related to viewing transaction details including deposits and purchases.", "default": []}, "outofscope": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries that do not classify under any of the other available intents.", "default": []}}}}, {"name": "record2", "description": "Records classifications for a batch of queries based on specified intents.

It achieves this by leveraging keyword arguments, where each keyword corresponds to an intent name, and the associated value is a collection of queries that share this intent. By using this approach, users can perform bulk recordings of query classifications in a single function call, significantly streamlining the process.\n\n### Parameters\n\n- **intent_name**: Keyword arguments where each keyword represents the name of an intent. This acts as a label that describes the purpose or goal of the queries associated with it.\n\n- **queries**: The values that accompany each intent name keyword argument. These are the actual queries that need to be classified. They can be provided in various iterable forms, such as lists or tuples, allowing for flexibility in input data structures.\n\n### Functionality\n\nWhen you call this function, it processes each keyword argument, taking the name of the keyword as the intent and the corresponding value as the list of queries. The function then records the association between each query and its intent, effectively classifying them in bulk. This method is particularly useful for applications that require organizing a large number of queries systematically, such as natural language processing tasks, chatbots, or automated customer service systems.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- If no queries are provided for a given intent, the function will simply record the intent with an empty list of queries, ensuring that all intents are processed but without any associated data.\n  \n- If duplicate queries are provided under the same intent, the function will still record each instance, as this might be intentional depending on the use case (e.g., tracking frequency of certain queries).\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\n# Example of how to call the function with multiple intents and their associated queries\nrecord_classifications(\n    greeting=[\"Hello\", \"Hi there\", \"Good morning\"],\n    farewell=[\"Goodbye\", \"See you later\", \"Take care\"],\n    inquiry=[\"What's the weather", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["acc_routing_start", "atm_finder_start", "faq_link_accounts_start", "get_balance_start", "get_transactions_start", "outofscope"], "properties": {"acc_routing_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries requesting the bank routing numbers or account numbers."}, "atm_finder_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for locations of ATMs, specified in the format of 'City, State (abbr)', such as 'Berkeley, CA' or 'New York, NY'."}, "faq_link_accounts_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to linking accounts within the bank's system."}, "get_balance_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for account balances, available funds, or other financial balances."}, "get_transactions_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to viewing transactions, deposits, purchases, and transaction details."}, "outofscope": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries that do not classify to any other available intents."}}}}, {"name": "record2", "description": "Records classifications for a series of queries based on the intent names provided as keyword arguments.

When the input is a string, the function processes it by reversing the order of its characters, effectively providing the string in a backward reading manner. For example, if the string \"hello\" is passed as input, the function will return \"olleh\". This operation is particularly useful for operations that require backward iteration or when comparing mirrored text forms.\n\nIn the case of boolean inputs, the function operates by returning the logical negation of the input value. This means if the input is `True`, the function will return `False`, and if `False` is provided, it will return `True`. This aspect of the function is valuable in scenarios where a toggle switch or logical inversion is required.\n\nWhen the input is a number, the function calculates and returns its negative value.

The function then calculates a test statistic based on the data from the two samples, which can be compared to a critical value from a statistical distribution (such as the t-distribution or z-distribution) to assess the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis.\n\nKey parameters that might be involved in this function include the sample means, sample sizes, and standard deviations of the two groups. Additionally, the function may require a significance level (commonly denoted as alpha), which is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true, often set at 0.05 or 5%. \n\nAn important aspect of this function is ensuring that the samples are indeed independent, meaning the sample from one group does not influence or affect the sample from the other group.

This calculation is based on two key inputs: the total dividend payout for the quarter and the number of outstanding shares.\n\n- **Total Dividend Payout**: This is the complete amount of money that a company has decided to distribute to its shareholders during a specific quarter. It reflects the portion of the company's earnings allocated to its shareholders as a return on their investment in the form of dividends.\n\n- **Outstanding Shares**: This refers to the total number of shares that are currently held by all shareholders, including institutional investors and company insiders, but excluding any shares that the company holds in its treasury.\n\nThe function takes these inputs and divides the total dividend payout by the number of outstanding shares. This division yields the quarterly dividend per share, which represents the amount of money each shareholder would receive for each share they own during that quarter. It is crucial for the inputs to be accurately provided to ensure the calculated dividend per share reflects the true distribution intended by the company's board of directors.\n\nThis function is particularly useful for investors and analysts who wish to determine the yield of their investment based on the company's performance and dividend policy. By understanding the quarterly dividend per share, shareholders can better assess the income generated from their investment.\n\n**Example Usage**:\nSuppose a company announces a total quarterly dividend payout of $10 million, and there are 5 million outstanding shares.

The `os.system()` function is a straightforward method for running shell commands directly from within a Python script, effectively allowing the script to interact with the system's command line interface.\n\nWhen using this function, you have the flexibility to execute a single command or multiple commands in a sequence.

It does so by taking into account three primary parameters: the total initial investment amount, the annual yield rate, and the investment time period. These parameters are crucial for accurately determining how much the initial investment will grow over the specified time period.\n\n- **Total Initial Investment**: This parameter represents the amount of money initially invested in the mutual fund. It serves as the principal amount from which the investment will grow, based on the specified yield rate.\n\n- **Annual Yield Rate**: The annual yield rate is expressed as a percentage and signifies the expected rate of return on the investment each year. It is used to calculate the compound interest earned on the initial investment over the specified period.\n\n- **Time Period**: This parameter specifies the duration, typically in years, for which the investment will be held in the mutual fund. It determines how many times the annual yield rate should be applied to the initial investment.\n\nThe function employs the principles of compound interest to calculate the final balance. Compound interest involves reinvesting the earnings each year, so that interest is earned on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous years.

The primary purpose of this function is to allow users to pass command-line instructions directly to the operating system for execution. It is particularly useful for automating tasks that would otherwise require manual input in a command prompt window.\n\nThe function can handle both single commands and multiple commands that are chained together using the logical AND operator, represented by '&&'. When multiple commands are chained with '&&', each command is executed sequentially, and execution only continues to the next command if the previous command completes successfully.

For instance, you could use this functionality to compile a program and, if successful, immediately proceed to execute the compiled program.\n\nIt's important to note that this function is intended exclusively for use on Windows operating systems, as the execution of system commands may vary across different environments, and the syntax for chaining commands with '&&' is specific to Windows command line behavior.

For complex tasks, create and run a .bat file.This function is designed to execute a specified command by utilizing the `os.system()` function, which is native to Python's standard library and specifically caters to operations within Windows operating systems. The primary role of this function is to send a command-line instruction directly to the Windows shell for execution. When dealing with multiple commands that need to be executed in sequence, you should separate each command with the '&&' operator. This ensures that commands are executed one after another, and if one command fails, the subsequent commands will not be executed. This chaining mechanism can be particularly useful for simple tasks that require multiple steps to complete.\n\nHowever, when the task at hand is more complex and involves a series of intricate operations or requires error handling, it is advisable to create a batch file (.bat). A batch file can encapsulate a sequence of commands in a file that can be executed as a single entity. This method is more robust for complex scenarios because it allows for more sophisticated scripting capabilities, such as loop constructs, conditional statements, and error checking, providing greater control over the execution flow.\n\nHere is an example of using this function:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Example of executing a single command\nos.system('echo Hello World')\n\n# Example of executing multiple commands\nos.system('cd C:\\\\ && dir')\n\n# For complex tasks, write the commands to a .bat file and execute it\nwith open('task.bat', 'w') as file:\n    file.write('echo Hello\\n')\n    file.write('cd C:\\\\\\n')\n    file.write('dir\\n')\n\nos.system('task.bat')\n```\n\nIn this example, the first `os.system()` call demonstrates executing a single command, which simply echoes \"Hello World\" to the console.

The calculation is based on three crucial parameters: the distance traveled by the vehicle in that year, the type of fuel the vehicle uses, and the fuel efficiency of the vehicle.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n1. **Distance Traveled**: This parameter represents the total number of miles or kilometers the vehicle has traveled in a year. It is a critical factor, as greater distances typically result in higher emissions.\n\n2. **Fuel Type**: The type of fuel the vehicle uses significantly impacts the calculation. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, electric, and hybrid options. Each fuel type has a specific carbon emissions factor, which denotes the amount of carbon dioxide produced per unit of fuel consumed. This emissions factor is essential for accurately estimating the vehicle's carbon footprint.\n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency**: This represents how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel, usually expressed in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). Higher fuel efficiency indicates that the vehicle can travel further on a smaller amount of fuel, potentially reducing the total emissions.\n\n**Calculation Process:**\n\nThe function combines these parameters to estimate the annual carbon dioxide emissions. It considers the distance traveled and divides it by the vehicle's fuel efficiency to determine the total fuel consumed over the year. This result is then multiplied by the carbon emissions factor associated with the selected fuel type to calculate the total emissions in terms of carbon dioxide.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n- If the distance traveled is zero, the function should correctly return zero emissions, as no travel means no fuel consumption or emissions.\n- If the fuel efficiency is excessively high, it could result in minimal emissions even for significant travel distances, which should be correctly processed.\n- Different fuel types with different emissions factors must be handled accurately to reflect real-world differences in carbon output.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\nSuppose a vehicle travels 15,000 kilometers in", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"distance": {"type": "integer", "description": "The distance travelled in miles."}, "fuel_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of fuel used by the vehicle."}, "fuel_efficiency": {"type": "float", "description": "The vehicle's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon."}, "efficiency_reduction": {"type": "integer", "description": "The percentage decrease in fuel efficiency per year (optional).

The chord progression serves as the harmonic foundation over which the melody will be composed. The progression should be well-defined and structured to ensure a coherent musical output.\n\n2. **Number of Measures**: This parameter specifies the total length of the melody composition in terms of musical measures or bars. It determines how long the piece will last, with each measure typically consisting of a set number of beats depending on the time signature of the music. The melody will be constructed to fit exactly within this specified duration.\n\n3. **Instrument**: The instrument parameter defines which musical instrument the melody is intended for. It influences the timbre, range, and style of the melody, as different instruments have unique characteristics that affect how a melody is composed and perceived. Common choices include piano, guitar, violin, and flute, among others.\n\nIn executing this function, the user provides these three inputs, and the result is a melody that complements the provided chord progression, fits within the designated number of measures, and is suitable for performance on the specified instrument.

This parameter is crucial as it narrows down the search to a specific geographic location, ensuring that the recommendations are relevant to the user's needs.\n\n- The second parameter, `review_rate`, is a numeric value that determines the minimum average review rating that a sushi place must have to be considered in the results. This parameter helps filter out sushi restaurants that do not meet a certain quality standard, as perceived by previous customers. It ensures that only sushi places with a review rating equal to or higher than this specified value are included in the final output.\n\n- The third parameter, `top number`, is an integer that indicates the number of top sushi places to return. This parameter allows users to limit the number of results based on their preference. For example, if a user only wants to see the top 5 sushi places, they would set this parameter to 5. The function then provides a list containing the specified number of sushi restaurants, ranked according to their ratings and other relevant criteria.\n\nBy combining these parameters, the function is able to generate a tailored list of sushi restaurants that are highly regarded within the specified city and meet or exceed the given review rate.
