It is designed to provide a straightforward method for determining how much space the triangle occupies on a two-dimensional plane, given these two parameters.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **base (b)**: A numerical value representing the length of the base of the triangle. This value should be a positive number, as negative or zero values would not logically represent a physical dimension of a triangle.\n  \n- **height (h)**: A numerical value representing the perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite vertex of the triangle, also known as altitude. Similar to the base, this should be a positive number to ensure it accurately reflects a physical property of the triangle.\n\n#### Formula:\n\nThe area \\( A \\) of a triangle is calculated using the formula:\n\\[ A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\]\n\nThis formula derives from the understanding that the area of a triangle is essentially half the area of a rectangle with the same base and height.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- If either the base or the height is zero, the resulting area will be zero because a triangle with no height or no base does not occupy any space.\n- Negative values for base or height are not valid inputs, as dimensions cannot be negative in standard geometric interpretations.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nConsider a triangle with a base of 5 units and a height of 10 units. Using the function:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 5 \\times 10 = 25 \\]\nThus, the area of the triangle is 25 square units.\n\nThis function is particularly useful in various fields such as architecture, engineering, and any geometric calculations where understanding the spatial coverage of a triangular shape is necessary.

The primary function of this method is to ensure that the food name provided by the customer is converted to uppercase, adhering strictly to the established requirement that all food names must be in uppercase format. This transformation is crucial for maintaining consistency and potentially for interfacing with databases or other systems that rely on uppercase naming conventions for food items.\n\nWhen invoking this function, it is important to pass the food name as an argument. The function will process this input to verify whether the name is correctly formatted in uppercase. If the input is not initially in uppercase, the function will convert it to uppercase, thereby ensuring compliance with the requirement. This step prevents errors that could arise from inconsistent naming formats and guarantees that all food names are standardized.\n\nAn edge case to consider is when the input is already in uppercase; the function will recognize this and simply maintain the current format without unnecessary processing. Additionally, this function assumes that the input food name is a valid and recognized term within the system's food selection database. If the name does not match any known items, the function may need additional logic to handle such scenarios, although this is not covered in the current description.\n\nFor example, if a customer requests the food item \"pasta,\" the function would take \"pasta\" as input, convert it to \"PASTA,\" and then proceed to change the selection as requested, ensuring the system updates reflect the customer's choice in the required format.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["TheFod"], "properties": {"TheFod": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the food to be changed, provided in uppercase letters only (e.g., 'PIZZA', 'BURGER').", "enum": ["PIZZA", "BURGER", "SALAD", "SOUP", "STEAK"]}}}}, {"name": "ChaFod2", "description": "Changes the selection of food based on the customer's request, ensuring the food name provided is in uppercase as per the requirement.Example: ChaFod({'TheFod': 'PIZZA'})\n\nExample: ChaFod({'TheFod': 'BURGER'})\n\nExample: ChaFod({'TheFod': 'SALAD'})\n\nExample: ChaFod({'TheFod': 'SOUP'})\n\nExample: ChaFod({'TheFod': 'STEAK'})", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["TheFod"], "properties": {"TheFod": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the food to be changed, provided in uppercase letters only (e.g., 'PIZZA', 'BURGER').", "enum": ["PIZZA", "BURGER", "SALAD", "SOUP", "STEAK"]}}}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\nChaFod1({'TheFod': 'GREENS'})", "model_result_decoded": [{"ChaFod1": {}}], "possible_answer": [{"ChaFod1": {"TheFod": ["SALAD"]}}, {"ChaFod2": {"TheFod": ["SALAD"]}}, {"ChaFod3": {"TheFod": ["SALAD"]}}]}

The velocity is defined as the rate at which the object changes its position, expressed as the distance traveled divided by the time it took to travel that distance. To use this function, you will need to provide two key parameters: the total distance covered and the total duration of time during which the travel occurred.\n\nThe distance parameter should be input as a non-negative numerical value, typically measured in units such as meters, kilometers, miles, or any other unit of length. The duration parameter must also be a non-negative numerical value, generally measured in units of time such as seconds, minutes, or hours. It is crucial to ensure that the units of distance and time are consistent with your intended measurement for velocity, which is often represented in units such as meters per second (m/s), kilometers per hour (km/h), or miles per hour (mph).\n\nThe function will return the calculated velocity, which represents the average speed of the object during the specified duration. It is important to note that this computation assumes constant velocity, meaning that the speed does not change throughout the entire period.\n\nFor instance, if an object travels 100 meters in 20 seconds, the function will calculate the velocity as 100 meters divided by 20 seconds, resulting in a velocity of 5 meters per second.\n\nEdge cases to consider include scenarios where the duration is zero, which would result in a division by zero and potentially an undefined or infinite velocity.

The function offers flexibility by allowing users to apply optional filters to narrow down the search results according to their specific needs.\n\nOne of the optional filters available is by network IDs, which enables users to focus on alerts originating from specific networks. This is particularly useful in environments where multiple networks are being monitored and there is a need to isolate alerts to a particular network or set of networks.\n\nAdditionally, users can filter the list of alerts by sensor serial number. This option allows for a more refined search, focusing on alerts generated by a particular sensor. This can be particularly valuable in situations where a specific sensor is suspected of malfunctioning or requires closer scrutiny due to its critical role in the network.\n\nThe function also supports filtering based on the trigger metric. This filter is particularly useful for users who are interested in alerts triggered by specific conditions or thresholds being met or exceeded. By specifying a trigger metric, users can quickly identify alerts that are relevant to certain performance indicators or environmental conditions.\n\nThe paginated nature of the list ensures that even when dealing with a large volume of alerts, users can efficiently navigate through the data. Pagination helps in managing and viewing the alerts in a structured and organized manner without overwhelming the user interface with too much information at once.\n\nOverall, this function provides a robust and flexible solution for monitoring and managing alerts from sensor networks, making it easier for users to maintain oversight and quickly respond to issues as they arise.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["perPage"], "properties": {"perPage": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of alert entries per page.

When invoked, it takes an input list containing elements that can be compared with each other, such as numbers or strings. The function's operation is contingent upon a specified parameter or flag which determines the order of sorting. \n\nWhen the ascending order is chosen, the function rearranges the list so that each element is less than or equal to the element that follows it. This means numbers will start from the smallest and increment to the largest, or strings will proceed alphabetically from A to Z. Conversely, when the descending order is selected, the list is reordered such that each element is greater than or equal to the one that follows, resulting in numbers being sorted from largest to smallest, or strings from Z to A.\n\nThe function handles a variety of lists, even those that are initially unsorted, and returns a new list in the desired order without altering the original list unless specified otherwise.

It accomplishes this by determining the positions of each hand relative to 12 o'clock and then computes the angle formed between them.\n\n### How the Function Works:\n1. **Input Parameters**: The function requires two input parameters representing the time of interest: \n   - `hour`: An integer value ranging from 0 to 23, representing the hour portion of the time. This allows for calculation in both AM and PM formats.\n   - `minute`: An integer value ranging from 0 to 59, indicating the minute portion of the time.\n\n2. **Position Calculation**:\n   - **Hour Hand Position**: The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours. Therefore, it moves 30 degrees per hour (360 degrees / 12 hours). Additionally, for every minute that passes, the hour hand moves 0.5 degrees (30 degrees / 60 minutes).\n   - **Minute Hand Position**: The minute hand completes a full circle, or 360 degrees, in 60 minutes. Hence, it moves 6 degrees per minute (360 degrees / 60 minutes).\n\n3. **Angle Calculation**:\n   - **Raw Angle**: The function first calculates the absolute difference between the angles of the hour and minute hands.\n   - **Minimal Angle**: Since the clock is circular, the function determines the smaller angle.

The function returns the total amount with tax.The function is designed to compute the applicable sales tax for a specified purchase amount based on the sales tax rate of a particular jurisdiction. When provided with a purchase amount, the function determines the appropriate tax rate according to the given jurisdiction, applies this rate to calculate the sales tax due, and then adds the calculated tax to the original purchase amount. Consequently, the function returns the total amount payable, inclusive of the original purchase amount and the added sales tax.\n\n### Parameters:\n- **purchase_amount (float or int):** The monetary amount of the purchase before tax. It should be a positive numerical value representing the subtotal on which the sales tax will be computed.\n- **jurisdiction (string):** A string identifier for the geographical or political region in which the tax is being applied. This could be a state, province, or country, each having potentially different tax rates.\n\n### Return Value:\n- **total_amount (float):** This value represents the sum of the original purchase amount and the calculated sales tax. It reflects the total cost the buyer will need to pay, inclusive of the applicable sales tax for the specified jurisdiction.\n\n### Example Usage:\nSuppose a purchase is made in a jurisdiction with a sales tax rate of 5%. If the purchase amount is $100, this function will calculate a $5 sales tax, resulting in a total amount of $105 being returned. This ensures that the financial transaction reflects the correct tax obligations as determined by local laws and regulations.\n\n### Edge Cases and Considerations:\n- Ensure that the jurisdiction is correctly specified as the function relies on this to determine the correct tax rate. An incorrect jurisdiction could result in an inaccurate tax calculation.\n- The function assumes that the purchase amount is a valid numerical entry. Non-numeric or negative inputs should be handled appropriately to prevent incorrect outputs or errors.\n- It is important to verify that the tax rates for jurisdictions are up-to-date and correctly implemented in the function for accuracy.

This mathematical operation is commonly represented as base^exponent. The function takes two arguments: the first argument is the base, which is the number that will be multiplied by itself a certain number of times, and the second argument is the exponent, which specifies how many times the base is to be multiplied by itself. \n\nFor instance, if the base is 2 and the exponent is 3, the function calculates 2 raised to the power of 3, which results in 2 * 2 * 2, equaling 8. The function is capable of handling various types of exponents, whether they are positive, negative, or zero. A positive exponent indicates standard multiplication of the base, a negative exponent represents division (the reciprocal of the base raised to the absolute value of the exponent), and an exponent of zero will always result in 1, provided the base is not zero, as any non-zero number raised to the power of zero is defined to be 1.\n\nIt's important to consider edge cases when using this function. For example, if both the base and the exponent are zero, this is an indeterminate form in mathematics and may lead to undefined or implementation-specific results depending on the programming environment or library used. Additionally, the precision and range of the calculated result may be constrained by the data type or the system's floating-point arithmetic capabilities.\n\nUsage Example: \n```python\n# Calculate 3 raised to the power of 4\nresult = power_function(3, 4)\nprint(result)  # Output will be 81\n```\n\nIn this example, the `power_function` takes `3` as the base and `4` as the exponent, resulting in a calculation of 3 * 3 * 3 * 3, which equals 81.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"base": {"type": "integer", "description": "The base number."}, "exponent": {"type": "integer", "description": "The exponent."}, "mod": {"type": "integer", "description": "The modulus.

This process involves building an ensemble of decision trees, where each tree is trained on random subsets of the available data. The aim of the Random Forest algorithm is to improve predictive accuracy and control overfitting by combining the outputs of multiple decision trees to make a final decision. \n\nWhen using this function, users must specify various parameters that affect the training process. These parameters typically include the number of trees in the forest, which controls the number of decision trees that will be generated and trained. Another parameter is the maximum depth of each tree, which determines how deep each individual tree can grow before it is pruned. Users may also set criteria for splitting nodes during the tree growing process, which affects how data points are divided within each tree.\n\nAdditionally, users can specify parameters related to the randomness aspect of the forest, such as the size of the random samples taken for each tree. These random samples can be drawn with or without replacement, and this choice can influence the diversity of the ensemble. Other optional parameters may include the minimum number of samples required to split a node and the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node, both of which impact the complexity of the individual trees.\n\nAn edge case to consider when using this function is when the number of trees specified is too low, which might not provide sufficient ensemble diversity, leading to poor generalization performance. Conversely, specifying an excessively high number of trees can increase computational time without significant gains in accuracy.\n\nFor practical usage, consider a scenario where a dataset with labeled examples is available.

This metric is widely used to assess whether a person is within a healthy weight range for their height. The calculation is based on the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{BMI} = \\frac{\\text{weight in kilograms}}{\\text{(height in meters)}^2} \\]\n\n### Parameters:\n\n- **Weight**: This is the body weight of the individual and should be provided in kilograms. It is important to ensure the weight value is accurate to obtain a reliable BMI result.\n  \n- **Height**: This refers to the height of the individual and should be measured in meters. Accurate height measurement is crucial as it is squared in the formula, thus amplifying any errors in measurement.\n\n### Edge Cases and Considerations:\n\n- **Units**: The function expects weight in kilograms and height in meters. If the input values are in different units, they must be converted to the appropriate units before calculation.\n  \n- **Zero or Negative Values**: Inputs for weight or height that are zero or negative are invalid, as they do not represent realistic or possible physical measurements. The function should handle such cases, potentially by raising an error or returning a meaningful message indicating invalid input.\n\n- **Precision**: The result may be rounded to a reasonable number of decimal places (commonly one or two) to make it more understandable while maintaining necessary precision for health assessments.\n\n### Usage Example:\n\nTo use this function, you would provide the weight and height of the individual. For instance, if a person weighs 70 kilograms and their height is 1.75 meters, the function call would look like this:\n\n```python\nbmi = calculate_bmi(70, 1.75)\n```\n\nThis would compute the BMI by substituting these values into the formula, resulting in a BMI of approximately 22.86, which typically falls within the 'normal weight'", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"weight": {"type": "integer", "description": "The weight of the person in kilograms."}, "height": {"type": "integer", "description": "The height of the person in centimeters."}, "system": {"type": "string", "description": "The system of units to be used, 'metric' or 'imperial'.

Each of these parameters plays a crucial role in determining the overall market value of the property.\n\n- **Number of Bedrooms**: This parameter indicates the total count of bedrooms within the house. It is a significant factor as it often influences family size accommodation and, consequently, the house's market appeal and price.\n  \n- **Number of Bathrooms**: This parameter reflects the number of bathrooms available in the house. Properties with more bathrooms may offer greater convenience and luxury, thus potentially commanding a higher market price.\n  \n- **Area**: This parameter specifies the total livable or usable area of the house. Generally, properties with a larger area are valued higher due to the increased space they offer, which is attractive to buyers looking for spacious living environments.\n\nThe function processes these inputs to output an estimated price value. The price prediction could be based on historical data, real estate market trends, and perhaps other underlying statistical models or algorithms that consider these factors. The model might also account for regional variations in property values due to location desirability.\n\nUsage Example: To estimate the price of a house with 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, and a total area of 2,000 square feet, you would input these values into the function. The function then analyzes these inputs and yields a predicted market price for the property.\n\nThis predictive function is beneficial for potential buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals, providing them with an estimate to facilitate informed decision-making in property transactions.

This method is particularly useful for applications that require organizing a large number of queries systematically, such as natural language processing tasks, chatbots, or automated customer service systems.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- If no queries are provided for a given intent, the function will simply record the intent with an empty list of queries, ensuring that all intents are processed but without any associated data.\n  \n- If duplicate queries are provided under the same intent, the function will still record each instance, as this might be intentional depending on the use case (e.g., tracking frequency of certain queries).\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\n# Example of how to call the function with multiple intents and their associated queries\nrecord_classifications(\n    greeting=[\"Hello\", \"Hi there\", \"Good morning\"],\n    farewell=[\"Goodbye\", \"See you later\", \"Take care\"],\n    inquiry=[\"What's the weather", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["acc_routing_start", "atm_finder_start", "faq_link_accounts_start", "get_balance_start", "get_transactions_start", "outofscope"], "properties": {"acc_routing_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries requesting the bank routing numbers or account numbers."}, "atm_finder_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for locations of ATMs, specified in the format of 'City, State (abbr)', such as 'Berkeley, CA' or 'New York, NY'."}, "faq_link_accounts_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to linking accounts within the bank's system."}, "get_balance_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for account balances, available funds, or other financial balances."}, "get_transactions_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to viewing transactions, deposits, purchases, and transaction details."}, "outofscope": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries that do not classify to any other available intents."}}}}, {"name": "record2", "description": "Records classifications for a series of queries based on the intent names provided as keyword arguments.

A 2x2 contingency table is a type of table that displays the frequency distribution of variables. It typically categorizes two different categorical variables, each having two levels or values, allowing for statistical analysis of whether these two variables are independent or associated.\n\nThe Chi-Squared test for independence is a statistical hypothesis test intended to determine if there is a significant association between the two categorical variables. In this context, the null hypothesis posits that the variables are independent, meaning there is no association between the two. Conversely, the alternative hypothesis suggests that the variables are dependent, indicating some form of association.\n\nThe function computes the test statistic by comparing the observed frequencies in each cell of the table with the expected frequencies under the assumption of independence. The expected frequencies are calculated based on the marginal totals of the table. The resulting test statistic follows a chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom, considering the contingency table's 2x2 nature.\n\nWhen executing this function, it is crucial to ensure that the data adheres to the assumptions of the Chi-Squared test, particularly that the observations are independent, and the expected frequency in each cell should preferably be at least 5 to ensure the validity of the test results. If these conditions are not met, the results may be unreliable, and alternative statistical methods might be required.\n\nThe output of this function typically includes the chi-squared test statistic and the corresponding p-value. The p-value is used to determine statistical significance; a common threshold for significance is 0.05.

Each of these inputs provides important information about the house's characteristics that can affect its valuation.\n\n1. **Area of the House**: This parameter represents the total square footage or square meters of the house. Generally, larger homes are valued higher because they offer more living space. The function uses this data to assess how the size of the living area contributes to the overall price of the house.\n\n2. **Number of Rooms**: This input specifies how many separate rooms are in the house, including bedrooms, living rooms, kitchens, and bathrooms. More rooms can indicate a more versatile and potentially more valuable property. The function considers the number of rooms as a key component in determining the price, as it can reflect the house's capacity to accommodate residents or activities.\n\n3. **Year of Construction**: This factor provides insight into the age of the house, which can impact its condition, style, and appeal. Older homes may have historical value or require more maintenance, while newer homes might feature modern designs and efficient systems. The function incorporates the year of construction to gauge how the house's age and potential renovations affect its market value.\n\nBy processing these inputs, the function predicts a price that reflects the combination of space, usability, and age-related attributes. It is intended to help potential buyers, real estate agents, and property investors make informed decisions by providing an estimated valuation based on standard real estate metrics.

The NPV calculation is fundamental in financial analysis as it aids in determining the value of an investment by discounting future cash flows to their present value, thereby allowing for an assessment of profitability.\n\nTo perform this calculation, the function requires a series of cash flows, which are usually represented as a list or an array, where each element corresponds to a cash flow occurring at a specific time period. These cash flows may include both incoming cash, such as revenue, and outgoing cash, such as expenses or initial investments.\n\nThe function also requires an interest rate, often called the discount rate, which is a critical parameter in the NPV calculation. The discount rate reflects the time value of money, risk associated with the investment, and opportunity cost. It's used to discount future cash flows back to their present value, providing a comprehensive view of the project's worth today.\n\nFor each cash flow in the series, the function applies the formula for Net Present Value: NPV = \u03a3 (C_t / (1 + r)^t), where C_t represents the cash flow at time t, r is the discount rate, and t is the time period. This formula ensures that each future cash flow is appropriately adjusted for the time value of money.\n\nEdge cases to consider when using this function include scenarios where cash flows are zero or negative across all periods, which would result in an NPV of zero or a negative value, respectively.

It bases its calculations on three key financial inputs: the purchase price of the stock, the sale price of the stock, and any dividends received during the holding period of the investment. By taking these inputs into account, the function provides a comprehensive measure of the investment's profitability over time.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **Purchase Price**: This is the initial cost at which the stock was bought. It represents the amount paid per share at the time of investment. The purchase price is a crucial input since it forms the baseline against which the sale price is compared to determine capital gains or losses.\n\n2. **Sale Price**: This is the price at which the stock is sold. It indicates the per-share amount received upon selling the stock. The sale price is compared to the purchase price to calculate the gain or loss from the investment. A higher sale price relative to the purchase price suggests a capital gain, whereas a lower sale price implies a capital loss.\n\n3. **Dividends Received**: These are the total dividends paid to the investor during the period the stock was held. Dividends are distributions of a portion of a company's earnings to its shareholders and are considered an integral part of the ROI calculation as they contribute directly to the investor's profit.\n\n#### Calculation:\n\nThe ROI is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROI} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{(Sale Price - Purchase Price) + Dividends Received}}{\\text{Purchase Price}} \\right) \\times 100 \\% \\]\n\nThis formula allows the investor to see the percentage return achieved on the stock, taking into account both the capital gain/loss and any additional income from dividends.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose an investor buys a stock for $100 per share.

It utilizes three primary input parameters: the yearly yield, the investment amount, and the time period. Here is a detailed breakdown of each component involved in the calculation:\n\n1. **Yearly Yield**: This parameter represents the rate of return that the mutual fund is expected to generate annually. It is typically expressed as a percentage. The yearly yield is crucial as it directly impacts the growth rate of the investment over time. For example, a yearly yield of 5% suggests that the fund is projected to grow by 5% each year.\n\n2. **Investment Amount**: This specifies the initial sum of money that is invested in the mutual fund. It is an essential input because the final estimated return is proportional to the amount of capital invested. A higher investment amount will generally result in a higher estimated return, assuming the yield and time period remain constant.\n\n3. **Time Period**: This parameter indicates the duration, usually measured in years, for which the investment is held in the mutual fund. The time period is significant because the effect of compounding can increase the return over longer durations. For instance, leaving the investment for a longer period can lead to a greater cumulative return due to the compounding effect on the yearly yield.\n\nThe function processes these inputs to estimate the total return at the end of the specified time period. It assumes that the yearly yield is consistent throughout the investment period and that there are no additional contributions or withdrawals from the original investment amount during this time.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\nTo understand how this function operates, consider the following example:\n\nSuppose you are assessing the potential return on a mutual fund with a yearly yield of 7%, an initial investment amount of $10,000, and a time period of 5 years.

The primary purpose of this function is to run commands directly in the operating system's command-line interface (CLI), which is generally the Command Prompt on Windows.\n\nA notable feature of this function is its ability to execute not just a single command, but also multiple commands chained together. This chaining is accomplished using the '&&' operator, which allows for the sequential execution of commands. When commands are chained with '&&', each subsequent command will only execute if the preceding command has completed successfully.

A return code of `0` typically indicates that the command was successful, while a non-zero return code indicates an error occurred during execution. This return value can be used to perform further error handling or logging within your program.

For complex tasks, create and run a .bat file.This function is designed to execute a specified command by utilizing the `os.system()` function, which is native to Python's standard library and specifically caters to operations within Windows operating systems. The primary role of this function is to send a command-line instruction directly to the Windows shell for execution. When dealing with multiple commands that need to be executed in sequence, you should separate each command with the '&&' operator.

It is a critical factor, as greater distances typically result in higher emissions.\n\n2. **Fuel Type**: The type of fuel the vehicle uses significantly impacts the calculation. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, electric, and hybrid options. Each fuel type has a specific carbon emissions factor, which denotes the amount of carbon dioxide produced per unit of fuel consumed. This emissions factor is essential for accurately estimating the vehicle's carbon footprint.\n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency**: This represents how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel, usually expressed in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). Higher fuel efficiency indicates that the vehicle can travel further on a smaller amount of fuel, potentially reducing the total emissions.\n\n**Calculation Process:**\n\nThe function combines these parameters to estimate the annual carbon dioxide emissions.

By leveraging this function, users can efficiently narrow down their search for entertainment or cultural activities that match their interests and are conveniently located.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **Genre (string):** This parameter represents the category or type of event the user is interested in. It could be a music genre like rock, pop, or jazz, a type of performance such as theater or dance, or any other classification that defines the style or nature of the event.\n- **Location (string):** This parameter specifies the geographical area where the user wishes to find upcoming events. It can be a city, town, or even a specific venue within a larger area. By providing this, the user ensures that the search results are relevant and accessible.\n\n#### Functionality:\nUpon execution, the function searches through a database or an event listing service to retrieve a list of events that meet the specified criteria. The search results are filtered to include only those events whose genre matches the input genre parameter and whose venue or occurrence falls within the designated location parameter.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- If the specified genre does not match any events in the database, the function may return an empty list or a message indicating no events are available in that genre.\n- If the location input does not correspond to any known place or is outside the coverage area of the event database, the function might also return no results or prompt the user to enter a valid location.\n- The function might need to handle cases where the genre or location parameters are left empty or contain invalid characters, providing appropriate error messages or defaults.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nFor instance, if a user wishes to find jazz concerts happening in New York City, they would input \"jazz\" as the genre and \"New York City\" as the", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"location": {"type": "string", "description": "The city and state where the search will take place, e.g. New York, NY."}, "genre": {"type": "string", "description": "The genre of events."}, "days_ahead": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of days from now to include in the search.", "default": 7}}, "required": ["location", "genre"]}}, {"name": "event_finder.find_upcoming2", "description": "Find upcoming events of a specific genre in a given location.Example: event_finder.find_upcoming(location='Los Angeles, CA', genre='rock')  \nExample: event_finder.find_upcoming(location='Chicago, IL', genre='jazz', days_ahead=14)  \nExample: event_finder.find_upcoming(location='New York, NY', genre='theater', days_ahead=30)  \nExample: event_finder.find_upcoming(location='Austin, TX', genre='country')", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"location": {"type": "string", "description": "The city and state where the search will take place, e.g. New York, NY."}, "genre": {"type": "string", "description": "The genre of events."}, "days_ahead": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of days from now to include in the search.", "default": 7}}, "required": ["location", "genre"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\n[{'func_name': 'event_finder.find_upcoming1', 'params': {'location': 'New York', 'genre': 'rock', 'days_ahead': 30}}]", "possible_answer": [{"event_finder.find_upcoming1": {"location": ["New York", "New York, NY", "NYC"], "genre": ["Rock", "rock"], "days_ahead": [30]}}, {"event_finder.find_upcoming2": {"location": ["New York", "New York, NY", "NYC"], "genre": ["Rock", "rock"], "days_ahead": [30]}}, {"event_finder.find_upcoming3": {"location": ["New York", "New York, NY", "NYC"], "genre": ["Rock", "rock"], "days_ahead": [30]}}]}

The function operates by filtering movies based on three primary attributes: the director of the movie, the genre, and members of the cast. Each of these attributes plays a crucial role in the search query to ensure that the results align closely with the user's interests.\n\n#### Parameters:\n1. **Director**: The name of the director is a key parameter for this function. It allows the user to filter movies directed by a particular filmmaker, enabling them to explore a director's body of work or discover new films by a director they admire.\n\n2. **Genre**: This parameter allows the user to specify the type or category of movie they are interested in. Whether the user is in the mood for a comedy, drama, action, thriller, or any other genre, this filter ensures that the movies retrieved align with the specified genre preference.\n\n3. **Cast**: Users can specify one or more actors or actresses to filter movies featuring these cast members. This is particularly useful for fans of specific performers who wish to explore their filmography or discover new works they have participated in.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nSuppose a user wishes to find movies directed by \"Christopher Nolan,\" within the \"Science Fiction\" genre, and starring \"Leonardo DiCaprio.\" By inputting these criteria into the function, the user would receive a list of movies that match all these attributes, such as \"Inception.\" This ensures a highly personalized and relevant movie discovery experience.\n\n#### Considerations:\n- If a user specifies only one or two of the parameters, the function will still retrieve movies based on the available criteria, thereby offering flexibility in how the search is conducted.\n- In cases where no movies match all the criteria provided, the function should ideally return an empty list, indicating that no such films are found within the database or collection being queried.\n\nThis functionality is particularly useful", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": [], "properties": {"directed_by": {"type": "string", "description": "Director of the movie.

By leveraging the powerful search capabilities of Spotify, the function allows users to input a query that can include parts of the song title, artist name, album, or other related metadata. Upon receiving the query, the function initiates a search within Spotify's extensive music library to find the best match or list of matches that correspond to the user's input.\n\nOnce the function identifies the correct song from the search results, it proceeds to play the song through the Spotify platform. The function ensures that the song is played using the user's Spotify account, provided that the account is authenticated and has the necessary permissions to play music through the service.\n\n#### Parameter Explanation\n\n- **query**: The query parameter is a string that represents the search term or terms the user wishes to use to find a song on Spotify. This can be a fragment or complete song title, the artist's name, album name, or a combination thereof. The query should be formulated to maximize the accuracy of the search results.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\nSuppose a user wants to listen to \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by Queen. The user can call the function with the query parameter set to \"Bohemian Rhapsody Queen\" or simply \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" to search for the song. The function will then search Spotify's library, identify the track, and proceed to play it.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n\n- If the query does not correspond to any identifiable song, the function should handle this scenario gracefully, possibly by returning an error message or prompt indicating that no match was found.\n- If multiple songs match the query closely, the function may either play the first result or prompt the user to choose from a list of possible matches.\n- The function requires an active internet connection and a valid Spotify account with streaming permissions to function correctly.

In a major scale, the third chord is typically a minor chord; however, this function specifically targets major chords in the key, which may require adjustments to align with the theoretical structure of major chord construction.\n\nThe function then constructs the chord by selecting the appropriate notes, typically the root, major third, and perfect fifth intervals from the scale. For instance, in the key of C major, while the third scale degree (E) forms an E minor chord, the function would adjust this to find the relevant major chord within the key.\n\nEdge cases include keys with sharps or flats, where the note selection must accurately reflect the key signature to ensure the correct chord is generated. An example usage of the function might be `calculateThirdMajorChord('G')`, where the key of G major is passed as an argument, and the function returns the third major chord relevant to that key.\n\nOverall, this function is a useful tool for musicians or composers who need to quickly identify and construct the third major chord within any given key, ensuring that the chord aligns with traditional harmonic principles.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"key": {"type": "string", "description": "The key of the scale."}, "type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of the scale, either major or minor.

The batting average is determined by dividing the player's total number of hits by their total number of official at-bats. \n\n### Parameters:\n- **hits** (int): This parameter represents the total number of successful hits made by the player during their at-bats. A hit is counted when the player successfully reaches at least first base after hitting the ball into fair territory, without the benefit of an error or a fielder's choice.\n- **at-bats** (int): This parameter denotes the player's official number of at-bats. An at-bat is generally counted each time the player steps up to the plate and either reaches base via a hit, makes an out, or rarely, due to certain other exceptions like a sacrifice fly.\n\n### Calculation:\nThe batting average is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Batting Average} = \\frac{\\text{Hits}}{\\text{At-Bats}} \\]\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- If the number of at-bats is zero, the function should handle this to avoid division by zero, which would otherwise result in an undefined value. In such a scenario, the batting average can be considered as `0` or handled by returning a message or a special value indicating that the calculation cannot be performed.\n\n### Usage Example:\nSuppose a player has made 50 hits in 150 at-bats. To calculate the batting average, the function will perform the following operation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Batting Average} = \\frac{50}{150} = 0.333 \\]\n\nThe calculated batting average, in this instance, would be 0.333, often expressed as .333 when represented in typical baseball statistics, indicating that the player successfully hits the ball 33.3% of the time they are at bat.

In the classic scenario, each die has six faces, numbered from 1 to 6, and the total possible outcomes for rolling two dice is 36, since each die operates independently. The function determines how likely it is to achieve a particular sum by considering the different combinations of numbers on the dice that can produce that sum.\n\nFor example, if you want to calculate the probability of rolling a sum of 7, you consider the combinations: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), and (6,1). There are six combinations that result in a sum of 7, making it the most common outcome when rolling two dice. To find the probability, the function divides the number of successful combinations by the total number of possible outcomes (36). Hence, the probability of rolling a 7 is 6/36 or 1/6.\n\nIt's important to note edge cases such as the smallest possible sum (2), which can only be achieved with the combination (1,1), and the largest sum (12), achieved with the combination (6,6). These sums have only one combination each, resulting in a probability of 1/36. This function is particularly useful for strategic decision-making in games by helping players understand the likelihood of certain outcomes based on the roll of the dice.\n\nTo use this function effectively, you input the desired sum, and it outputs the probability as a fraction or a decimal.

A full house is a hand consisting of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank, such as three 10s and two 8s. The calculation involves determining the number of ways to draw such a hand from a 52-card deck.\n\nTo achieve this, the function first calculates the number of ways to choose a rank for the three-of-a-kind portion of the hand, which can be done in 13 ways (one for each rank). For each chosen rank, there are \\(\\binom{4}{3}\\) ways to select three cards of that rank, since there are four suits in a deck.\n\nNext, the function calculates the number of ways to choose a different rank for the pair portion of the hand, which can be done in 12 ways (since one rank is already used for the three-of-a-kind). For each chosen rank for the pair, there are \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) ways to select two cards from the four available suits.\n\nThe total number of full house combinations is then given by multiplying these possibilities: \\(13 \\times \\binom{4}{3} \\times 12 \\times \\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nFinally, to find the probability, this total is divided by the total number of 5-card hand combinations from a 52-card deck, which is \\(\\binom{52}{5}\\).\n\nAn edge case to consider is ensuring the distinction between the rank chosen for the three-of-a-kind and the rank chosen for the pair, as they must be different.

This parameter is crucial as it narrows down the search to a specific geographic location, ensuring that the recommendations are relevant to the user's needs.\n\n- The second parameter, `review_rate`, is a numeric value that determines the minimum average review rating that a sushi place must have to be considered in the results. This parameter helps filter out sushi restaurants that do not meet a certain quality standard, as perceived by previous customers. It ensures that only sushi places with a review rating equal to or higher than this specified value are included in the final output.\n\n- The third parameter, `top number`, is an integer that indicates the number of top sushi places to return. This parameter allows users to limit the number of results based on their preference. For example, if a user only wants to see the top 5 sushi places, they would set this parameter to 5. The function then provides a list containing the specified number of sushi restaurants, ranked according to their ratings and other relevant criteria.\n\nBy combining these parameters, the function is able to generate a tailored list of sushi restaurants that are highly regarded within the specified city and meet or exceed the given review rate.

It calculates the total time needed based on a standard cooking guideline to ensure the chicken is fully cooked and safe to eat. The function takes into account the weight of the chicken and uses a predetermined cooking formula to return the total cooking time.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **weight** (float or int): The weight of the chicken in pounds or kilograms. It is crucial that the weight is accurately provided, as the cooking time is directly proportional to this value. The function assumes that the weight is a positive number.\n\n#### Calculation Details:\nThe function typically employs a rule of thumb where the chicken is roasted at a standard temperature (e.g., 350\u00b0F or 180\u00b0C). For instance, a common guideline might be to cook the chicken for a baseline time of 20 minutes per pound, plus an additional 15 minutes for overall cooking. However, specific formulas may vary according to regional cooking standards or personal preferences, so it's important to adjust as needed.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- If the weight is extremely low (e.g., less than 2 pounds), the function should ensure that the calculated time does not fall below a minimum safe cooking threshold (e.g., 45 minutes), to ensure that the chicken is adequately cooked.\n- For unusually high weights, the function should account for variations in oven performance and potentially recommend checking the internal temperature of the chicken to confirm doneness.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n```python\ndef calculate_cooking_time(weight):\n    # Example guideline: 20 minutes per pound plus 15 minutes\n    time_per_pound = 20  # minutes\n    additional_time = 15  # minutes\n    total_time = (weight * time_per_pound) + additional_time\n    return total_time\n\n# Example usage:\nchicken_weight = 5  # pounds\ncooking_time = calculate_cooking_time(chicken_weight)", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"weight_kg": {"type": "float", "description": "The weight of the chicken in kilograms."}, "cooking_method": {"type": "string", "description": "The method of cooking, defaults to 'roast'."}, "temp_celsius": {"type": "integer", "description": "The cooking temperature in degrees celsius, defaults to 180."}}, "required": ["weight_kg"]}}, {"name": "calculate_cooking_time2", "description": "Calculate the cooking time for a roast chicken.Example: calculate_cooking_time(weight_kg=1.5) returns 90.\n\nExample: calculate_cooking_time(weight_kg=2.0, cooking_method='grill') returns 100.\n\nExample: calculate_cooking_time(weight_kg=1.8, cooking_method='roast', temp_celsius=200) returns 85.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"weight_kg": {"type": "float", "description": "The weight of the chicken in kilograms."}, "cooking_method": {"type": "string", "description": "The method of cooking, defaults to 'roast'."}, "temp_celsius": {"type": "integer", "description": "The cooking temperature in degrees celsius, defaults to 180."}}, "required": ["weight_kg"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\nTo calculate the cooking time for a 1.5 kg roast chicken, we can use the `calculate_cooking_time1` function with the weight parameter set to 1.5 kg.\n\n[calculate_cooking_time1(weight_kg=1.5)]", "possible_answer": [{"calculate_cooking_time1": {"weight_kg": [1.5], "cooking_method": ["", "roast"], "temp_celsius": ["", 180]}}, {"calculate_cooking_time2": {"weight_kg": [1.5], "cooking_method": ["", "roast"], "temp_celsius": ["", 180]}}, {"calculate_cooking_time3": {"weight_kg": [1.5], "cooking_method": ["", "roast"], "temp_celsius": ["", 180]}}]}

The primary purpose of the function is to book a room of a specified type at a particular hotel for a defined number of nights, beginning from a specific start date.\n\nWhen using this function, the user must provide several key pieces of information. First, the user must specify the type of room they wish to book. This may include options such as single, double, suite, or any other available room type that the hotel offers. The precise room type must be known beforehand to ensure availability and to meet the user's preferences.\n\nNext, the function requires the user to specify the exact hotel where they intend to book the room. This is crucial, as the same room type might be available in multiple hotels, and the user needs to clearly indicate which hotel they prefer. The hotel name or identifier should correspond to a valid entry in the hotel's system.\n\nAdditionally, the user must indicate the number of nights they wish to stay. This parameter determines the duration of the booking and can influence room availability and overall cost. The user should ensure that the number of nights aligns with their travel plans.\n\nFinally, the function requires a start date for the booking.

This function is particularly useful in real-world scenarios where terrain features such as hills, mountains, valleys, or bodies of water can significantly alter the distance compared to the simple straight-line, or \"as-the-crow-flies,\" measurement.\n\n### Parameters:\n- **location1**: This parameter represents the starting point or the first location for which the distance calculation is required. It is typically provided in a format that includes geographical coordinates, such as latitude and longitude.\n- **location2**: This parameter is the destination or the second location. Similar to location1, it should be specified using geographical coordinates to ensure precise distance computation.\n\n### Calculation Process:\nThe function utilizes a sophisticated algorithm that incorporates topographical data to adjust the basic distance calculation. This adjustment accounts for elevation changes, natural obstacles, and other terrain features that might impact travel distance. For example, if the path between the two locations includes a steep hill, the algorithm will factor in the additional effort required to traverse this terrain, resulting in a longer calculated distance than the straight-line measurement.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- **Flat Terrain**: If the terrain between the two locations is completely flat, the calculated distance will closely resemble the straight-line distance, as there are no additional terrain-based adjustments necessary.\n- **Unusual Terrain**: In cases where the terrain includes extremely unusual features (such as a very high mountain or a deep canyon), the function may require additional data or assumptions to accurately estimate the distance.\n- **Non-Traversable Terrain**: For areas marked as impossible to traverse (such as certain bodies of water without ferries or bridges), the function needs to incorporate known routes around these obstacles.\n\n### Example Usage:\nHere's an example of how this function might be used in a real-world application:\n\n```python\n# Given coordinates for location1 and location2\nlocation1 = (34.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"origin": {"type": "string", "description": "Starting location of the distance measurement."}, "destination": {"type": "string", "description": "Destination location of the distance measurement."}, "consider_terrain": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether to account for terrain in distance calculation, defaults to false."}}, "required": ["origin", "destination"]}}, {"name": "distance_calculator.calculate2", "description": "Calculate the distance between two locations, considering terrain.Example: distance_calculator.calculate(origin=\"New York\", destination=\"Los Angeles\", consider_terrain=True)\n\nExample: distance_calculator.calculate(origin=\"Paris\", destination=\"Berlin\", consider_terrain=False)\n\nExample: distance_calculator.calculate(origin=\"Tokyo\", destination=\"Kyoto\")", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"origin": {"type": "string", "description": "Starting location of the distance measurement."}, "destination": {"type": "string", "description": "Destination location of the distance measurement."}, "consider_terrain": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether to account for terrain in distance calculation, defaults to false."}}, "required": ["origin", "destination"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\ndistance_calculator.calculate2({'origin': 'New York', 'destination': 'Boston', 'consider_terrain': True})", "model_result_decoded": [{"distance_calculator.calculate2": {}}], "possible_answer": [{"distance_calculator.calculate1": {"origin": ["New York", "New York City", "New York City, NY", "New York, NY", "NYC"], "destination": ["Boston"], "consider_terrain": [true]}}, {"distance_calculator.calculate2": {"origin": ["New York", "New York City", "New York City, NY", "New York, NY", "NYC"], "destination": ["Boston"], "consider_terrain": [true]}}, {"distance_calculator.calculate3": {"origin": ["New York", "New York City", "New York City, NY", "New York, NY", "NYC"], "destination": ["Boston"], "consider_terrain": [true]}}]}
