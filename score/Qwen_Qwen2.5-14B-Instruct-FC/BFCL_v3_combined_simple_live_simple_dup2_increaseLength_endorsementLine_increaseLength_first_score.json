The resonant frequency is the frequency at which the circuit naturally oscillates when not being driven by an external source. This frequency is crucial for various applications, including filters, oscillators, and tuners in radio and communication systems.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **Inductance (L):**\n   - **Type:** Float or Double\n   - **Description:** This parameter represents the inductance of the coil or inductor within the LC circuit, measured in henries (H). The value should be positive and non-zero, as a zero or negative inductance is physically meaningless in this context.\n   - **Example:** `0.005` for an inductance of 5 millihenries.\n\n2. **Capacitance (C):**\n   - **Type:** Float or Double\n   - **Description:** This parameter signifies the capacitance of the capacitor in the LC circuit, expressed in farads (F). Similar to inductance, the capacitance must also be positive and non-zero to produce a valid resonant frequency.\n   - **Example:** `0.000001` for a capacitance of 1 microfarad.\n\n#### Return Value:\n\n- **Type:** Float or Double\n- **Description:** The function returns the resonant frequency of the LC circuit, calculated in hertz (Hz). This value is derived using the standard formula for the resonant frequency of an LC circuit, given by:\n  \n  \\[\n  f = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sqrt{LC}}\n  \\]\n\n  Where \\( f \\) is the resonant frequency, \\( L \\) is the inductance, and \\( C \\) is the capacitance.

This constraint is critical for maintaining clear and unambiguous instructions to the appliance, preventing any potential conflicts or errors that might arise from attempting to send multiple commands simultaneously.\n\nThe function takes a parameter representing the command value that needs to be sent. This parameter should be carefully selected to correspond with the predefined set of commands recognized by the appliance. It is essential to refer to the appliance's documentation to understand the range of acceptable command values and their corresponding actions. \n\nFor instance, if the appliance supports commands such as \"turn on,\" \"turn off,\" \"increase temperature,\" or \"decrease temperature,\" the function call should include only one of these command values each time it is used. This ensures that the appliance receives a clear and precise directive, which is critical for its proper functioning.\n\nIn terms of edge cases, the function does not accommodate the transmission of multiple values simultaneously. Attempting to bypass this limitation by concatenating multiple command values into a single parameter is not supported and may result in unexpected behavior. Additionally, sending an unsupported or invalid command value may lead to an error or the appliance ignoring the command altogether.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the function:\n\n```python\n# Example usage:\ncommand_value = \"turn on\"\nsend_command_to_appliance(command_value)\n```\n\nIn this example, the function is called with a single value, \"turn on,\" which instructs the appliance to activate.

The position of the hour hand is determined not only by the hour but also by the minutes that have passed since the beginning of that hour, as the hour hand moves continuously. Specifically, the hour hand moves at a rate of 30 degrees per hour, and therefore, 0.5 degrees per minute. For example, at 3:15, the hour hand is not exactly at the 3 o'clock position but rather slightly ahead, specifically at 97.5 degrees (90 degrees for 3 hours plus an additional 7.5 degrees for 15 minutes).\n\nThe minute hand, on the other hand, moves at a consistent rate of 6 degrees per minute as it completes a full circle, or 360 degrees, every hour. Therefore, at 15 minutes past any hour, the minute hand is positioned at the 90-degree mark.\n\nOnce the positions of both hands are calculated in degrees from the 12 o'clock position, the function determines the angle between these two positions. It considers the smaller angle formed between the hands, as this is typically the angle of interest. In situations where the calculated angle exceeds 180 degrees, the function will instead return the obtuse angle's supplement, ensuring the angle provided is the minimal angle possible in the plane.\n\nThe function must handle various edge cases, such as when the hands overlap at times like 12:00 or 0:00, resulting in an angle of 0 degrees.

It takes into account the yearly yield of the fund, the amount of money invested, and the duration over which the investment is held. By synthesizing these elements, the function provides an estimate of the potential financial return.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **Yearly Yield**: This parameter represents the annual percentage rate at which the mutual fund is expected to grow. It is typically expressed as a percentage. The yearly yield should reflect realistic market conditions and mutual fund performance metrics. For example, a yearly yield of 5% would be input as 0.05.\n\n2. **Investment Amount**: This parameter details the total sum of money that is initially invested into the mutual fund. It is crucial for determining the base from which returns are calculated. The investment amount should be a positive numerical value representing the amount in currency units (e.g., dollars, euros).\n\n3. **Time Period**: This parameter indicates the duration for which the investment is held. The time period is usually expressed in years and should be a positive integer or a decimal value. For instance, an investment period of 5 years could be entered as 5 or 5.0.\n\n#### Calculation Process:\n\nThe function employs the formula for calculating compound interest, adjusted for mutual funds. The estimated return is derived by applying the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Estimated Return} = \\text{Investment Amount} \\times (1 + \\text{Yearly Yield})^{\\text{Time Period}} \\]\n\nThis calculation assumes that the yield is compounded annually, meaning the investment grows at the yearly yield rate each year over the specified time period.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- If the yearly yield is 0, the function should return the original investment amount, as no growth would occur without yield.\n- Negative values for the yearly yield are generally not expected and", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"yearly_yield": {"type": "float", "description": "The yearly yield of the mutual fund as a percentage."}, "investment_amount": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial investment amount in the mutual fund."}, "years": {"type": "integer", "description": "The time period for which the investment is made in years."}}, "required": ["yearly_yield", "investment_amount", "years"]}}, {"name": "estimate_mutual_fund_return2", "description": "Calculate the estimated return on a mutual fund given the yearly yield, the investment amount and the time period.

The `os.system()` function facilitates the execution of commands as if they were being run from the system's command prompt. It is important to note that this function is intended for use within environments that support Windows command syntax.\n\nOne of the core capabilities of this function is to handle not only single commands but also multiple commands. These multiple commands can be executed in sequence by chaining them together using the '&&' operator. The use of '&&' ensures that each command will only execute if the preceding command completes successfully, which is defined by returning an exit status of zero. This feature is particularly useful for scripting and automation tasks where the successful execution of a sequence of commands is vital.\n\nFor example, if you wish to first navigate to a specific directory and then list the contents of that directory, you can achieve this by passing the following string to the function: `\"cd C:\\\\Users && dir\"`. This operation will change the current directory to `C:\\Users`, and if successful, it will subsequently list the contents of that directory.\n\nIt should be noted that the execution of system-level commands through this method is dependent on the permissions of the user and the environment in which the Python script is running. Additionally, care should be taken to validate and sanitize any input that might be executed to avoid potential security vulnerabilities such as command injection.\n\nIn summary, this function leverages `os.system()` to facilitate the execution of both single and multiple system-level commands on Windows, with the ability to chain commands using '&&' to ensure conditional execution based on the success of prior commands.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

This calculation is based on three critical input parameters: the distance traveled by the vehicle in a year, the type of fuel used by the vehicle, and the vehicle's fuel efficiency. \n\nThe first parameter, distance traveled, refers to the total number of miles or kilometers the vehicle covers over the course of a year. This data is essential as it directly impacts the total fuel consumption of the vehicle, which in turn influences the amount of CO2 emissions.\n\nThe second parameter is the fuel type, which specifies the kind of fuel the vehicle uses, such as gasoline, diesel, or alternative fuels like natural gas or electricity. Each fuel type has a distinct carbon emission factor, which determines how much CO2 is released per unit of fuel consumed. For instance, gasoline and diesel have different carbon contents and thus different emission impacts when burned.\n\nThe third parameter, fuel efficiency, indicates how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel, typically expressed as miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). Higher fuel efficiency implies that the vehicle can travel farther on a smaller amount of fuel, thereby reducing the overall CO2 emissions.\n\nBy combining these three parameters, the function calculates the vehicle's total annual CO2 emissions, providing valuable insights for individuals or organizations aiming to monitor and reduce their carbon footprint.

The function performs checks to verify that the selected items are on the restaurant\u2019s menu and that the requested quantities are available for preparation. It may also handle scenarios where a particular item is out of stock or if the specified quantity exceeds the restaurant's capacity at that time. This function is integral to a food ordering system, streamlining the process of ordering from multiple restaurants by compiling all user selections into a single, coherent order request. Here is an example of how this function can be used:\n\n```python\n# Example usage\norder = place_food_order(\n    selected_restaurants=['Italian Bistro', 'Sushi World'],\n    order_items={\n        'Italian Bistro': {'Pizza Margherita': 2, 'Caesar Salad': 1},\n        'Sushi World': {'Dragon Roll': 3, 'Miso Soup': 2}\n    }\n)\n```\n\nIn this example, the user places an order with two selected restaurants, \"Italian Bistro\" and \"Sushi World.\" For \"Italian Bistro,\" they request 2 Pizza Margheritas and 1 Caesar Salad, while for \"Sushi World,\" they order 3 Dragon Rolls and 2 Miso Soups.

The time constraint might include options like under 15 minutes, 30 minutes, or an hour, allowing users to find recipes that fit within their available time frame.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\nSuppose a user follows a vegan diet, is looking for a main course, and only has 30 minutes to prepare a meal. By inputting these criteria into the function, they will receive a list of recipes that are vegan-friendly, classified as main courses, and can be prepared in 30 minutes or less. This feature-rich functionality ensures that the user can efficiently find a recipe that aligns with their dietary needs, recipe preference, and time availability, without having to manually sift through irrelevant options.\n\nThis function is particularly beneficial in diverse scenarios, such as planning meals for family members with different dietary needs, preparing quick", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"dietary_restrictions": {"type": "string", "description": "Dietary restrictions e.g. vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, dairy free."}, "recipe_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of the recipe.
