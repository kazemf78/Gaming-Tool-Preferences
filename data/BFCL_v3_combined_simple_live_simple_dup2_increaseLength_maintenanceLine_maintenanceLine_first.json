It is usually given in meters per second (m/s) or any other unit of velocity. It is crucial to provide this value accurately as it serves as the baseline for computing how the speed of the object changes over time.\n\n- **Acceleration (a)**: Acceleration is the rate at which the velocity of the object changes over time. It is a vector quantity, which means it has both magnitude and direction. Acceleration is measured in meters per second squared (m/s²). Positive acceleration indicates an increase in velocity, while negative acceleration (deceleration) suggests a decrease.\n\n- **Time (t)**: This is the duration for which the acceleration is applied to the object. It is usually expressed in seconds (s). Time is a scalar quantity, solely representing the period over which the change in motion is observed.\n\n#### Formula:\nTo compute the final velocity (v), the function applies the formula:\n\\[ v = v₀ + (a \\times t) \\]\nThis equation assumes that the acceleration is constant over the time period specified.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nSuppose an object starts with an initial velocity of 10 m/s, accelerates at a rate of 2 m/s² for 5 seconds.

This formula is applicable specifically to triangles when the base and height are perpendicular to each other, essentially meaning that the height represents the vertical distance from the base to the opposite vertex. The function takes two primary input parameters: the 'base' and the 'height' of the triangle. Both of these parameters should be positive numerical values, typically represented as either integer or floating-point numbers, to ensure the calculation is meaningful and accurate.

If the input is not a non-negative integer, the function should handle the error either by returning a predefined error message or by raising an exception to alert the user.\n\nUsage example:\n\nIf the function is named `calculate_factorial`, one could call it as follows:\n\n```python\nresult = calculate_factorial(5)\nprint(result)  # Output: 120\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `calculate_factorial` is called with the argument 5, and it returns the factorial of 5, which is 120. The result is then printed to the console.

The angle is calculated in degrees and lies between 0 and 180 degrees, ensuring that the measure is the smallest possible angle rather than the reflex angle.\n\nTo perform this calculation, the function first determines the position of the hour hand based on both the hour and the minute provided. It acknowledges that the hour hand moves as time progresses, not only every hour but also with each passing minute. Specifically, the hour hand moves 0.5 degrees per minute (or 30 degrees per hour). For example, at 3:30, the hour hand is not exactly on the 3 but slightly ahead, at 105 degrees from the 12 o'clock position.\n\nSimilarly, the position of the minute hand is calculated based solely on the minutes given, moving at a rate of 6 degrees per minute.

The function assumes that the dividend payout is distributed evenly across all shares and quarters, which may not account for any mid-year changes in the number of outstanding shares or uneven dividend distributions unless explicitly specified otherwise.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"total_payout": {"type": "integer", "description": "The total amount of dividends paid out in USD"}, "outstanding_shares": {"type": "integer", "description": "Total number of outstanding shares"}}, "required": ["total_payout", "outstanding_shares"], "optional": []}}]}

This calculation involves the following key parameters:\n\n1. **Annual Coupon Payment**: This parameter represents the yearly interest payment made to bondholders, based on the bond's stated coupon rate. It is essential to input this value accurately, as it directly affects the cash flow calculations.\n\n2. **Time Frame**: This parameter indicates the total duration over which the bond will generate cash flows. Typically, this is the bond's maturity period, measured in years. The time frame is used in calculating the present value of each annual cash flow, taking into account the total number of years the bond is expected to pay coupons.\n\n3. **Discount Rate**: The discount rate is a critical factor in the DCF calculation. It represents the rate of return required by investors or the market interest rate. The discount rate is used to bring future cash flows back to their present value, reflecting the time value of money and investment risk. A higher discount rate will reduce the present value of future cash flows.\n\nThe function works by calculating the present value of each individual coupon payment over the specified time frame, using the discount rate to adjust each cash flow to its value in today's dollars.

This metric indicates how effectively the company is using the capital invested by its shareholders to generate profits.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **Net Income**: This is the total profit of the company after all expenses and taxes have been deducted from total revenue. It represents the company's earnings over a specific period, typically a fiscal quarter or year. Net income is a critical input for calculating ROE as it reflects the profitability generated from shareholders' investments.\n\n2. **Shareholder's Equity**: This represents the total equity ownership in the company, which is the residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting liabilities. It includes the amount initially invested by shareholders plus any retained earnings. Shareholder's equity is crucial for the ROE calculation as it forms the denominator in determining how much profit is generated per unit of equity.\n\n3. **Dividends Paid**: These are the distributions made by the company to its shareholders, derived from its net income. While dividends represent a return to shareholders, they are subtracted from net income in certain calculations to reflect the earnings retained in the business. However, in the context of standard ROE calculations, dividends are generally not deducted from net income as ROE typically measures the return on the total equity base rather than retained earnings.\n\n#### Calculation:\n\nThe formula used for calculating Return on Equity is:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Shareholder's Equity}} \\]\n\nThis formula provides a percentage that signifies the return generated on every dollar of equity.

This calculation provides investors with an approximation of the potential gains or returns they might expect over a specified period, assuming constant conditions.\n\n- **Yearly Yield**: This parameter represents the annual percentage return that the mutual fund is expected to generate. It is typically based on past performance or projected future returns and is expressed as a percentage. For instance, a yearly yield of 5% suggests that the investment is expected to grow by 5% each year.\n\n- **Investment Amount**: This is the total initial capital invested in the mutual fund. The function uses this parameter to compute how much the investment will potentially grow over the specified period. For example, an investment of $10,000 acts as the principal amount that will compound according to the yearly yield.\n\n- **Time Period**: This parameter indicates the duration, usually in years, for which the investment will be held in the mutual fund. It determines the number of times the yearly yield will be applied to the investment amount. For example, a time period of 10 years means the investment will compound annually for ten years.\n\nThe function assumes that the yield remains constant throughout the specified period and that no additional investments or withdrawals are made during this time.

It is the starting point of the investment and should be expressed in monetary terms (such as dollars, euros, etc.). The total initial investment serves as the principal amount upon which the yield is calculated.\n\n2. **Annual Yield Rate**: The annual yield rate is expressed as a percentage and represents the expected rate of return on the mutual fund investment each year. The yield is typically calculated on a compounding basis, meaning that the interest earned each year is added to the principal, and in subsequent years, interest is earned on the new total balance, which includes both the principal and the accumulated interest.\n\n3. **Time Period**: This parameter specifies the duration for which the investment is held, expressed in years. The time period determines the number of compounding intervals over which the investment will grow. A longer time period allows the investment to take greater advantage of compounding, potentially leading to a higher final balance.\n\nThe function applies the principles of compound interest to determine the final balance of the mutual fund investment.

Higher input or weight increases firing rate and higher decay rate decreases it.The function calculates the neuronal activity, specifically the rate at which a neuron fires, by taking into account several critical factors: the input synaptic rate, the weight of the inputs, and the decay rate. Each of these parameters plays a vital role in determining the overall firing rate of the neuron.\n\n1. **Input Synaptic Rate**: This is the frequency or rate at which synaptic inputs are received by the neuron. It represents how often the neuron is stimulated by incoming signals from other neurons. A higher input synaptic rate indicates that the neuron is receiving a large number of signals in a given time period, which typically leads to an increase in the neuron's firing rate.\n\n2. **Weight of Inputs**: This parameter measures the strength or influence of the synaptic inputs on the neuron. Each synapse connecting to a neuron can have a different weight, representing its significance. Larger weights signify stronger synaptic connections, thereby increasing the likelihood of the neuron firing. When the weight of inputs is high, even a moderate input synaptic rate can lead to a substantial increase in the firing rate.\n\n3. **Decay Rate**: This represents the rate at which the neuron's firing rate decreases over time in the absence of incoming signals. Essentially, it characterizes how quickly the neuron's activity diminishes when not actively stimulated. A higher decay rate means the neuron's firing rate will decrease more rapidly, effectively counteracting the effects of high input synaptic rates or weights. Thus, an increase in decay rate results in a decrease in the firing rate.\n\nBy considering these parameters, the function computes the neuron's firing rate, balancing the excitation from input synaptic rates and weights against the inhibition from the decay rate. For instance, if a neuron receives a high synaptic input rate and the weights of these inputs are significant, it will fire more frequently unless the decay rate is also notably high, which would reduce the firing rate.

It is typically measured in square units, such as square feet or square meters, depending on the region or preference. The surface area can be calculated based on the dimensions of the area to be painted, such as walls, ceilings, or any surface needing a coat of paint.\n\n2. **Coverage Rate (required input):** This input specifies how much area a single unit (often a gallon or liter) of the paint can cover. The coverage rate is usually provided by the manufacturer and can vary based on paint quality, type, and color. It is usually expressed in square units per unit of paint, indicating the efficiency of the paint in covering surfaces.\n\nThe function uses these inputs to compute the total amount of paint necessary by dividing the surface area by the coverage rate.

When a key is given as input, the function identifies the major scale associated with that key, and then calculates the third chord in the sequence of chords that naturally arise from that scale. In music theory, each key is associated with a specific set of notes that form a major scale, and chords are built from these notes by stacking thirds. The third major chord in this context refers to the chord that is built on the third degree, or note, of the major scale of the specified key.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **key** (string): This parameter represents the musical key in which the chord should be calculated.

For instance, if the input key is \"C\", the major scale would consist of the notes C, D, E, F, G, A, and B.\n\n2. **Identify the Third Scale Degree**: Once the major scale is determined, the function identifies the third note within this scale. Continuing with the example of the key of \"C\", the third note is \"E\".\n\n3. **Construct the Major Chord**: The third major chord is constructed using the third note as the root. A major chord is typically formed by taking the root note, adding the note located a major third above it, and then adding the note a perfect fifth above the root.

This calculation is based on two primary inputs: the player's number of hits and their number of at-bats. \n\nTo compute the batting average, the total number of hits achieved by the player is divided by the total number of at-bats. Mathematically, the formula is expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Batting Average} = \\frac{\\text{Number of Hits}}{\\text{Number of At-Bats}} \\]\n\nThe resulting batting average is a decimal value that typically ranges from 0 to 1, although it is often presented as a three-digit decimal in practice. For example, if a player has 50 hits out of 200 at-bats, the batting average would be calculated as \\( \\frac{50}{200} = 0.250 \\).\n\nIt is important to note that both the number of hits and at-bats must be non-negative integers, and the number of at-bats should be greater than zero to avoid division by zero errors.

This value must be positive and can be adjusted to analyze different periods of performance, whether recent or more extended historical spans.\n\n#### Functionality\nThe function works by accessing a dataset or database that contains detailed records of cricket matches. It retrieves the scores achieved by the specified cricketer in the past number of matches identified. These scores are then summed and divided by the `numberOfMatches` to compute the average. This average provides insight into the player's batting performance over the selected period.\n\n#### Edge Cases and Considerations\n- **Insufficient Data**: If the `numberOfMatches` exceeds the total matches played by the cricketer, the function should handle this gracefully, possibly by limiting the calculation to the available matches and notifying the user.\n- **Data Availability**: Ensure that the function has access to a reliable data source containing comprehensive match records to prevent misinformation.\n- **Error Handling**: The function should include error-checking mechanisms to handle incorrect inputs, such as a non-existent player name or an invalid number of matches (e.g., negative numbers).\n\n#### Usage Example\n```python\n# Example usage of the getAverageBattingScore function\n\n# Calculate the average batting score for 'John Doe' over the last 5 matches", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"player_name": {"type": "string", "description": "Name of the cricket player."}, "matches": {"type": "integer", "description": "Number of past matches to consider for average calculation."}, "match_format": {"type": "string", "description": "Format of the cricket matches considered (e.g., 'T20', 'ODI', 'Test').

In Monopoly and similar games, understanding the likelihood of rolling particular sums can influence strategic decisions, making this function especially useful for players seeking to optimize their gameplay.\n\nThe standard six-sided dice are numbered from 1 to 6. When rolling two such dice, the minimum sum one can achieve is 2 (by rolling a 1 on each die), and the maximum sum is 12 (by rolling a 6 on each die). The function takes as input the desired sum and computes the probability of that sum being rolled based on all possible outcomes when two dice are tossed.\n\nFor instance, if the desired sum is 7, the function will determine the probability by calculating the number of combinations that result in a sum of 7 (i.e., (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), and (6,1)) and dividing by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 36. This is because each die has 6 faces, resulting in 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes when two dice are rolled together.\n\nEdge cases include the smallest and largest possible sums, 2 and 12 respectively, which each have only one possible combination. For example, the sum of 2 occurs only with the roll (1,1), and the sum of 12 occurs only with the roll (6,6).\n\nUsage example:\n- To find out the probability of rolling a sum of 7, you would call the function with the input 7.

It is important to note that the export data generated through this function is stored temporarily and is retained for a maximum period of 7 days. After this period, the data will no longer be available, so it is crucial to access and utilize the export information within this timeframe.\n\n### Parameters:\n\n1. **Bot ID (Optional):** \n   - This parameter specifies the unique identifier of the bot whose exports you want to list. If not provided, the function may default to listing exports associated with all available bots.\n\n2. **Bot Locale (Optional):** \n   - Refers to the specific language or locale of the bot for which you want to list exports. Providing this parameter allows you to narrow down the exports to those associated with the designated locale.\n\n3. **Custom Vocabulary (Optional):** \n   - This parameter indicates whether the exports are linked to a custom vocabulary component within the bot. It is useful when the exports are specifically related to custom defined vocabulary elements.\n\n### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose you are managing a multilingual bot with different locales and custom vocabularies, and you want to list all the exports for the English language locale. You would specify the bot ID and the English locale in the function call.

Returns a list of times in seconds, each representing the occurrence of a significant beat within the audio file.This function is designed to perform a detailed analysis of an audio file with the primary objective of detecting beats. Beats are the rhythmic pulses that occur at regular intervals in a piece of music or audio track, and identifying them accurately is crucial for various applications such as music mixing, tempo estimation, and rhythmic analysis.\n\nThe function begins by examining the entire audio file to identify potential beat occurrences. During this process, it applies an algorithm to detect beats by analyzing the periodic peaks in the audio signal. Once potential beats are identified, the function evaluates each detected beat based on two main criteria: confidence levels and timing.\n\nConfidence levels refer to the likelihood that a detected peak in the audio signal is indeed a beat, as opposed to noise or other audio artifacts. The function uses these confidence levels to filter out any false positives or spurious results, ensuring that only those beats which are most likely to be genuine are considered for the final output.\n\nTiming refers to the precise moments when these beats occur within the audio file. By analyzing the timing, the function ensures that the detected beats align with the expected rhythmic structure of the audio, further refining the results.\n\nAfter filtering the detected beats based on these criteria, the function compiles a list of times, each expressed in seconds. This list represents the occurrence of significant beats within the audio file, providing users with precise timing information that can be used for further analysis or processing.\n\nFor example, if an audio file contains beats at regular intervals of 1 second, and all beats meet the confidence threshold, the function would return a list such as [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, etc.]. However, if some beats do not meet the confidence criteria, they would be omitted from the list.\n\nThis functionality is particularly useful in applications where accurate beat detection is critical, such as creating beat-synchronized visual effects, automated music transcription, or enhancing audio playback experiences.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["capture_percentage", "confidence_window_size"], "properties": {"capture_percentage": {"type": "integer", "description": "Filters beats by excluding those below a specified confidence percentile.

It identifies moments in the audio where beats occur and subsequently evaluates each detected beat against specific criteria, namely confidence levels and timing precision. The confidence level refers to the certainty with which a detected beat is considered accurate, ensuring that only beats with a high probability of correctness are retained. Timing is also crucial, as it ensures that the beats are spaced correctly according to the rhythmic structure of the audio. \n\nAfter analyzing the audio file and applying these filters, the function compiles a list. This list contains the exact times, measured in seconds from the start of the audio file, at which significant beats are detected. These times represent the occurrence of notable beats that passed the filtering criteria.

It prepares data for machine learning models, ensuring numerical values are scaled properly and categorical variables are appropriately transformed.This function serves as a crucial preprocessing step in the pipeline of preparing data for machine learning models. The primary objective of this function is to transform raw input data into a format that can be effectively used by various machine learning algorithms. It achieves this by performing two key operations: normalization of numerical values and encoding of categorical variables.\n\nThe normalization process involves adjusting the scale of numerical features to ensure that they contribute equally to the model's performance. This is particularly important in cases where the numerical features have varying units or magnitudes. By bringing all numerical values to a consistent scale, often within a range such as [0, 1] or having a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, the function helps prevent any single feature from disproportionately influencing the model due to its scale.\n\nIn addition to normalization, this function also addresses categorical variables, which are non-numeric data types that represent categories or labels. Such variables need to be converted into a numerical form before being fed into machine learning models, as these models typically require numerical input. The function accomplishes this transformation through encoding techniques, such as one-hot encoding or label encoding. One-hot encoding transforms each categorical variable into a binary vector, ensuring that the model can understand and process these variables without assuming any inherent order or relationship. Label encoding assigns a unique integer to each category, which can be useful for certain algorithms that can handle ordinal relationships.\n\nBy performing normalization and encoding, the function ensures that the input data is in an optimal condition for training machine learning models, facilitating better performance and accuracy. This preprocessing step is essential for any data pipeline aiming to extract meaningful insights and predictions from data with diverse characteristics.\n\nExample usage:\nSuppose you have a dataset containing both numerical features, such as age and salary, and categorical features, like country or department. This function will normalize the age and salary to a common scale, and encode the country and department into numerical representations, thus making the dataset ready for model consumption.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["data", "normalize", "categories"], "properties": {"data": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "float"}, "description": "A list of numerical values representing the data to be processed.

The function returns the total amount with tax.This function is designed to calculate the applicable sales tax for a specified purchase amount based on the tax regulations of a specific jurisdiction. When the function is called, it requires two primary inputs: the purchase amount and the jurisdiction, which refers to the governmental area (such as a state, province, or country) that has established specific sales tax rules. The function processes these inputs to determine the correct sales tax rate and applies this rate to the purchase amount. \n\nThe function will first identify the correct tax rate associated with the given jurisdiction. It will then compute the sales tax by multiplying the purchase amount by the identified tax rate. Once the sales tax is computed, the function adds this amount to the original purchase amount, thus yielding the total amount that includes both the original purchase and the calculated sales tax. \n\nThe return value of the function is this total amount, inclusive of the sales tax, which represents the final cost the purchaser is required to pay. This function is particularly useful for applications involving financial transactions, where accurate tax calculation is crucial for compliance with local tax laws.\n\nFor instance, if a user inputs a purchase amount of $100 and specifies a jurisdiction with a 7% sales tax, the function calculates a $7 tax. It then adds this tax to the original $100, providing a return value of $107, which represents the total amount due. \n\nIt is important to ensure that the function handles various edge cases, such as jurisdictions with different tax rates, rounding of tax amounts to conform to monetary precision standards, and any jurisdiction-specific exceptions or exemptions that may apply.

This function allows you to run commands as if you were typing them directly into the Windows command prompt. It is versatile in that it can execute simple, standalone commands such as 'dir' to list directory contents or more complex sequences of commands.\n\nWhen executing multiple commands, these can be chained together using the '&&' operator. The '&&' operator is particularly useful because it ensures that each subsequent command is only executed if the preceding command completes successfully without errors. For example, a call to this function with the input `'mkdir new_folder && cd new_folder && echo File created > new_file.txt'` would first attempt to create a new directory named 'new_folder'. If this command succeeds, it will then change the current working directory to 'new_folder'. Finally, if the directory change is successful, it will execute the 'echo' command to create a file named 'new_file.txt' inside the new directory with the text 'File created'.\n\nThis function is predominantly used in scenarios where automated tasks or scripts require the execution of shell commands, such as in deployment scripts, build processes, or other system administration tasks.

When using this function to execute commands, it is important to note that the commands should be formatted as strings. If you need to execute more than one command in sequence, you should separate each command with the '&&' operator. This will ensure that the subsequent command is executed only if the previous one is successful, which is a common practice in shell scripting to maintain workflow integrity.\n\nFor situations where the task at hand involves more complex operations or a sequence of multiple commands that would be cumbersome to manage directly through `os.system()`, it is advisable to create a batch file, commonly referred to as a `.bat` file. A `.bat` file allows you to script a series of commands that can be executed as a single executable task.

The `os.system()` function enables the execution of a command as if it were being run directly from the command line or terminal on a Windows machine. This function is particularly useful for automating tasks that would normally be executed manually.\n\nTo run multiple commands sequentially within a single execution, you can concatenate the desired commands using the '&&' operator, which ensures that each command is executed only if the preceding command completes successfully without any errors. This is a simple and effective way to string together a series of tasks.\n\nHowever, for more intricate or elaborate tasks that require extensive scripting, it is advisable to create a batch (.bat) file. A .bat file allows for a more structured approach to task execution. It can incorporate conditional logic, loops, and other advanced scripting capabilities that extend beyond the straightforward command execution provided by `os.system()`. Once your batch file is ready, you can execute it through the same `os.system()` function by passing the path to the .bat file as a parameter.

The selection process is based on three main parameters: the director, the genre, and the cast. Here’s a more detailed breakdown of these parameters:\n\n- **Director**: The user can specify the name of a director to filter movies that have been directed by this individual. This allows users to find all films associated with a particular director’s style or thematic preference.\n\n- **Genre**: The function accepts a genre parameter, enabling the user to filter movies by specific genres like comedy, drama, action, thriller, etc. This helps in narrowing down the movie list to those fitting a certain mood or thematic category.\n\n- **Cast**: Users can specify one or more cast members as criteria. The function will then retrieve movies that include these actors or actresses, allowing users to explore films that feature their favorite performers.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- **Multiple Criteria**: When multiple criteria are specified, the function applies an AND logic, meaning that only movies satisfying all specified conditions (director, genre, and cast) are included in the results.\n\n- **No Criteria**: If no criteria are specified by the user, the function may return an empty list or a default list of popular or trending movies, depending on the system's configuration.\n\n- **Invalid or Non-existent Criteria**: If the user provides criteria that do not match any movies in the database (e.g., a non-existent director or genre), the function will likely return an empty list, indicating that no movies meet those specifications.\n\n### Usage Example\n\nSuppose a user is interested in finding movies directed by Christopher Nolan, in the genre of science fiction, featuring actor Leonardo DiCaprio.

This ensures that the human agent is fully informed about the user's needs and can provide assistance without requiring the user to repeat information.\n\nFor example, if a user asks a highly specific question about a product feature that is not included in the automated system's database, the function will initiate the transfer process. By doing so, it maintains the quality of customer service and enhances user satisfaction by ensuring that users receive personalized and expert assistance when required. The function thus acts as a critical bridge between automated and human customer support, ensuring comprehensive service coverage.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["statement"], "properties": {"statement": {"type": "string", "description": "The question posed by the user that needs to be transferred to a human agent."}, "urgency": {"type": "string", "description": "The level of urgency for the question to be answered.", "enum": ["low", "medium", "high"], "default": "medium"}, "language": {"type": "string", "description": "The language in which the question is asked, using ISO 639-1 codes (e.g., 'en' for English, 'es' for Spanish)", "default": "en"}}}}]}

It is triggered when the automated system is presented with a question or query that falls outside its programmed knowledge base or predefined response capabilities. The function ensures that users receive the assistance they require by connecting them to a human agent who can provide a more nuanced and comprehensive answer.\n\nWhen this function is invoked, it typically involves assessing the complexity or specificity of the user's inquiry and determining whether it surpasses the system's programmed limits. In such cases, the function initiates the transfer process, which is critical for maintaining customer satisfaction and preventing frustration that might arise from inadequate automated responses.\n\nEdge cases for this function could include scenarios where the question is misinterpreted by the system, leading to a transfer when it might not have been necessary, or situations where network issues could delay the transfer to a human agent. It's essential that these scenarios are considered in the implementation to enhance user experience.\n\nAn example usage of this function could be in a customer support context, where users are interacting with a chatbot to resolve issues related to their accounts. If a user poses a question about a unique billing discrepancy that the chatbot is not equipped to handle, this function would activate, transferring the chat to a human agent who can investigate the issue thoroughly and provide the necessary support.\n\nParameters that might be relevant to this function include the trigger conditions for transfer (e.g., specific keywords or phrases indicating complexity), timeout settings to avoid long waits, and logging capabilities to track and analyze the frequency and reasons for transfers, which can provide insights for future improvements in the automated system's knowledge base.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["statement"], "properties": {"statement": {"type": "string", "description": "The question posed by the user that needs to be transferred to a human agent."}, "urgency": {"type": "string", "description": "The level of urgency for the question to be answered.", "enum": ["low", "medium", "high"], "default": "medium"}, "language": {"type": "string", "description": "The language in which the question is asked, using ISO 639-1 codes (e.g., 'en' for English, 'es' for Spanish).", "default": "en"}}}}]}
