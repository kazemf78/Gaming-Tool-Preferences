If the 'root_type' is explicitly set to 'real', the function will ensure that only real roots are returned.

This means the object is subject only to the acceleration due to gravity, which is a constant value of approximately 9.81 meters per second squared (m/s\u00b2) on the surface of the Earth. The calculation of the final speed is based on the principles of classical mechanics, particularly the equations of motion under uniform acceleration. \n\nIn this scenario, the object starts from rest, meaning its initial speed is zero. As it falls, it accelerates due to gravity until it reaches the ground, at which point its final speed can be determined using the formula derived from the conservation of energy or kinematic equations. Specifically, the final speed \\( v \\) can be calculated using the equation \\( v = \\sqrt{2gh} \\), where \\( g \\) represents the acceleration due to gravity, and \\( h \\) is the height from which the object is dropped.\n\nIt is important to note that the assumption of no air resistance is crucial for this calculation. In reality, air resistance would act against the motion of the object, reducing its acceleration and thus its final speed. However, for the purposes of this function, air resistance is ignored, simplifying the model to an idealized scenario.\n\nUsage example: To find the final speed of an object dropped from a height of 20 meters, the function would take the height as an input and apply the aforementioned equation to compute the final speed. Given the height \\( h = 20 \\) meters and \\( g = 9.81 \\) m/s\u00b2, the final speed would be calculated as \\( v = \\sqrt{2 \\times 9.81 \\times 20} \\), resulting in a specific numerical value for the final speed in meters per second.\n\nThis function is particularly useful for educational purposes, physics simulations, and any applications where an idealized model of free", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"initial_velocity": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial velocity of the object."}, "height": {"type": "integer", "description": "The height from which the object is dropped."}, "gravity": {"type": "float", "description": "The gravitational acceleration.

Additionally, this function does not modify the original list; instead, it returns a new list that reflects the sorted order. \n\nHere is an example of how you might call this function in a program:\n\n```python\n# Assuming 'sort_list' is the name of the function\nnumbers = [4, 2, 9, 1]\nsorted_numbers = sort_list(numbers)  # Sorts in ascending order by default\nprint(sorted_numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 4, 9]\n\n# To sort in descending order\nsorted_numbers_desc = sort_list(numbers, descending=True)\nprint(sorted_numbers_desc)  # Output: [9, 4, 2, 1]\n```\n\nIn this example, the list `numbers` is sorted in ascending order by default. By passing an additional argument, the list can also be sorted in descending order, demonstrating the function's flexibility.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"list": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "float"}, "description": "The list of numbers to be sorted."}, "order": {"type": "string", "enum": ["ascending", "descending"], "description": "Order of sorting."}}, "required": ["list", "order"]}}, {"name": "array_sort2", "description": "Sorts a given list in ascending or descending order.

It operates by taking each user query and analyzing its content to determine the most appropriate predefined category it falls into. The predefined categories are established beforehand, allowing for consistent classification across different queries. Once a category is determined for a query, the function logs both the query and its corresponding category in a systematic manner. This logging process helps in organizing user interactions for further analysis, providing insights into user behavior and preferences. An edge case to consider is when a query does not clearly fit into any predefined category; the function should have a mechanism to handle such scenarios, either by logging it under a 'miscellaneous' category or flagging it for manual review. For example, if a user inputs a query related to \"account settings,\" the function would classify this under a category such as \"User Account Management,\" provided such a category exists among the predefined options. This structured approach to logging ensures that all user queries are documented and classified, facilitating easier access and analysis of user data over time.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["acc_routing_start", "activate_card_start", "atm_finder_start", "auto_loan_payment_start", "bank_hours_start", "cancel_card_start", "card_rewards_start", "cashier_check_start", "clean_goodbye_start"], "properties": {"acc_routing_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries requesting the bank routing numbers or account numbers."}, "activate_card_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries related to activating a new bank card."}, "atm_finder_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries asking for locations of ATMs nearby or in a specific area."}, "auto_loan_payment_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries related to making payments on auto or car loans."}, "bank_hours_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries asking for the working hours or locations of bank branches."}, "cancel_card_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries related to cancelling a bank card or asking for guidance on how to cancel a card."}, "card_rewards_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries related to rewards points or benefits associated with a bank card."}, "cashier_check_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of requests for cashier's checks, drafts, or similar financial instruments from the bank."}, "clean_goodbye_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries saying goodbye or ending the conversation with the chatbot."}}}}, {"name": "record2", "description": "Logs the types of queries users make, classifying them into predefined categories.

This calculation is based on three critical inputs: the initial invested amount, the expected annual return rate, and the number of years the investment will be held. \n\n1. **Invested Amount**: This is the principal sum of money that you are allocating to a particular stock investment. It is typically expressed as a monetary value, such as dollars, and serves as the starting point for the future value calculation.\n\n2. **Expected Annual Return**: This parameter represents the rate at which the investment is anticipated to grow annually. The rate is expressed as a percentage and reflects the average yearly gain that the investment is expected to achieve. It is crucial to note that this is an expected value, meaning it is based on predictions and historical data but is not guaranteed.\n\n3. **Number of Years**: This is the duration for which the investment will be held, measured in years. It determines the time period over which the compound growth will occur. The longer the duration, the greater the potential for the investment to increase in value, assuming a positive annual return rate.\n\nThe function utilizes the formula for compound interest to compute the future value of the investment. The general formula applied is: \n\n\\[ \\text{Future Value} = \\text{Invested Amount} \\times (1 + \\frac{\\text{Expected Annual Return}}{100})^{\\text{Number of Years}} \\]\n\nThis formula takes into account the compounding effect, where the returns earned each year are reinvested to generate additional returns in subsequent years.\n\n**Usage Example**:\n\nConsider an investor who places \\$10,000 in a stock with an expected annual return of 5% for a period of 10 years.

This method provides a straightforward way to invoke operating system commands directly from a Python script. The function can handle both individual commands and sequences of commands that are concatenated using the '&&' operator. The '&&' operator is a standard feature in command-line interfaces that allows the execution of multiple commands in sequence, where each subsequent command is only executed if the previous command is successful (i.e., returns a zero exit status). This capability is particularly useful for constructing complex command sequences that require conditional execution based on the success of prior commands. It is important to note that when executing multiple commands, proper formatting and syntax are essential to ensure that the commands are interpreted correctly by the system.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.The function is designed to execute system-level commands by leveraging the `os.system()` function available within the Python programming language, specifically tailored for usage on Windows operating systems. This function provides the capability to run commands directly in the Windows command shell (cmd.exe), thereby allowing interaction with the operating system's command-line interface from within a Python script.\n\nWhen utilizing this function, users can execute a single command to perform a specific task. For example, a simple command like \"dir\" can be executed to list the directory contents. Additionally, the function supports the execution of multiple commands in a single call by chaining them together using the logical 'AND' operator, denoted by '&&'. This means that several commands can be linked in sequence, where each subsequent command will only execute if the previous command completes successfully. For instance, you could chain commands like \"cd C:\\ && dir\" to change directories and then list the contents of the directory, all within a single invocation of the function.\n\nIt is worth noting that the use of '&&' ensures that the subsequent command only runs if the preceding command returns a successful exit status, which is typically zero in the context of most command-line commands on Windows. This feature is particularly useful for scripting and automation tasks where conditional execution of commands is required.\n\nThe os.system() function call will return a status code upon completion, with '0' indicating successful execution and a non-zero value indicating an error or issue during execution.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.This function is designed to execute system-level commands specifically on Windows operating systems. By leveraging the `os.system()` function from Python's `os` module, it allows the execution of a command string as if it were typed directly into the command prompt. This functionality is highly useful for automating command-line tasks or integrating system commands into Python scripts.\n\nThe function can handle not only individual commands but also multiple commands that are chained together using the '&&' operator. This chaining mechanism is particularly advantageous when you need to execute multiple commands in sequence and want subsequent commands to run only if the preceding ones succeed. For example, if you want to change the directory and then list its contents, you could pass a command string like `cd my_directory && dir` to the function. This ensures that the `dir` command will only execute if the `cd my_directory` command is successful.\n\nAn important detail to note is that because this function utilizes the `os.system()` method, it is synchronous, meaning the Python script will wait for the command to complete before moving on to execute the next line of code. Therefore, it is advisable to be cautious with commands that might take a long time to execute, as they will block further script execution until they are completed.\n\nWhen using this function, it is essential to ensure that the command string is properly formatted and valid within the Windows command-line environment. Incorrect commands or improper syntax could lead to errors or unintended behavior. Additionally, since this function executes commands at the system level, it requires appropriate user permissions to succeed, especially for commands that modify system settings or require elevated privileges.\n\nIn summary, this function serves as a versatile tool for executing Windows command-line instructions from within a Python script, providing flexibility to run single commands or multiple commands in a controlled sequence using '&&'.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

For multiple commands, separate them with '&&'. For complex tasks, create and run a .bat file.This function is designed to execute a specified command string by leveraging the `os.system()` function, which is a part of the Python standard library. It is specifically tailored for use on Windows operating systems, providing a streamlined method for executing shell commands directly from a Python script. When using this function to execute multiple commands in a single call, it is necessary to separate each individual command with the '&&' operator. This ensures that the commands are executed sequentially, and the execution of subsequent commands is contingent upon the successful completion of preceding ones.\n\nFor instance, if you wanted to execute two commands, such as navigating to a directory and then listing the files within that directory, you could pass a command string like `\"cd C:\\\\Users\\\\Username\\\\Documents && dir\"` to this function. This would change the current directory and then display the contents of that directory, provided the directory change is successful.\n\nHowever, when dealing with more complex tasks that involve numerous commands, loops, or conditional logic, it is recommended to encapsulate these commands within a batch file (.bat file). A batch file can be created using any text editor by writing the series of commands into a file and saving it with a `.bat` extension. This file can then be executed through the `os.system()` function by specifying the path to the batch file, thereby ensuring that more intricate sequences of operations are handled efficiently and maintainably.\n\nBy structuring the command execution in this manner, the function provides both simplicity for straightforward command execution and flexibility for more sophisticated operations, making it a versatile tool for automation and task management within Windows environments.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The Windows command line instruction(s) to be executed.

These factors include the total distance the vehicle travels over the course of a year, the type of fuel that it uses, and its fuel efficiency rating.\n\n### Parameters:\n\n1. **Distance Traveled**: This parameter represents the total mileage or distance that the vehicle covers within a year. It is typically measured in miles or kilometers. The greater the distance traveled, the higher the likelihood of increased emissions, assuming all other factors are constant.\n\n2. **Fuel Type**: The type of fuel used by the vehicle is a crucial determinant of its CO2 emissions. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, and alternative fuels such as electric or hybrid options. Each fuel type has a different carbon content and emission factor, affecting the overall emissions calculation.\n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency**: Fuel efficiency is usually measured in terms of miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km). It indicates how effectively a vehicle uses fuel. Vehicles with higher fuel efficiency consume less fuel over the same distance, leading to lower carbon emissions.\n\n### Calculation Considerations:\n\n- **Emission Factors**: The function utilizes predefined emission factors that correspond to each fuel type.

It takes a single argument, `query`, which represents the keywords that the user wants to use to find the desired song. These keywords could include the song title, artist name, album, or a combination of these elements.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- `query` (string): This is a required parameter that specifies the search criteria. The function expects a string input that may contain the name of the song, the artist, or any relevant keyword associated with the music track the user wishes to play. The more specific the query, the more accurate the search results will be.\n\n#### Functionality:\n1. **Search Mechanism:** The function initiates a search on the Spotify platform using the provided query. It sends a request to Spotify's search API to retrieve a list of songs that match the given criteria. The search is comprehensive and scans a wide database of music, covering various genres, artists, and albums.\n\n2. **Selection and Playback:** After retrieving the search results, the function selects the most relevant song based on the query. The criteria for selecting the best match could include exact title matches, the popularity of the song, or recency of release. Once the appropriate track is identified, the function sends a command to Spotify to play the song through the user's Spotify account.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- If the query is vague or too broad, the function may return multiple results, and the selection might not always be the user's intended choice.\n- In scenarios where no matches are found for the given query, the function should handle this gracefully, potentially by notifying the user of the issue or suggesting alternative queries.\n- The function assumes that the user is authenticated with Spotify and has an active session for playback to occur.

The primary purpose of this function is to ensure that users are not left without assistance when the automated system reaches the limits of its programmed capabilities.\n\nUpon activation, the function assesses the context of the interaction and promptly initiates the transfer process to a live human agent. This is crucial in maintaining user satisfaction and providing a higher level of support, especially in cases where human judgment or expertise is required to handle more complex inquiries or issues.\n\nFor example, if a customer asks a question outside the scope of the automated system's knowledge base or if the system does not have a pre-defined response, the function will automatically redirect the conversation to a human agent. This can include scenarios such as queries about specific company policies, unique account issues, or anything that requires personalized attention.\n\nBy implementing this function, organizations can ensure a smooth handoff that minimizes user frustration and enhances the overall customer service experience. It is also beneficial in managing situations where an empathetic response or a nuanced understanding of the customer's needs and concerns is necessary, which a human agent is more adept at providing.\n\nThis function may also include mechanisms to alert human agents about the context of the ongoing conversation, ensuring they can pick up where the chat left off without requiring the user to repeat information.

It allows users to specify the key in which they want the scale progression to be constructed, ensuring that the generated sequence of notes adheres to the musical characteristics and signature of that particular key. Furthermore, the function accepts additional parameters to control the tempo and duration of the progression, providing flexibility in how the music is structured over time.\n\nThe \"key\" parameter is crucial as it determines the tonal center of the scale progression, influencing the overall sound and mood of the generated music. The key can be specified in various forms, such as major or minor, and the function will adjust the scale accordingly to fit the defined key signature.\n\nIn addition to the key, the \"tempo\" parameter allows users to set the speed at which the scale progression is played. Tempo is typically measured in beats per minute (BPM), and adjusting this parameter will result in a faster or slower playback of the scale notes, thereby affecting the energy and feel of the progression.\n\nThe \"duration\" parameter controls the length of time over which the scale progression will be generated and played. This allows users to specify how long the music should last, ensuring that the progression fits within the desired time frame for a particular composition or performance.\n\nThis function is versatile and can be utilized in a variety of musical contexts, whether for composing new pieces, practicing musical scales, or creating backing tracks.

It operates based on specific parameters which typically include the weight of the chicken and the desired cooking method or temperature, though the exact variables may vary depending on implementation. The cooking time is essential to ensure that the chicken is neither undercooked, which can pose health risks, nor overcooked, which can affect texture and taste.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **weight (float or int):** The weight of the chicken, usually measured in pounds or kilograms. This is a critical parameter as the cooking time is generally proportional to the weight of the chicken to ensure even and thorough cooking.\n- **method (optional, string):** This may refer to the cooking method or temperature setting, such as \"convection,\" \"standard oven,\" or specific temperature settings in degrees Fahrenheit or Celsius. This helps adjust the time calculation to accommodate different cooking conditions.\n\n#### Details:\n- The function typically calculates the total cooking time by applying a standard rule of thumb, often around 20 minutes per pound at a given temperature, plus an additional fixed time to account for initial heating and resting.\n- Additional adjustments may be made for variables such as whether the chicken is stuffed, as this can increase cooking time.\n- The function might return the total time in minutes or hours, depending on the required precision or user preference.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- **Zero or Negative Weight:** If the weight is zero or negative, the function should handle this gracefully, potentially by returning an error or warning message.\n- **Unusual Cooking Methods:** If an unrecognized method is provided, the function might default to a standard method or alert the user to input a valid option.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nTo calculate the cooking time for a 5-pound chicken using a standard oven, you might invoke the function as follows:\n\n```python\ncooking_time = calculate_cooking_time(weight=5, method=\"", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"weight_kg": {"type": "float", "description": "The weight of the chicken in kilograms."}, "cooking_method": {"type": "string", "description": "The method of cooking, defaults to 'roast'."}, "temp_celsius": {"type": "integer", "description": "The cooking temperature in degrees celsius, defaults to 180."}}, "required": ["weight_kg"]}}, {"name": "calculate_cooking_time2", "description": "Calculate the cooking time for a roast chicken.
