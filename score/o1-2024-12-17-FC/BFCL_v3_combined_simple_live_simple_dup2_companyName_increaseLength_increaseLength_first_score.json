The interval is defined by two points, typically denoted as the lower and upper bounds, and the area under the curve is calculated between these two points. \n\nWhen using this function, it is important to specify the mathematical function accurately, as any errors in definition may lead to incorrect area calculations.

Returns an empty string if the LLM output is 'answer not found'.This function is designed to take the output from a Language Learning Model (LLM) and perform a parsing operation to determine if the generated answer is valid and meaningful. The primary task of this function is to assess the validity of the LLM's response based on specific criteria. In cases where the LLM's output is the phrase 'answer not found', which indicates that the model was unable to produce a meaningful answer to the query, the function will return an empty string (\"\"). This behavior ensures that any subsequent processing logic can easily identify situations where the model failed to generate a valid response. \n\nThe function does not simply return the answer as is; instead, it incorporates a conditional check to filter out instances of 'answer not found'. By doing so, it provides a mechanism to handle cases where the LLM's response does not contribute valuable information. This feature is particularly useful in applications where the absence of a valid answer needs to be clearly represented and managed efficiently.\n\n### Usage Example:\nSuppose you have an LLM tasked with answering various questions, and you inquire about a fact that the model cannot verify or does not possess in its training data. If the model responds with 'answer not found', invoking this function will result in the return of an empty string. This allows your application to recognize that the query did not yield a useful answer and can initiate a fallback procedure, such as logging the incident, prompting the user for clarification, or attempting another question.\n\n### Parameters Explanation:\n1. **llm_output**: This is the string output generated by the Language Learning Model in response to a given prompt or question.

Entropy, a measure of disorder or randomness in a system, is a fundamental concept in thermodynamics, particularly in understanding energy distribution and efficiency.\n\n### Parameters\n\n- **initial_temperature (T)**: This parameter represents the constant temperature at which the process occurs. It is crucial that this temperature remains constant throughout the process to ensure it is isothermal. The temperature is generally expressed in Kelvin (K) to maintain consistency with thermodynamic calculations.\n\n- **heat_transfer (Q)**: The heat transferred into or out of the system during the process. For a reversible process, this transfer must occur in such a way that the system remains in equilibrium with its surroundings at every stage. The heat transfer is typically measured in joules (J).\n\n### Calculation Details\n\nThe entropy change for an isothermal and reversible process is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta S = \\frac{Q}{T}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\Delta S \\) is the change in entropy.\n- \\( Q \\) is the heat transferred.\n- \\( T \\) is the constant absolute temperature at which the process occurs.\n\n### Edge Cases and Considerations\n\n- **Zero Heat Transfer**: If the heat transfer (\\( Q \\)) is zero, the change in entropy (\\( \\Delta S \\)) will also be zero. This occurs when no energy enters or leaves the system as heat, which could be a hypothetical scenario in a perfectly isolated system.\n\n- **Negative Heat Transfer**: In cases where heat is removed from the system (\\( Q \\) is negative), the entropy change will also be negative, indicating a decrease in the system's disorder as it loses energy.\n\n- **Temperature Constraints**: The function assumes that the input temperature (\\( T \\)) is", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"initial_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial temperature in Kelvin."}, "final_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The final temperature in Kelvin."}, "heat_capacity": {"type": "integer", "description": "The heat capacity in J/K."}, "isothermal": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether the process is isothermal.

This should also be a floating-point number, with positive values indicating east of the Prime Meridian and negative values west of it.\n\n### Usage Example:\nTo retrieve the current weather data for a city with the coordinates of 40.7128\u00b0 N, 74.0060\u00b0 W (which corresponds to New York City), you would call the function as follows:\n\n```python\nget_current_weather(40.7128, -74.0060)\n```\n\nIn this example, `40.7128` is the latitude and `-74.0060` is the longitude of New York City. The function will return the current weather data for this particular location by querying a weather service, ensuring that the data is both precise and up-to-date. \n\n### Edge Cases:\n- If the provided coordinates point to a location over an ocean or an uninhabited area, the function should handle such scenarios gracefully, potentially returning a message indicating no data is available or defaulting to the nearest land-based weather station.\n- The function needs to account for any limitations in data availability from the weather service, such as temporary outages or service unavailability, and should return an appropriate error message or fallback data if necessary", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["city", "lat", "lon"], "properties": {"city": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the city, such as 'New York, NY'."}, "lat": {"type": "float", "description": "The latitude of the city in decimal degrees."}, "lon": {"type": "float", "description": "The longitude of the city in decimal degrees."}}}}, {"name": "get_weather_by_coordinates2", "description": "Retrieves current weather data for the specified city using its geographical coordinates.

The polynomial function is typically expressed in the standard form, where each term is a coefficient multiplied by the variable raised to an exponent. The user must provide the polynomial, usually as a list or array of coefficients, starting from the highest degree to the constant term.

These limits are numerical values representing the x-coordinates at which the integration starts and ends, respectively.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.The function is designed to execute system-level commands by leveraging the `os.system()` function available within the Python programming language, specifically tailored for usage on Windows operating systems. This function provides the capability to run commands directly in the Windows command shell (cmd.exe), thereby allowing interaction with the operating system's command-line interface from within a Python script.\n\nWhen utilizing this function, users can execute a single command to perform a specific task. For example, a simple command like \"dir\" can be executed to list the directory contents. Additionally, the function supports the execution of multiple commands in a single call by chaining them together using the logical 'AND' operator, denoted by '&&'. This means that several commands can be linked in sequence, where each subsequent command will only execute if the previous command completes successfully. For instance, you could chain commands like \"cd C:\\ && dir\" to change directories and then list the contents of the directory, all within a single invocation of the function.\n\nIt is worth noting that the use of '&&' ensures that the subsequent command only runs if the preceding command returns a successful exit status, which is typically zero in the context of most command-line commands on Windows. This feature is particularly useful for scripting and automation tasks where conditional execution of commands is required.\n\nThe os.system() function call will return a status code upon completion, with '0' indicating successful execution and a non-zero value indicating an error or issue during execution. This return value can be used for error handling and to make decisions based on the success or failure of the command execution.\n\nHere is an example usage of this function:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Execute a single command\nos.system(\"dir\")  # Lists directory contents\n\n# Execute multiple commands chained with '&&'\nos.system(\"cd C:\\\\ && dir\")  # Changes directory to C: and then lists contents\n```\n\nBy understanding these nuances, users can effectively employ this function to automate and control system operations seamlessly from within", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.This function is designed to execute system-level commands specifically on Windows operating systems. By leveraging the `os.system()` function from Python's `os` module, it allows the execution of a command string as if it were typed directly into the command prompt. This functionality is highly useful for automating command-line tasks or integrating system commands into Python scripts.\n\nThe function can handle not only individual commands but also multiple commands that are chained together using the '&&' operator. This chaining mechanism is particularly advantageous when you need to execute multiple commands in sequence and want subsequent commands to run only if the preceding ones succeed. For example, if you want to change the directory and then list its contents, you could pass a command string like `cd my_directory && dir` to the function. This ensures that the `dir` command will only execute if the `cd my_directory` command is successful.\n\nAn important detail to note is that because this function utilizes the `os.system()` method, it is synchronous, meaning the Python script will wait for the command to complete before moving on to execute the next line of code. Therefore, it is advisable to be cautious with commands that might take a long time to execute, as they will block further script execution until they are completed.\n\nWhen using this function, it is essential to ensure that the command string is properly formatted and valid within the Windows command-line environment. Incorrect commands or improper syntax could lead to errors or unintended behavior. Additionally, since this function executes commands at the system level, it requires appropriate user permissions to succeed, especially for commands that modify system settings or require elevated privileges.\n\nIn summary, this function serves as a versatile tool for executing Windows command-line instructions from within a Python script, providing flexibility to run single commands or multiple commands in a controlled sequence using '&&'.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

These factors include the total distance the vehicle travels over the course of a year, the type of fuel that it uses, and its fuel efficiency rating.\n\n### Parameters:\n\n1. **Distance Traveled**: This parameter represents the total mileage or distance that the vehicle covers within a year. It is typically measured in miles or kilometers. The greater the distance traveled, the higher the likelihood of increased emissions, assuming all other factors are constant.\n\n2. **Fuel Type**: The type of fuel used by the vehicle is a crucial determinant of its CO2 emissions. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, and alternative fuels such as electric or hybrid options. Each fuel type has a different carbon content and emission factor, affecting the overall emissions calculation.\n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency**: Fuel efficiency is usually measured in terms of miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km). It indicates how effectively a vehicle uses fuel. Vehicles with higher fuel efficiency consume less fuel over the same distance, leading to lower carbon emissions.\n\n### Calculation Considerations:\n\n- **Emission Factors**: The function utilizes predefined emission factors that correspond to each fuel type.
