Prime factorization is a fundamental operation in number theory, where the goal is to break down a composite number into its prime number components. The function takes a single integer input, which should be a positive integer greater than 1, as prime numbers are defined to be greater than 1.\n\nTo achieve this, the function iteratively divides the input integer by the smallest possible prime number, starting with 2, which is the smallest prime. It repeatedly divides the integer by 2 until it is no longer divisible by 2. Once 2 is no longer a factor, the function proceeds to the next smallest prime number, which is 3, and continues the division process. This process is repeated for succeeding prime numbers (5, 7, 11, etc.) as necessary. For each division, when a prime number successfully divides the integer, the quotient replaces the integer for the next iteration, and the divisor is recorded as a factor.\n\nThis division process continues until the integer is reduced to 1, at which point all prime factors have been identified. The result of the function is typically output as a list or another form of collection of the prime factors, possibly with their respective exponents if a factor is repeated.

This calculation is based on three key inputs: the mass of the substance, the phase transition temperature, and the specific latent heat associated with the particular phase change. The phase changes can include transformations such as melting, freezing, boiling, or condensing.\n\nTo utilize this function effectively, it's important to understand each parameter:\n\n1. **Mass**: This is the amount of the substance, typically measured in kilograms or grams, depending on the system of units being used. The mass of the substance directly influences the total energy involved in the phase change process, as it is directly proportional.\n\n2. **Phase Transition Temperature**: This is the temperature at which the substance changes phases. For example, the melting point of ice is 0\u00b0C, which is the phase transition temperature for ice melting into water. It's crucial to use the correct temperature for the specific phase change being analyzed to ensure accurate energy calculations.\n\n3. **Specific Latent Heat**: This is a property of the substance indicating the amount of energy required to change the phase of a unit mass of the substance without changing its temperature. It is measured in units of energy per mass, such as Joules per kilogram (J/kg). The specific latent heat differs for various materials and processes, such as the latent heat of fusion for melting or freezing and the latent heat of vaporization for boiling or condensing.\n\nThe function calculates the energy by multiplying these parameters.

The population size provides an estimate of the number of individual turtles present, which can be important for conservation efforts, ecological studies, or understanding local biodiversity. The species information identifies the different types of turtles, which helps in recognizing biodiversity levels and could aid in species-specific conservation strategies.\n\n### Parameters:\n- **location**: This should be a precise identifier of the area you are interested in.

It prepares data for machine learning models, ensuring numerical values are scaled properly and categorical variables are appropriately transformed.This function is designed to preprocess the input data, a crucial step in preparing datasets for use in machine learning models. It achieves this by performing two key operations: normalization of numerical values and encoding of categorical variables.\n\nFirstly, the function normalizes the numerical values present in the dataset. Normalization is the process of scaling individual samples to have unit norm, or to fit within a specific range, often 0 to 1, or -1 to 1. This ensures that numerical values are on a comparable scale, which is critical for many machine learning algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of the features, such as k-nearest neighbors or support vector machines.\n\nSecondly, the function encodes categorical variables. Categorical variables are those that represent discrete categories or labels, and they must be transformed into a numerical format that can be interpreted by machine learning algorithms. This transformation can take the form of label encoding, which assigns each category a unique numerical label, or one-hot encoding, which creates binary columns for each category, allowing algorithms to understand categorical data without assuming any ordinal relationship between categories.\n\nBy performing these preprocessing steps, the function ensures that the input data is in a consistent and machine-readable format. This is crucial for the effective training and evaluation of machine learning models, as it prevents issues related to disparate scales or misinterpretation of categorical data. \n\nAn example of usage would involve passing a raw dataset to this function, which would then return a preprocessed version of the data, ready for input into a machine learning model.

These conditions can be a combination of filters, constraints, or rules that the data must satisfy to be included in the query results. Conditions may involve specific values, ranges, or logical expressions that precisely define what subset of the data is required.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose you have a database containing a table of employees, and you want to retrieve details of employees who work in the 'Sales' department and have more than five years of experience. You would use this function by specifying these conditions, transforming them into a query such as:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'Sales' AND Experience > 5;\n```\n\nThe function would then execute this query, returning a collection of records that satisfy these criteria.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- **No Match Found**: If none of the records in the database meet the specified conditions, the function should gracefully handle this by returning an empty result set or an appropriate message indicating that no matching records were found.\n  \n- **Invalid Conditions**: The function should include error handling to manage scenarios where the conditions are improperly formatted or reference non-existent fields. Providing informative error messages can help users correct their inputs.\n\n- **Performance Considerations**: Depending on the complexity of the conditions and the size of the database, executing certain queries might take significant time.

The sine wave is a smooth, periodic oscillation that is fundamental in various fields such as physics, engineering, and signal processing. To use this function effectively, the user must provide two key parameters: the frequency of the sine wave and the range of x-values over which the wave will be plotted.\n\nThe frequency parameter dictates how many complete cycles of the sine wave occur within a unit interval. A higher frequency results in more oscillations appearing in the same interval, while a lower frequency results in fewer oscillations. It is typically expressed in hertz (Hz), which measures the number of cycles per second.\n\nThe range parameter specifies the domain of x-values over which the sine wave is to be plotted. This range is usually defined by a starting point and an ending point, and it determines the length of the x-axis in the plot. The range can be expressed as a tuple or a list, such as (start, end), and should be chosen to effectively capture the details of the sine wave, especially when dealing with high frequencies.\n\nFor instance, if the frequency is set to 1 Hz and the range is specified as 0 to 2\u03c0, the function will plot one complete cycle of the sine wave. On the other hand, setting the frequency to 2 Hz with the same range will result in two complete cycles being displayed within the interval.\n\nUsers should ensure that the range is selected so that it is long enough to adequately visualize the wave, especially for lower frequencies, where the wave's behavior might not be apparent over a short interval.\n\nUsage Example:\n```python\nplot_sine_wave(frequency=5, range=(0, 2*np.pi))\n```\nThis example will generate a plot of a sine wave with a frequency of 5 Hz over the interval from 0 to 2\u03c0 radians, resulting in five complete cycles displayed", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"start_range": {"type": "float", "description": "Start of the range in radians.

The speed calculation is essential for various applications, ranging from basic physics problems to more complex engineering tasks.\n\n### Parameters:\n\n- **Distance (DistanceTravelled):** This parameter represents the total path length that the object has covered. It should be specified in a consistent unit of measurement, such as meters, kilometers, or miles. It is crucial that the units of distance are compatible with the units of time to ensure that the resultant speed is accurately computed.\n\n- **Time (TimeTaken):** This parameter denotes the duration over which the object has been in motion. It is vital to express this in a consistent time unit, like seconds, minutes, or hours. The chosen unit must correspond with the distance unit to maintain a coherent speed unit, such as meters per second or kilometers per hour.\n\n### Functionality:\n\nThe function works by executing the speed formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{DistanceTravelled}}{\\text{TimeTaken}} \\]\n\nThe resulting speed will be in units of distance per time, given that both input parameters are in matching units. For example, if the distance is measured in kilometers and the time in hours, the speed will be calculated in kilometers per hour.\n\n### Edge Cases and Considerations:\n\n- **Zero or Negative Time:** It is important to handle cases where the time taken is zero or negative, as this would lead to division by zero or an illogical result. The function should ideally return an error or handle such inputs gracefully.\n\n- **Zero or Negative Distance:** If the distance traveled is zero, the function should correctly return a speed of zero, as no movement implies no speed. Negative distances may not be physically meaningful and should be addressed according to the specific context of usage.\n\n- **Unit Consistency:** It is crucial that the input units are consistent and appropriate for the", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"distance": {"type": "integer", "description": "The distance the object travelled in meters."}, "time": {"type": "integer", "description": "The time it took for the object to travel in seconds."}, "to_unit": {"type": "string", "description": "The unit in which the speed should be calculated, default is m/s."}}, "required": ["distance", "time"]}}, {"name": "calculate_speed2", "description": "Calculate the speed of an object based on the distance travelled and the time taken.Alright, so you want to figure out how fast something is moving?

This methodology combines multiple decision trees to form a robust model that improves accuracy and reduces the risk of overfitting compared to a single decision tree. \n\n### Functionality\n- **Data Input**: The function requires a dataset as input, typically structured in a tabular form where each row represents an individual data instance and each column corresponds to a feature or attribute. The dataset should include both the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target) that the model aims to predict.\n  \n- **Model Training**: Once the data is provided, the function will initiate the process of training the Random Forest model. This involves generating multiple decision trees, each trained on a random subset of the data. The randomness in feature selection and data sampling ensures that the ensemble of trees captures various patterns within the data.\n\n- **Hyperparameters**: During the training phase, various hyperparameters can be set to tune the model's performance. These can include the number of trees in the forest, the maximum depth of each tree, the minimum number of samples required to split a node, and others. Appropriate selection of these hyperparameters is crucial for optimizing the model's predictive power.\n\n- **Output**: After the training process is complete, the function outputs a trained Random Forest model. This model can be used for making predictions on new data, where it aggregates the predictions from all individual trees to provide a final output, typically employing majority voting for classification tasks or averaging for regression tasks.\n\n### Edge Cases\n- The function assumes that the input data is clean and preprocessed, with no missing values or categorical features that haven't been encoded. If the dataset contains such issues, it may lead to errors or suboptimal performance.\n- The function's performance may vary based on the size and quality of the dataset.

Allows for the bulk recording of query classifications in one function call.This function is designed to efficiently record classifications for a series of queries by utilizing the intent names supplied as keyword arguments. It is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple query intents need to be processed and stored simultaneously. The primary purpose of the function is to streamline the process of assigning classifications to queries, thereby saving time and reducing the potential for errors that might occur if each query were handled individually.\n\nBy passing intent names as keyword arguments, the function enables a more organized and readable way to map each query to its corresponding intent classification. This method not only allows for a clear association between queries and their intents but also provides an easy-to-update mechanism if changes are required in the future. Bulk recording through this function call eliminates the need for repetitive single query classification, leading to improved performance and efficiency in handling large datasets.\n\nFor example, if you have a series of user queries each associated with a different intent such as \"purchase,\" \"support,\" and \"feedback,\" you can call this function with keyword arguments like `purchase='query1'`, `support='query2'`, and `feedback='query3'`. This way, each query is classified according to its intent in a single, cohesive action. The function handles the underlying logic to appropriately associate and store each query with the specified intent name, ensuring that the data is accurately recorded.\n\nThis approach also provides clarity in the function call, as each keyword argument clearly indicates the intent associated with its respective query. This clarity is beneficial during debugging or review, as the intent classification of each query is explicitly stated, reducing ambiguity and potential mismatches. Additionally, the bulk processing capability makes this function an ideal choice for applications that require high-throughput classification tasks.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["acc_routing_start", "atm_finder_start", "faq_link_accounts_start", "get_balance_start", "get_transactions_start", "outofscope"], "properties": {"acc_routing_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries requesting the bank routing numbers or account numbers."}, "atm_finder_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for locations of ATMs, specified in the format of 'City, State (abbr)', such as 'Berkeley, CA' or 'New York, NY'."}, "faq_link_accounts_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to linking accounts within the bank's system."}, "get_balance_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for account balances, available funds, or other financial balances."}, "get_transactions_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to viewing transactions, deposits, purchases, and transaction details."}, "outofscope": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries that do not classify to any other available intents."}}}}, {"name": "record2", "description": "Records classifications for a series of queries based on the intent names provided as keyword arguments.

These parameters are fundamental in determining the value of a residential property as they provide essential insights into its size, utility, and potentially its age or historical significance.\n\n### Parameters:\n1. **Area**: This parameter represents the total livable space within the house, typically measured in square feet or square meters. It is a critical factor in real estate valuation as larger homes generally command higher prices. The area should be a positive numerical value, and functions typically assume an accurate measurement devoid of external spaces such as gardens or driveways unless specified otherwise.\n\n2. **Number of Rooms**: This denotes the total count of discrete rooms within the house, including bedrooms, bathrooms, and living areas. More rooms often indicate greater functionality and appeal to potential buyers, thereby influencing the house's market value. The input for this parameter should be a positive integer reflecting the physical structure of the property.\n\n3. **Year of Construction**: This parameter refers to the year when the house was built, providing insight into its age. Older construction may suggest historic value or potential need for renovations, whereas newer builds may imply modern design and lower maintenance costs. The input for this parameter should be a four-digit year, reflecting the actual completion year of the building.\n\n### Functionality:\nThe function uses these three parameters to estimate the market value of a house. It may employ statistical models, regression analysis, or machine learning techniques to evaluate the impact of each parameter on the overall price. The result is a predicted house price that can be used for various purposes, including setting a listing price or assessing investment opportunities.\n\n### Usage Example:\nTo use the function, a user would input the specific details for a property they wish to evaluate:\n\n```python\npredicted_price = predict_house_price(area=2000, number_of_rooms", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"area": {"type": "integer", "description": "Area of the house in square feet."}, "rooms": {"type": "integer", "description": "Number of rooms in the house."}, "year": {"type": "integer", "description": "Year when the house was constructed."}, "location": {"type": "string", "description": "The location or city of the house."}}, "required": ["area", "rooms", "year", "location"]}}, {"name": "predict_house_price2", "description": "Predict house price based on area, number of rooms and year of construction.This function helps you figure out what a house might cost by looking at its size, how many rooms it has, and when it was built.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"area": {"type": "integer", "description": "Area of the house in square feet."}, "rooms": {"type": "integer", "description": "Number of rooms in the house."}, "year": {"type": "integer", "description": "Year when the house was constructed."}, "location": {"type": "string", "description": "The location or city of the house."}}, "required": ["area", "rooms", "year", "location"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"predict_house_price1": {"area": 2500, "rooms": 5, "year": 1990}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"predict_house_price1": {"area": 2500, "rooms": 5, "year": 1990}}], "possible_answer": [{"predict_house_price1": {"area": [2500], "rooms": [5], "year": [1990], "location": ["San Francisco", "SF"]}}, {"predict_house_price2": {"area": [2500], "rooms": [5], "year": [1990], "location": ["San Francisco", "SF"]}}, {"predict_house_price3": {"area": [2500], "rooms": [5], "year": [1990], "location": ["San Francisco", "SF"]}}]}

This is achieved by taking two primary inputs: the total dividend payout and the number of outstanding shares. The total dividend payout refers to the sum of money a company decides to distribute to its shareholders as dividends over a specified period, typically a quarter. The outstanding shares are the total number of shares that are currently held by all shareholders, including institutional investors and company insiders, but excluding shares repurchased by the company.\n\nTo compute the quarterly dividend per share, the function divides the total dividend payout by the number of outstanding shares. This division results in the amount of dividend each share is entitled to receive for the quarter. It is an important calculation often used by investors to assess the attractiveness of a company's stock in terms of income generation.\n\nHere is a brief explanation of how the function works and some considerations to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Parameters:**\n   - **Total Dividend Payout (Numerical):** The total sum allocated by the company for distribution among shareholders as dividends for the quarter.\n   - **Outstanding Shares (Numerical):** The number of shares currently held by shareholders, which represents the denominator in the calculation.\n\n2. **Return Value:**\n   - The function returns the calculated quarterly dividend per share, which is a numerical value representing the dividend amount attributable to each share for the given quarter.\n\n3. **Usage Example:**\n   Suppose a company declares a total dividend payout of $1,000,000, and it has 500,000 outstanding shares. The function would compute the quarterly dividend per share as $1,000,000 divided by 500,000, resulting in a dividend of $2 per share.\n\n4. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If the number of outstanding shares is zero, an error or exception should be handled since division by zero is undefined. It is crucial to validate input to ensure accuracy and prevent runtime errors.\n   - The function assumes that both input parameters are", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"total_payout": {"type": "integer", "description": "The total amount of dividends paid out in USD"}, "outstanding_shares": {"type": "integer", "description": "Total number of outstanding shares"}}, "required": ["total_payout", "outstanding_shares"], "optional": []}}, {"name": "finance.calculate_quarterly_dividend_per_share2", "description": "Calculate quarterly dividend per share for a company given total dividend payout and outstanding sharesThis function helps you figure out how much dividend each share gets every quarter.

This function plays a crucial role for investors seeking to forecast their potential earnings from a mutual fund over a specific time frame.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n1. **Yearly Yield**: This parameter represents the annual percentage increase in the value of the mutual fund. It is typically expressed as a decimal fraction (e.g., a 5% yield would be expressed as 0.05). The yearly yield is a critical factor as it determines how much the investment is expected to grow each year.\n\n2. **Investment Amount**: This is the initial amount of money invested in the mutual fund. The investment amount is the principal sum on which the returns are calculated. A higher initial investment generally results in higher total returns, assuming the yield remains constant.\n\n3. **Time Period**: This parameter specifies the duration for which the investment will be held, typically measured in years. The time period is fundamental in compounding calculations, as it determines how many times the yield is applied to the investment.\n\n**Functionality and Edge Cases:**\n\nThe function calculates the estimated return by applying the compound interest formula, which considers the effect of the yearly yield over the specified time period. It assumes that the yield is compounded annually, and the returns are reinvested at the same rate. \n\nIn scenarios where the time period is zero, the function should return the initial investment amount, as no time has passed for the yield to be applied.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.This function is designed to execute commands at the system level on Windows operating systems by utilizing the `os.system()` function provided by Python's standard library. The `os.system()` function serves as an interface to the underlying operating system, allowing for the execution of commands as if they were entered directly into the command prompt or terminal on a Windows machine.\n\nThis function is versatile in that it can handle not only single, standalone commands but also multiple commands that are linked together using the '&&' operator. This operator allows for the execution of a sequence of commands, where each subsequent command is executed only if the preceding command completes successfully without any errors. This chaining mechanism makes it possible to perform a series of operations in a single call to the function, which can be particularly useful for scripting and automation tasks on Windows platforms.\n\nFor example, if you want to execute a command that first navigates to a specific directory and then lists the contents of that directory, you can chain these commands together like so: `cd C:\\example\\directory && dir`. This will first change the current working directory to the specified path and then execute the `dir` command to list the files and directories within that path, provided the directory change is successful.\n\nIt is important to note that the `os.system()` function will return the exit status of the command executed, which can be used to determine whether the command was successful (typically returning zero) or if an error occurred (returning a non-zero value). Additionally, while using `os.system()`, the system shell is invoked, which means command execution can be susceptible to shell injection if inputs are not properly sanitized.\n\nKeep in mind the following when using this function:\n- It is specifically intended for use on Windows operating systems.\n- The function can execute multiple commands chained with '&&', ensuring subsequent commands are dependent on the success of prior ones.\n- The output of the executed commands is typically directed to the standard output and standard error streams of the shell, rather than being captured", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'The function is designed explicitly for use on Windows operating systems and serves the purpose of executing system-level commands by utilizing the `os.system()` method. This method is part of the Python `os` module and is used to run shell commands directly from a Python script. The function is capable of executing both individual commands and a sequence of multiple commands that are connected with the '&&' operator. \n\nThe '&&' operator allows for the chaining of commands, meaning that each command will only execute if the preceding command completes successfully. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the execution of subsequent commands is contingent upon the successful execution of prior commands. For instance, if you need to compile a program and then run it, you can chain these commands with '&&' to ensure the program only runs if the compilation succeeds.\n\nWhen using this function, it's important to be aware of the context in which the commands are executed. The `os.system()` function initiates a subshell, and the commands are executed in this subshell. The function returns an exit status code indicating the success or failure of the command execution, where a return value of zero typically signifies successful execution and any non-zero value indicates an error.\n\nHere is an example of how you might use the function: if you want to create a directory and then navigate into it, you could pass the command string `\"mkdir new_folder && cd new_folder\"` to this function. This would first attempt to create a directory named \"new_folder\" and, upon successful creation, change the current directory to \"new_folder\".\n\nIt's essential to consider the security implications of executing system commands, as improper handling of input can lead to vulnerabilities such as code injection attacks.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.This function is designed to execute a system-level command using the `os.system()` method specifically on Windows operating systems. The `os.system()` function is part of Python's `os` module, which provides a way to interface with the underlying operating system. When called, this function allows for the execution of a command as if it were entered directly at the Windows command prompt.\n\nA key feature of this function is its ability to execute not only single commands but also multiple commands that are chained together using the `&&` operator. The `&&` operator in command-line operations is used to execute multiple commands in sequence, ensuring that each command runs only if the preceding command was successful. This means that if one of the commands in the chain fails, any subsequent commands will not be executed.\n\nFor example, using this function, a user can execute a command such as `echo Hello && echo World`, which first prints `Hello` and then, only if successful, prints `World` to the terminal.\n\nWhen utilizing this function, it is important to ensure that the commands being executed are compatible with the Windows command prompt environment, as the `os.system()` function is simply passing these commands directly to the operating system's shell for execution. This function can be particularly useful for automating complex tasks that require multiple command executions in a sequence, provided that the commands are correctly formatted for the Windows OS command line.\n\nGiven the nature of `os.system()`, it is also important to consider security implications, especially if the commands are constructed from user input, as this could introduce the risk of command injection.

This operator ensures that each command is executed sequentially, and the subsequent command will only run if the preceding command is successful. \n\nIn scenarios where the tasks you wish to perform are complex or involve a series of multiple commands that require more sophisticated scripting than simple sequential execution, it is recommended to create a batch file (with a .bat extension). A batch file allows for more advanced scripting capabilities, including handling conditional executions, loops, and other control structures which aren't easily managed with simple command chaining. Once the batch file has been created and configured as needed, you can then execute it using the `os.system()` function, thereby leveraging the capabilities of batch scripting within the Windows environment.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use this function:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# A single command example\nos.system('echo Hello, World')\n\n# Multiple commands example\nos.system('echo First Command && echo Second Command')\n\n# For complex scripts, write commands to a .bat file and execute\n# Example of writing to a .bat file\nwith open('example.bat', 'w') as file:\n    file.write('echo This is a complex task\\n')\n    file.write('echo Another line in the batch file\\n')\n\n# Execute the .bat file\nos.system('example.bat')\n```\n\nIn this usage context, ensure that the commands and file paths you provide are correctly formatted for the Windows command line to avoid execution errors. Always test commands individually to confirm they execute as expected before incorporating them into a batch file for more complex operations.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The Windows command line instruction(s) to be executed.

It utilizes advanced algorithms to determine the most efficient route based on the input locations, which are typically entered as geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) or physical addresses. The function considers various factors such as road types, speed limits, and real-time traffic updates to ensure the accuracy of the distance calculation.\n\nThis calculation process starts by identifying the starting and ending points within a digital map service, which provides a detailed view of the road infrastructure. It then analyzes potential routes using a combination of shortest path algorithms, such as Dijkstra\u2019s or A* algorithm, to find the optimal route. The function also takes into account any road closures or detours that may impact the directness of the journey.\n\nAn important edge case to note is when the two locations are the same; in such scenarios, the function will return a distance of zero, as no travel is required. Additionally, if one or both locations are not connected by any road network, the function may return an error or a null value, indicating that the calculation could not be completed.\n\nUsage Example:\nTo use this function, the user needs to input two valid locations. For example, if a user wants to compute the shortest driving distance between Times Square in New York City and the White House in Washington, D.C., they would input the respective addresses or coordinates for these landmarks.

The departure location specifies the airport or city from which the traveler wishes to start their trip, while the departure time indicates when they intend to leave.\n\nIn addition to these mandatory parameters, the function offers the flexibility to accommodate round-trip bookings. This is achieved through an optional parameter that allows users to specify a return time. If the return time is provided, the function will proceed to book both the outbound and the return flights, ensuring a complete round-trip itinerary. On the other hand, if the return time is omitted, the function will only process the booking for a one-way trip, solely based on the departure location and time.\n\nAn example usage scenario could be a user who wants to book a flight from New York City to Los Angeles, departing on the 15th of June at 10:00 AM. If they also wish to return to New York City on the 20th of June at 4:00 PM, they would specify this return time to complete their round-trip booking.\n\nIn summary, this function is versatile, catering to both one-way and round-trip flight bookings by utilizing mandatory parameters such as departure location and time, while optionally incorporating a return time for users who plan to return to their original departure point.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["departure_location", "departure_time"], "properties": {"departure_location": {"type": "string", "description": "The departure location in the format of 'City (abbr), State', such as 'Los Angeles, CA' or 'New York, NY'."}, "departure_time": {"type": "string", "description": "The departure time in the format of 'dd/mm/yyyy HH:MM', representing the local time of the departure location."}, "return_time": {"type": "string", "description": "The return time in the format of 'dd/mm/yyyy HH:MM', representing the local time of the departure location.

This function offers the ability to produce a sequence of notes that can form a cohesive and harmonious tune. It achieves this by considering several key musical elements that influence the overall sound and structure of the melody.\n\nParameters that typically influence the melody generation might include:\n\n1. **Key Signature**: Determines the scale in which the melody will be composed. For example, a melody in C Major will sound different from one in A Minor due to the different set of notes emphasized in each scale.\n   \n2. **Tempo**: This refers to the speed or pace of the melody, usually measured in beats per minute (BPM). A higher tempo results in a faster piece of music, while a lower tempo creates a slower melody.\n\n3. **Rhythm**: Defines the pattern of beats in the melody, including note durations and the timing between notes. This can range from simple, repetitive patterns to complex and varied rhythms.\n\n4. **Melodic Range**: Sets the highest and lowest pitches that the melody can reach. This can influence the emotional impact of the melody, with wider ranges often being more dramatic.\n\n5. **Note Density**: Controls how many notes appear within a given segment of the melody. A higher density can create a more intricate and busy sound, while a lower density can make the melody feel more relaxed and spacious.\n\nBy adjusting these parameters, the `generateMelody` function can produce a wide variety of musical lines that can serve different purposes, from part of a larger composition to a standalone musical piece. This function is particularly useful for composers and musicians who need to quickly generate musical ideas or for applications that require dynamic music creation, such as video games or interactive media.\n\nFor example, calling `generateMelody(key='C Major', tempo=120, rhythm='4/4', range=(C4, C6), density=5)` might produce a", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"key": {"type": "string", "description": "The key of the melody.

In the classic game of blackjack, the goal is for players to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. The function operates by comparing the total value of each player's hand, including the dealer's, according to the rules of blackjack.\n\nThe function first assesses whether any player has a hand total of exactly 21, known as a \"blackjack,\" which is the optimal hand. If a player achieves this with their initial hand of two cards, they are declared the winner unless the dealer also has a blackjack, which would result in a tie, known as a \"push.\"\n\nIf no player has a blackjack, the function then checks for any hands that exceed 21, which is called a \"bust.\" Any player or the dealer with a hand total over 21 automatically loses, regardless of other hands.\n\nNext, the function compares the remaining valid hands (those 21 or under) to determine the highest value. The player with the highest valid hand total, closer to 21 than any other, is declared the winner, as long as their hand is higher than the dealer's. If the dealer's hand is higher, the dealer wins. If there is a tie between the player and the dealer's hands, the outcome is a push.\n\nThe function should account for multiple players, checking each player's hand against the dealer's in sequence, and declare winners accordingly. It assumes all hands are valid and properly formatted according to the rules of blackjack, and it should handle ties and busts appropriately to ensure accurate results.\n\nUsage Example:\nAssume the function is called `determineBlackjackWinner`, and it takes an array of player hands and a dealer hand as inputs.

Unlike a straightforward linear distance calculation, this function takes into account various terrain factors that may affect the actual travel distance. \n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **location1**: This parameter represents the starting point of the distance calculation. It typically includes geographical coordinates such as latitude and longitude.\n  \n- **location2**: This is the endpoint of the distance calculation. It is also represented by geographical coordinates, including latitude and longitude.\n\n- **terrainData** (optional): This parameter may include additional information about the terrain between the two locations. Terrain data could encompass aspects like elevation changes, type of terrain (e.g., mountains, plains, water bodies), and any natural or man-made obstacles that might influence the route.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\nThe function calculates the distance by taking into account not only the straight-line geographical distance but also the terrain features that may cause deviations or fluctuations in the actual travel path. It might use algorithms that factor in topographical maps or digital elevation models to provide a more accurate reflection of the distance involved in traversing the given terrain.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Flat Terrain**: In scenarios where the terrain is fairly uniform, such as open plains or flatlands, the distance calculated may closely resemble the straight-line distance.\n  \n- **Mountainous or Rugged Terrain**: In cases where the terrain is mountainous or contains significant obstacles, the function will return a longer distance to reflect the increased travel effort required.\n\n- **Water Bodies**: If the terrain includes large bodies of water, the function might incorporate known routes like bridges or ferries to calculate the effective distance.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nTo use this function, you might have an input similar to the following:\n\n```python\ndistance = calculateDistance(location1=(34.0522, -118.2437), location2=(36.1699, -115.1398), terrainData=terrain", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"origin": {"type": "string", "description": "Starting location of the distance measurement."}, "destination": {"type": "string", "description": "Destination location of the distance measurement."}, "consider_terrain": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether to account for terrain in distance calculation, defaults to false."}}, "required": ["origin", "destination"]}}, {"name": "distance_calculator.calculate2", "description": "Calculate the distance between two locations, considering terrain.This function helps you figure out how far apart two spots are, taking into account the terrain between them.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"origin": {"type": "string", "description": "Starting location of the distance measurement."}, "destination": {"type": "string", "description": "Destination location of the distance measurement."}, "consider_terrain": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether to account for terrain in distance calculation, defaults to false."}}, "required": ["origin", "destination"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"distance_calculator.calculate2": {"origin": "New York", "destination": "Boston"}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"distance_calculator.calculate2": {"origin": "New York", "destination": "Boston"}}], "possible_answer": [{"distance_calculator.calculate1": {"origin": ["New York", "New York City", "New York City, NY", "New York, NY", "NYC"], "destination": ["Boston"], "consider_terrain": [true]}}, {"distance_calculator.calculate2": {"origin": ["New York", "New York City", "New York City, NY", "New York, NY", "NYC"], "destination": ["Boston"], "consider_terrain": [true]}}, {"distance_calculator.calculate3": {"origin": ["New York", "New York City", "New York City, NY", "New York, NY", "NYC"], "destination": ["Boston"], "consider_terrain": [true]}}]}
