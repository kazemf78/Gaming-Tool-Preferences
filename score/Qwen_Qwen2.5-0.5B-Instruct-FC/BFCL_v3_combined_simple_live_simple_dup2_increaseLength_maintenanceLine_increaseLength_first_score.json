Prime factorization involves expressing the integer as a product of prime numbers, which are numbers that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The function takes a single integer input, which must be a positive integer greater than 1, as prime factorization is not defined for numbers less than 2.\n\nWhen the function is called with an appropriate integer input, it determines the smallest prime number that divides the integer without leaving a remainder. It records this prime number as a factor and divides the input integer by this prime. This process is repeated on the quotient obtained, continuously dividing by the smallest possible prime factor until the quotient itself becomes a prime number. At this point, the list of prime factors collected provides the complete prime factorization of the original integer.\n\nIt is important to note that the function should be able to handle a variety of edge cases, such as very large integers, ensuring that it accurately provides a prime factorization regardless of the size of the input. Additionally, the function should efficiently manage scenarios where the input is a prime number, swiftly identifying that the number is its own prime factorization.\n\nFor example, if the function is called with the integer 28, the output would be the list [2, 2, 7], representing that 28 is equal to 2 multiplied by 2 and multiplied by 7. Similarly, calling the function with the integer 13, which is a prime number, would return [13], indicating that it cannot be factored further into other prime numbers.\n\nThe function is expected to output the prime factors in ascending order, and for each prime factor, it should appear as many times as its power in the prime factorization of the integer.

Under such circumstances, where the LLM's output lacks a definitive answer, the function is programmed to return an empty string as a means of indicating the absence of a valid response. This feature is crucial for handling edge cases where the LLM's response might be ambiguous, null, or irrelevant, thus allowing the calling process to discern between a valid response and a lack of information. \n\nFor example, if the input to the LLM is a question and the LLM responds with a clear answer, this function will strip away any extraneous data and deliver the answer directly. Conversely, if the LLM's output is unclear or non-responsive, such as when it returns an error message or irrelevant data, the function will detect this scenario and yield an empty string instead. This ensures robustness in applications relying on LLM outputs, as it provides a consistent method of determining whether a valid answer has been obtained or if further action is needed to solicit a clearer response.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["answer"], "properties": {"answer": {"type": "string", "description": "The answer generated by the Large Language Model in plain text.

The purpose of this function is to facilitate tracking and further processing of tasks or activities that need to be completed. This is particularly useful in project management, personal task tracking, or any scenario where organizing tasks into a list is beneficial.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **item**: The item to be added to the to-do list. This could be a string representing a task description, such as \"Buy groceries\" or \"Finish project report.\" The item should clearly and concisely describe the task so that it can be easily understood and acted upon later.\n\n- **toDoList**: The list to which the new item will be added. This must be a mutable data structure, typically an array or list, depending on the programming language being used. The list is expected to maintain its order, with the new item typically added to the end to reflect the sequence in which tasks are added or discovered.\n\n#### Function Behavior:\n- **Adding the Item**: When an item is added to the to-do list, it becomes part of the list's collection of items. This enables users to view all tasks needing attention, facilitating effective task management.\n\n- **Tracking and Processing**: Once the item is part of the to-do list, it can be tracked over time. Tracking involves periodically checking the list to ensure tasks are not forgotten. Further processing could involve marking the item as complete, prioritizing it amongst other tasks, or removing it from the list once it's no longer relevant.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- **Duplicate Items**: The function does not inherently prevent duplicate entries. If the same item is added more than once, it will appear multiple times in the list unless additional logic is implemented to check for and handle duplicates.\n\n- **Empty Strings or Null Values**: Adding an item with an empty string or a null value may not be meaningful.

It prepares data for machine learning models, ensuring numerical values are scaled properly and categorical variables are appropriately transformed.This function serves as a crucial preprocessing step in the pipeline of preparing data for machine learning models. The primary objective of this function is to transform raw input data into a format that can be effectively used by various machine learning algorithms. It achieves this by performing two key operations: normalization of numerical values and encoding of categorical variables.\n\nThe normalization process involves adjusting the scale of numerical features to ensure that they contribute equally to the model's performance. This is particularly important in cases where the numerical features have varying units or magnitudes. By bringing all numerical values to a consistent scale, often within a range such as [0, 1] or having a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, the function helps prevent any single feature from disproportionately influencing the model due to its scale.\n\nIn addition to normalization, this function also addresses categorical variables, which are non-numeric data types that represent categories or labels. Such variables need to be converted into a numerical form before being fed into machine learning models, as these models typically require numerical input. The function accomplishes this transformation through encoding techniques, such as one-hot encoding or label encoding. One-hot encoding transforms each categorical variable into a binary vector, ensuring that the model can understand and process these variables without assuming any inherent order or relationship. Label encoding assigns a unique integer to each category, which can be useful for certain algorithms that can handle ordinal relationships.\n\nBy performing normalization and encoding, the function ensures that the input data is in an optimal condition for training machine learning models, facilitating better performance and accuracy. This preprocessing step is essential for any data pipeline aiming to extract meaningful insights and predictions from data with diverse characteristics.\n\nExample usage:\nSuppose you have a dataset containing both numerical features, such as age and salary, and categorical features, like country or department. This function will normalize the age and salary to a common scale, and encode the country and department into numerical representations, thus making the dataset ready for model consumption.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["data", "normalize", "categories"], "properties": {"data": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "float"}, "description": "A list of numerical values representing the data to be processed.

It requires two main inputs: a frequency and a range. The frequency determines the number of cycles the sine wave completes in one unit of time, measured in Hertz (Hz). A higher frequency results in more oscillations over the same period, while a lower frequency yields fewer oscillations. \n\nThe range specifies the interval over which the sine wave is plotted, typically in terms of time or angular measure, such as radians or degrees. This range is crucial for defining the x-axis of the plot, which might represent time or an angular domain. By specifying this range, users can control the portion of the sine wave they wish to analyze or display. \n\nThe function calculates the sine values for points throughout the defined range at the given frequency, and then it plots these values on a graph. The y-axis of the plot represents the amplitude of the sine wave, which oscillates between -1 and 1 for a standard sine function. This visualization helps to understand the wave's characteristics, such as its amplitude, period, and phase, when combined with other parameters like phase shift or vertical displacement, which are not part of this basic function but could be added in more complex implementations. \n\nAn example of how this function might be used is as follows: If a user wishes to plot a sine wave with a frequency of 5 Hz over a time range from 0 to 2 seconds, the function would generate points that represent the sine wave's amplitude at various time intervals within this range. The resulting plot would visually display five complete cycles of the sine wave within the specified time frame, providing a clear depiction of its oscillatory behavior. \n\nIt is important to note that if the specified range is too small or not appropriately aligned with the frequency, the resulting plot might not effectively visualize the wave's characteristics or might not depict a", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"start_range": {"type": "float", "description": "Start of the range in radians.

Each query is evaluated against established criteria and classification rules to determine its category, ensuring that the logging is both accurate and consistent. This function plays a critical role in understanding user behavior by providing insights into the frequency and nature of different types of queries. Additionally, the classification into predefined categories allows for easier aggregation and reporting of data. \n\nAn example use case could involve a search feature on a website, where the function logs queries such as \"product search,\" \"customer support,\" or \"account information,\" based on the content and intent of the user's input. Parameters typically include the query text itself and possibly meta-information such as timestamp or user ID for context. Edge cases to consider might include ambiguous queries that could fit multiple categories or completely novel queries that do not clearly match any existing category.

It is essential for organizations that handle a high volume of customer interactions, as it enables them to organize, analyze, and manage these queries effectively. \n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- **Query ID:** A unique identifier for each customer service query that needs to be classified. This ensures that each entry in the system can be uniquely tracked and referenced.\n\n- **Classification Type:** A predefined category or label assigned to the customer service query. This classification helps in sorting the queries into different types for easier management and analysis.

This is crucial for maintaining an accurate timeline of when queries are processed and addressed.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n- If a query does not match any existing classification type, there should be a default classification to ensure no queries remain unclassified, or the system should prompt for the creation of a new classification category.\n\n- In cases where a query is reclassified, the system should update the classification record accordingly to reflect the most current category, potentially retaining the history of changes for auditing purposes.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\nImagine a scenario where a customer calls with a complaint about a delayed shipment. The customer service representative would use this function to assign the query a unique ID, classify it under the 'Shipping Issue' category, and record the exact time at which the classification was made.

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method for classification, regression, and other tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time. The core principle of Random Forest is to leverage the wisdom of the crowd by combining the predictions of several decision trees to improve the overall model accuracy and control over-fitting.\n\n### Function Parameters:\n\n- **data**: This parameter represents the dataset on which the Random Forest Model will be trained. It should be a structured dataset, typically in the form of a DataFrame, where rows correspond to data points and columns correspond to features. The data should also include a target variable, which is the variable the model aims to predict.\n\n### Functionality:\n\nUpon invocation, the function will initialize a Random Forest Model with default or pre-specified hyperparameters such as the number of trees in the forest, the maximum depth of the trees, and the number of features to consider when looking for the best split. The function will then proceed to fit the model to the training data, utilizing a specified target variable from the dataset.\n\n### Edge Cases and Considerations:\n\n- The dataset provided must not contain any missing values in the features or the target variable as this could lead to errors during model training.\n- Categorical features, if any, should be appropriately encoded to numerical values before training the model.\n- The function's performance and accuracy can be significantly influenced by the choice of hyperparameters and the quality of the input data.\n\n### Usage Example:\n\n```python\n# Assuming `train_data` is a DataFrame with features and a target column named 'target'\nmodel = train_random_forest(data=train_data)\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how to call the function with a prepared dataset ready for training.

Specifically, it takes into account the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, and the total area of the house, typically measured in square feet or square meters. \n\nWhen using this function, users must provide three critical input parameters: \n\n1. **Number of Bedrooms**: This parameter indicates how many bedrooms the house contains. It is an integer value that can affect the house's overall appeal and market value, as more bedrooms generally increase a home\u2019s utility and desirability, especially for larger families.\n\n2. **Number of Bathrooms**: This parameter signifies the total count of bathrooms in the house. Similar to bedrooms, bathrooms are a crucial aspect of a home\u2019s functionality and comfort. This integer value can influence the price significantly, as more bathrooms can imply greater convenience for occupants.\n\n3. **Area**: This parameter represents the total living space of the house. It is a numeric value and is typically provided in square feet or square meters. The area is one of the primary factors in determining a home's price, as larger homes typically command higher prices due to the increased space they offer.\n\nBy processing these inputs, the function estimates the price of the house. The model behind this function likely uses historical data from the real estate market, possibly employing statistical techniques or machine learning models to draw inferences and provide an accurate price prediction. Users should ensure the inputs are realistic and accurate to get the most reliable prediction.\n\nThis function is ideal for prospective home buyers, real estate agents, and property investors seeking data-driven insights into the potential market price of houses based on specific criteria.

This means that it takes multiple query strings and categorizes each based on the intent it matches. The function requires parameters where each parameter corresponds to a distinct intent. These parameters are intended to be lists, and each list contains query strings that are to be classified under the respective intent that the parameter represents. By utilizing this function, users can efficiently organize and manage queries by grouping them according to the predefined intents, ensuring they are categorized correctly. This is particularly useful in applications involving natural language processing or automated customer service systems, where understanding the intent behind a query is crucial for providing accurate responses or performing specific actions.

By allowing keyword arguments, users have the flexibility to specify intent names that accurately describe the purpose or category of each query. This feature enables precise classification and organization of data, which is particularly useful in applications such as natural language processing, user interaction analysis, and automated response systems.\n\nIn practical usage, the function accepts several keyword arguments where each key corresponds to a query, and its value represents the intent name. For example, if you have a series of queries related to customer support interactions, you might use the function to assign intents like \"billing_inquiry\", \"technical_support\", or \"general_feedback\" to each query, thereby tagging them for further processing or analysis.\n\nAn edge case to consider when using this function is ensuring that the intent names provided in the keyword arguments are valid and recognized by the system. Invalid or misspelled intent names may result in misclassification or errors. Additionally, the user should handle scenarios where no intent is provided for a query, as this might require default handling or error reporting within the function.\n\nOverall, this function is a powerful tool for users who need to efficiently manage and record classifications across a wide range of queries. By allowing for bulk operations, it reduces the overhead and potential for error compared to recording each classification individually. It is important for users to familiarize themselves with the expected format and constraints of the keyword arguments to make the most of this function's capabilities.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["acc_routing_start", "atm_finder_start", "faq_link_accounts_start", "get_balance_start", "get_transactions_start", "outofscope"], "properties": {"acc_routing_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries requesting the bank routing numbers or account numbers."}, "atm_finder_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for locations of ATMs, specified in the format of 'City, State (abbr)', such as 'Berkeley, CA' or 'New York, NY'."}, "faq_link_accounts_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to linking accounts within the bank's system."}, "get_balance_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for account balances, available funds, or other financial balances."}, "get_transactions_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to viewing transactions, deposits, purchases, and transaction details."}, "outofscope": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries that do not classify to any other available intents."}}}}, {"name": "record2", "description": "Records classifications for a series of queries based on the intent names provided as keyword arguments.

It is expressed as a value between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates that the event cannot occur under any circumstances, and 1 indicates that the event is certain to occur.\n\nIn the context of this function, the probability is typically calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. For example, if you're rolling a fair six-sided die and want to calculate the probability of rolling a four, there is one favorable outcome (rolling a four) and six possible outcomes (one for each side of the die), so the probability would be 1/6.\n\nTo utilize this function, you would generally provide two parameters: the number of favorable outcomes and the total number of possible outcomes, both of which should be non-negative integers. The function then returns a floating-point number representing the probability, ensuring that the division is handled appropriately to maintain precision.\n\nThis function is particularly useful in a wide range of applications, from simple games of chance to complex statistical models. Users should be cautious when defining the inputs to ensure that the total number of possible outcomes is not zero, as this would result in a division by zero error, which is undefined in mathematics and would lead to a runtime error in most programming environments.\n\nHere's an example of how the function might be used:\n\n```python\n# Example usage:\nnumber_of_favorable_outcomes = 1\ntotal_number_of_possible_outcomes = 6\nprobability = calculate_probability(number_of_favorable_outcomes, total_number_of_possible_outcomes)\nprint(\"The probability of the event is:\", probability)\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `calculate_probability` is called with the parameters for a single favorable outcome and a total of six possible outcomes, which outputs the probability of approximately 0", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"success_outcomes": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of successful outcomes."}, "total_outcomes": {"type": "integer", "description": "The total number of possible outcomes."}, "format_as_ratio": {"type": "boolean", "description": "When true, formats the output as a ratio instead of a decimal.

The NPV is a crucial financial metric used to evaluate the profitability of an investment by determining the present value of expected future cash flows and comparing it to the initial investment.\n\nTo compute the NPV, the function considers the series of future cash flows expected from the investment, which are the amounts of money that are projected to be received or paid at various time intervals. Each cash flow is discounted back to its present value using the given discount rate, which reflects the time value of money and the risk associated with the investment. The discount rate is typically expressed as a percentage and represents the required rate of return that the investor expects to earn.\n\nThe initial investment is the amount of capital that is required at the start of the investment process. This initial outlay is subtracted from the sum of the present values of the future cash flows to compute the NPV. A positive NPV indicates that the projected earnings, in present value terms, exceed the initial investment, suggesting a potentially profitable investment. Conversely, a negative NPV suggests that the investment may not achieve the desired rate of return.\n\nFor example, if an investor expects to receive cash flows of $1000, $1200, and $1500 over the next three years, with an initial investment of $3000 and a discount rate of 10%, the function will discount each of the future cash flows to their present value and subtract the initial investment from the total present value of these cash flows to determine the NPV.

Compound interest is a method of calculating interest where the interest earned over time is added to the principal, and from that point forward, interest is calculated on this new principal amount. This function takes into account several key parameters: the initial principal amount, the annual interest rate, the number of times interest is compounded per year, and the total number of years the money is invested or borrowed for.\n\nTo use this function effectively, the user must provide:\n\n1. **Principal Amount**: This is the initial sum of money that is invested or borrowed. It is crucial as it forms the base on which interest will be calculated.\n\n2. **Annual Interest Rate**: This is the percentage at which the money grows per year. It should be provided as a decimal (for example, an interest rate of 5% should be input as 0.05).\n\n3. **Compounding Frequency**: This parameter defines how many times the interest is applied to the principal per year. Common compounding frequencies include annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, or daily.\n\n4. **Time Period (in years)**: The total duration for which the interest will be compounded. This is usually expressed in years and represents the length of time the principal is invested or borrowed.\n\nAn edge case to consider is when the time period is zero, in which case no interest is accrued, and the principal remains unchanged. Similarly, if the annual interest rate is zero, the principal will not grow regardless of the time period or compounding frequency.\n\nExample usage of this function would look like this: Suppose you have a principal of $1,000, an annual interest rate of 5%, compounded monthly, for a period of 10 years.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.This function is designed to execute system-level commands on Windows operating systems by leveraging the `os.system()` method from Python's standard library. The `os.system()` function is a convenient way to interact with the operating system by sending commands as if they were typed directly into the command prompt. This function is particularly versatile as it is capable of executing not just a single command, but also multiple commands. When executing multiple commands, these can be effectively chained together using the '&&' operator, which ensures that each command is executed sequentially. The use of '&&' means that subsequent commands are only executed if the preceding command completes successfully without errors. This chaining capability is useful for scripts or operations that require several dependent commands to be run in a specific order.

The commands will be run in sequence, and each subsequent command will only be executed if the preceding command returns a success status. This is particularly useful for situations where you need to perform a series of tasks that depend on the successful completion of previous ones, such as building and cleanup tasks, or setup and execution steps.\n\nTo use this function, the command or series of commands to be executed must be passed as a string. Here is a simple example usage: if you want to change directories and list the contents of a directory, you could chain these commands in the following way: `os.system(\"cd some_directory && dir\")`. In this example, the command first attempts to change to `some_directory`. If successful, it proceeds to list the directory contents using the `dir` command.\n\nRemember that the `os.system()` call is synchronous, meaning the Python script will wait for the command to complete execution before continuing. Additionally, the return value of `os.system()` is typically the exit status of the shell command, with a return value of `0` generally indicating success and any non-zero value indicating an error.\n\nUsers should be cautious while using this function as executing system-level commands can pose security risks, especially if untrusted input is used to construct the commands. It is advisable to validate or sanitize inputs thoroughly before execution.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

This function allows you to run commands as if you were typing them directly into the Windows command prompt. It is versatile in that it can execute simple, standalone commands such as 'dir' to list directory contents or more complex sequences of commands.\n\nWhen executing multiple commands, these can be chained together using the '&&' operator. The '&&' operator is particularly useful because it ensures that each subsequent command is only executed if the preceding command completes successfully without errors. For example, a call to this function with the input `'mkdir new_folder && cd new_folder && echo File created > new_file.txt'` would first attempt to create a new directory named 'new_folder'. If this command succeeds, it will then change the current working directory to 'new_folder'. Finally, if the directory change is successful, it will execute the 'echo' command to create a file named 'new_file.txt' inside the new directory with the text 'File created'.\n\nThis function is predominantly used in scenarios where automated tasks or scripts require the execution of shell commands, such as in deployment scripts, build processes, or other system administration tasks.

Additionally, while using '&&' to chain commands, the execution of subsequent commands depends on the success of the preceding ones; if any command in the chain fails (returns a non-zero exit status), the following commands will not be executed.\n\nUsage example:\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Example of executing a single command\nos.system('echo Hello, World!')\n\n# Example of executing multiple commands\nos.system('cd C:\\\\ && mkdir test_folder && cd test_folder && echo File Created > file.txt')\n```\n\nIn this example, the first command simply prints \"Hello, World!\" to the console. The second example demonstrates a series of operations: navigating to the C:\\ directory, creating a new directory called 'test_folder', changing into this new directory, and finally creating a text file named 'file.txt' with the content \"File Created\".

This function is particularly useful for legal professionals, researchers, or business analysts who need to track legal proceedings between specific corporate entities over time. The function serves as a tool to assist in monitoring legal disputes and can be critical in evaluating the legal environment and potential risks associated with business relationships.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **companyA** (*string*): The name or identifier of the first company involved in the legal proceedings. This parameter is essential as it specifies one party in the court case, allowing the function to filter through court records effectively.\n\n2. **companyB** (*string*): The name or identifier of the second company involved in the legal proceedings. Similar to companyA, this parameter is crucial for the function to accurately find and compare court cases that involve both specified parties.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\nUpon execution, the function will search through a database or a collection of court records, filtering entries to locate cases where both companyA and companyB are listed as opposing parties. These records may include various types of legal disputes, such as civil litigation, patent infringements, or contractual disagreements.\n\nThe function will then analyze the filtered results to determine which court case is the most recent. The determination of \"latest\" is based on the date when the court case was officially recorded, filed, or decided upon, depending on the available data. The function returns comprehensive details about this latest case, which may include the case title, docket number, date of filing, court jurisdiction, and current status or outcome if available.\n\n#### Edge Cases and Considerations:\n\n- **No Cases Found**: If the search yields no court cases involving both specified companies, the function should handle this gracefully, possibly returning a message indicating that no relevant cases were found.\n- **Multiple Cases on the Same Date**: In scenarios where multiple", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"company1": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the first company."}, "company2": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the second company."}, "country": {"type": "string", "description": "The country in which the court case is located.", "default": "USA"}}, "required": ["company1", "company2"]}}, {"name": "find_latest_court_case2", "description": "Find the latest court case between two companies.

It helps in filtering out service providers who do not have availability matching the specified schedule or time period, thereby optimizing the match between users and providers based on real-time availability data.\n\n### Usage Example:\n\nA user looking for a plumber in the downtown area of a city who is available on weekdays during the afternoon can use this function by inputting \"plumbing\" as the service type, specifying \"downtown\" as the location, and choosing \"weekdays afternoon\" for availability. The function will then return a curated list of plumbers who meet all these specified criteria, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of finding the right service provider for the user's needs.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n\n- If no service providers meet all the specified criteria, the function might return an empty list, indicating that no matches were found.\n- The function should handle cases where the input criteria are too broad or too narrow, potentially offering suggestions for refining the search parameters to achieve more accurate results.\n- It is important that the function effectively manages scenarios where multiple providers", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["service_id"], "properties": {"service_id": {"type": "integer", "description": "The unique identifier of the service.

This is crucial for ensuring that the paint is applied evenly and effectively across the entire surface without running short or having excess. \n\nTo achieve this, the function takes two primary inputs:\n\n1. **Surface Area (required input):** This parameter represents the total area that needs to be covered with paint. It is typically measured in square units, such as square feet or square meters, depending on the region or preference. The surface area can be calculated based on the dimensions of the area to be painted, such as walls, ceilings, or any surface needing a coat of paint.\n\n2. **Coverage Rate (required input):** This input specifies how much area a single unit (often a gallon or liter) of the paint can cover. The coverage rate is usually provided by the manufacturer and can vary based on paint quality, type, and color. It is usually expressed in square units per unit of paint, indicating the efficiency of the paint in covering surfaces.\n\nThe function uses these inputs to compute the total amount of paint necessary by dividing the surface area by the coverage rate. The result gives the number of paint units needed to cover the area completely.

By leveraging location data, the function identifies stores within a specified radius of the user's current location or a provided address. The primary purpose is to cater to users who prioritize organic produce in their shopping choices.\n\n#### Key Features:\n\n- **Location-Based Search:** The function utilizes geolocation services to determine the user's current position or accepts a manually specified location to perform the search. This ensures that the results are relevant and geographically accessible to the user.\n  \n- **Organic Produce Focus:** Specifically tailored for users seeking organic options, the function filters grocery stores to highlight those that offer organic fruits and vegetables. This is particularly useful for individuals committed to maintaining an organic lifestyle.\n\n- **Customizable Criteria:** While the primary focus is on organic fruits and vegetables, the function may also support additional filtering criteria. These could include preferences for certain store types, brands, or other organic product offerings if such details are provided by the user.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Variable Product Availability:** Given that inventory can vary significantly between stores and even within stores over time, the function's results may not always reflect real-time stock levels. Users should verify with the store directly for the most current availability of organic products.\n\n- **Geographic Limitations:** In rural or less populated areas, the number of stores that meet the specified criteria might be limited, resulting in fewer search results. Users in such regions may need to expand the search radius or refine their criteria.\n\n- **Data Accuracy:** The function's effectiveness is contingent upon the accuracy and currency of the store data it accesses. Discrepancies in store listings or outdated information can affect the search results.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nTo use this function, a user might input their current location, either manually or via location services.

It operates by determining the city's time zone and calculating the current time based on that information.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `city_name` (string): This parameter represents the name of the city for which the current time is to be retrieved. The value should be a valid city name, typically formatted as a string. It is important to ensure that the city name is correctly spelled and recognized by the function's database or API to return the accurate time.\n\n**Functionality:**\n\nUpon execution, the function accesses a time zone database or API service to locate the time zone corresponding to the provided city name. Once the correct time zone is identified, the function calculates the current time by adjusting for the local time offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). It accounts for variables such as daylight saving time, which may affect the local time in regions that observe it.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n- If an invalid or unrecognized city name is provided, the function should handle the error gracefully, typically by returning a clear error message or a default value indicating the city was not found.\n- The function must be capable of handling cities in countries that have multiple time zones. In such cases, additional logic may be required to distinguish between different cities or regions within the same country.\n- The function should also manage any network issues or API failures in a robust manner, ensuring that it does not crash and provides informative feedback to the user.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\nSuppose a user wants to find out the current time in New York City, they would call the function with the parameter `city_name` set to `\"New York\"`. The function will then return a string or a datetime object representing the current time in New York, adjusted for Eastern Standard Time (EST) or Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), depending on the time of year.\n\n**Output:", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"city": {"type": "string", "description": "The city you want to know the current time for."}, "country": {"type": "string", "description": "The country where the city is located."}, "display_format": {"type": "string", "description": "The time display format: '12h' or '24h'.

The function typically requires three main parameters: the amount to be converted, the source currency code, and the target currency code. An additional parameter may include the exchange rate, which can be dynamically fetched from a reliable financial service or database.\n\nWhen using this function, it is crucial to ensure that the currency codes provided follow recognized standards, such as ISO 4217, which uses three-letter alphabetic codes to represent currencies (e.g., USD for United States Dollar, EUR for Euro). This ensures compatibility and accuracy in conversion processes. The function is robust in handling typical data types for numerical values, ensuring precision and accuracy in the result.\n\nEdge cases that the function may need to handle include extremely large or small monetary amounts, potential rounding errors, and invalid or unsupported currency codes.
