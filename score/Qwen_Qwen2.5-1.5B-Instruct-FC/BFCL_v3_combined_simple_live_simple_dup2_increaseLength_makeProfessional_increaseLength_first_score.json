The inputs to this function are the coefficients 'a', 'b', and 'c', which are necessary to define the quadratic equation.

When the 'root_type' parameter is set to 'real', the function will specifically return only the real roots of the equation. This is most applicable when the discriminant, calculated as b^2 - 4ac, is greater than or equal to zero. This condition ensures that the roots are real numbers.

It takes an input that specifies the food item the customer desires to select. The critical aspect of this function is its adherence to a specific requirement: the name of the food item provided by the customer must be in uppercase letters. This ensures consistency and prevents errors that could arise from case sensitivity in processing food item names.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\n- **Input Requirement:** The function expects the food item name to be passed as a string. It is crucial that this string is entirely in uppercase letters. For example, if a customer wants to select \"pasta,\" the input should be \"PASTA\" instead of \"pasta\" or \"Pasta.\" This requirement is in place to maintain uniformity in how food items are recorded and processed within the system.\n\n- **Selection Process:** Upon receiving the request, the function checks the provided food name against a predefined list of available food items. It confirms that the requested food item exists in the list and then updates the current selection to reflect the customer's choice. The function will only successfully execute if the food name matches an item in the list exactly, taking into account the uppercase requirement.\n\n- **Error Handling:** If the food name is not supplied in uppercase or does not match any item in the available food list, the function will not proceed with changing the selection. Instead, it will typically return an error message or code indicating the nature of the issue, such as \"Invalid food item name\" or \"Food item not found.\" This helps guide users to correct the input and resubmit their requests appropriately.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose a customer wants to change their selection to a salad. The function call should look like this:\n\n```plaintext\nchangeFoodSelection(\"SALAD\")\n```\n\nIn this scenario, \"SALAD\" is the correct input because it adheres to the uppercase requirement.

This calculation is based on the principles of classical mechanics, particularly those involving free-fall motion under the influence of gravity alone. The absence of air resistance implies that the only force acting on the object is gravity, which accelerates the object uniformly as it falls.\n\nTo achieve this calculation, the function typically utilizes the formula derived from the conservation of energy or kinematic equations, which states that the final speed \\( v \\) of the object can be determined using the equation:\n\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{2gh} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( g \\) represents the acceleration due to gravity, which is approximately \\( 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\) on the surface of the Earth.\n- \\( h \\) denotes the height from which the object is dropped, measured in meters.\n\nBy substituting the known values of \\( g \\) and \\( h \\) into this equation, the function computes the final speed at which the object impacts the ground. It is important to note that this calculation assumes the initial speed of the object is zero, as it is dropped from rest. Additionally, any effects of drag or lift due to air friction are neglected in this scenario to simplify the computation, which ensures a purely theoretical result based on ideal conditions.\n\nThis function is particularly useful in physics simulations, educational tools, or engineering calculations where a precise understanding of free-fall dynamics is required without the complexities introduced by air resistance. Here is a basic example of how to use this function:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_final_speed(height):\n    g = 9.81  # acceleration due to gravity in m/s^2\n    final_speed = (2 * g * height) ** 0.5\n    return final_speed\n\n# Example usage:\n# Calculate the final speed of an object dropped from 50 meters", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"initial_velocity": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial velocity of the object."}, "height": {"type": "integer", "description": "The height from which the object is dropped."}, "gravity": {"type": "float", "description": "The gravitational acceleration.

The parsing process involves analyzing the structured output from the LLM to ensure it meets certain criteria or expected patterns.\n\nA critical feature of this function is its ability to handle specific cases where the LLM may not be able to provide a suitable answer. In situations where the LLM output explicitly includes the phrase 'answer not found', the function will identify this as an indication of an invalid or unsuccessful result. Consequently, it will return an empty string to signify that no valid answer was generated.\n\nThis behavior is particularly useful in applications where the presence of 'answer not found' in the LLM output needs to be clearly distinguished from other types of valid responses.

This calculation is based on three critical parameters: the mass of the substance undergoing the phase change, the temperature at which the phase transition occurs, and the material's specific latent heat.\n\n- **Mass**: This parameter represents the quantity of the substance in question and is usually measured in kilograms (kg). It is crucial because the amount of energy required or released is directly proportional to the mass of the substance.\n\n- **Phase Transition Temperature**: This is the temperature at which the substance changes its phase, such as from solid to liquid or liquid to gas. It remains constant during the phase change process, as all the energy is used to alter the state rather than change the temperature. This parameter helps identify the specific phase transition taking place.\n\n- **Specific Latent Heat**: Specific latent heat is a property of the material and is defined as the amount of energy per unit mass required to change the phase of the substance without changing its temperature. It is typically measured in joules per kilogram (J/kg). There are two main types: latent heat of fusion (for solid-liquid transitions) and latent heat of vaporization (for liquid-gas transitions).\n\nBy accurately inputting these parameters into the function, the user can compute the total energy involved in the phase change.

The absolute pressure is a crucial measurement in various scientific and engineering applications, as it represents the total pressure exerted on an object, including both the atmospheric pressure and the pressure measured by the gauge. The function works by taking the gauge pressure, which is the pressure relative to atmospheric pressure, and adding it to the atmospheric pressure to obtain the true or total pressure in absolute terms.\n\n### Parameters:\n- **gaugePressure** (float): This parameter represents the gauge pressure, typically measured using a pressure gauge. Gauge pressure is the pressure relative to the ambient atmospheric pressure and is often used in scenarios where the atmospheric pressure is a constant baseline. It is measured in units such as pascals (Pa), pounds per square inch (psi), or bars.\n  \n- **atmosphericPressure** (float): This parameter denotes the atmospheric pressure, which is the pressure exerted by the weight of the atmosphere above the point of measurement. It is essential for calculating absolute pressure and typically has a standard value of approximately 101.3 kPa at sea level. However, this value can vary based on altitude and weather conditions.\n\n### Returns:\n- **absolutePressure** (float): The function returns the absolute pressure, which is the sum of the gauge pressure and the atmospheric pressure. Absolute pressure provides a comprehensive measure of the total pressure exerted on a system and is crucial for accurate calculations in systems where atmospheric pressure variations can impact performance.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- If either the gauge pressure or atmospheric pressure is negative, this might indicate an anomaly or error in measurement, and the function should be used with caution to ensure accurate results.\n- If atmospheric pressure is zero or unreasonably low, it could suggest a vacuum or an incorrect parameter input, potentially leading to an incorrect absolute pressure calculation.\n\n### Usage Example:\n```python\ngaugePressure = 500.0  # in pascals", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"atm_pressure": {"type": "integer", "description": "The atmospheric pressure in atmospheres (atm).

It could be any global or local cuisine such as Italian, Chinese, Indian, Mexican, or more niche selections like vegan or fusion. The function uses this criterion to filter restaurants that specialize in or offer the specified type of cuisine.\n\n2. **Location**: This parameter determines the geographical area where the user wants to find the restaurant. It could be a city, a neighborhood, or even a specific address. The function evaluates restaurants within this specified area to ensure they are accessible to the user.\n\n3. **Condition**: The condition parameter adds an additional layer of specificity. This could involve a variety of considerations such as budget constraints (e.g., looking for affordable options), dietary restrictions (e.g., gluten-free, kosher), or ambiance preferences (e.g., family-friendly, romantic setting). The function applies this condition to further narrow down the list of potential restaurants that meet the given criteria.\n\n**Functionality:**\n\nThe function operates by first compiling a list of restaurants that satisfy the specified cuisine type and are located within the designated area. It then applies the additional condition to filter this list further. Once the filtering process is complete, the function evaluates the ratings of the remaining restaurants. Ratings could be sourced from review platforms, customer feedback systems, or an aggregated scoring system.\n\nThe primary goal of the function is to identify and return the restaurant with the highest rating among those that meet all specified conditions.

The calculation of the area is based on the well-known mathematical formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\]\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **base**: A numerical value representing the length of the base of the triangle. This parameter must be a positive number, as a negative or zero value does not represent a valid geometric length.\n\n- **height**: A numerical value representing the perpendicular height from the base to the opposite vertex of the triangle. Similar to the base, this should also be a positive number, since the height must represent a measurable distance.\n\n#### Return Value:\nThe function returns a numerical value which corresponds to the area of the triangle. The unit of this area is determined by the units of the base and height. If both are in meters, the area will be in square meters, and so on.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nTo calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 5 units and a height of 10 units, you would call the function as follows:\n\n```python\narea = calculate_triangle_area(base=5, height=10)\nprint(\"The area of the triangle is:\", area)\n```\n\nThis would output:\n\n```\nThe area of the triangle is: 25.0\n```\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- If the base or height is zero, the area calculated will be zero, as a triangle cannot have a zero-length base or height in practical geometric terms.\n- Negative values for either parameter are not considered valid input and should be handled appropriately, possibly by returning an error or exception to inform the user.\n- Consideration should also be given to the precision of the input values and the resulting area, especially in applications requiring high accuracy.\n\nBy ensuring proper input validation and clear documentation of this function, users", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"base": {"type": "integer", "description": "The length of the base of the triangle."}, "height": {"type": "integer", "description": "The height of the triangle from the base."}, "unit": {"type": "string", "description": "The measurement unit for the area.

It is typically provided as a decimal, where a 5% return would be input as 0.05. The yield rate is crucial as it directly influences the growth of the investment over time.\n\n2. **Investment Amount**: This is the initial sum of money that is invested in the mutual fund.

The investment amount is essential for determining the scale of the potential returns, with larger investments leading to proportionately higher estimated returns, assuming the same yield rate and time period.\n\n3. **Time Period**: This parameter specifies the duration, usually in years, for which the investment is held in the mutual fund. The time period impacts the compounding effect, where longer durations typically result in greater overall returns due to the exponential growth facilitated by compounding interest.\n\nThe calculation process assumes the concept of compound interest, where the returns are reinvested and generate their own returns over time.

The server then processes this request and returns a summary that outlines any detected irregularities or deviations from expected performance or behavior within the specified insights group or fabric.\n\nAn insights group typically consists of a collection of metrics or data points that are monitored to identify unusual patterns or trends. Alternatively, a fabric may refer to a set of interconnected network elements that are analyzed to detect potential issues. By specifying the insights group or fabric, the function ensures that the summary is tailored to the relevant context, providing insights that are pertinent to the selected domain.\n\nIt is important to consider that the accuracy and relevance of the retrieved anomaly summary are dependent on both the correctness of the URL and the appropriateness of the insights group or fabric specified. Additionally, network conditions, server availability, and authentication requirements (if any) might affect the successful execution of the GET request and the subsequent retrieval of data.\n\nUsage example:\n\n```python\nurl = \"http://example.com/api/anomalies\"\ninsights_group = \"network_performance\"\nanomaly_summary = get_anomaly_summary(url, insights_group)\nprint(anomaly_summary)\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `get_anomaly_summary` is invoked with a URL pointing to the API endpoint and an insights group related to network performance, and it prints the resulting summary of detected anomalies.

This method allows the execution of commands directly from the command line interface of the Windows environment. One of the key features of this function is its ability to handle both single commands and multiple commands, which can be executed in succession. When multiple commands need to be run, they can be chained together using the '&&' operator. This operator ensures that the subsequent command will only be executed if the preceding command completes successfully, without errors. \n\nFor example, a single command such as `os.system('dir')` will display the contents of the current directory in the command prompt. If multiple commands need to be executed, they can be written as `os.system('cd .. && dir')`, where the `cd ..` command changes the directory to the parent directory, and if successful, the `dir` command lists the contents of that directory.\n\nIt's important to note that this method executes commands in a subshell and returns the exit status of the command. The exit status can be used to determine if the command was successful (typically indicated by a zero) or if an error occurred (indicated by a non-zero value).

Common types of fuel include gasoline, diesel, natural gas, and electricity, each of which has a specific carbon emission factor. This factor is used to convert the amount of fuel consumed into the corresponding amount of CO2 emissions.\n\n- **Fuel Efficiency**: This parameter is measured in terms of the distance the vehicle can travel per unit of fuel, such as miles per gallon (MPG) or kilometers per liter (km/L). Higher fuel efficiency means that the vehicle can travel further on less fuel, typically resulting in lower CO2 emissions.\n\nThe function combines these inputs to output an estimate of the total annual CO2 emissions produced by the vehicle.

If the dealer's hand is involved in this comparison, the dealer usually wins ties, unless variant rules apply.\n\n4. **Tie Situations**: When two or more hands have the same value without exceeding 21, the game often results in a push (a tie), especially between a player and the dealer, meaning the player neither wins nor loses the bet.\n\n5. **Dealer's Rules**: The dealer's hand is typically constrained by specific rules, such as hitting until reaching a minimum value (usually 17) or standing on soft 17 (a hand that includes an Ace counted as 11).\n\nFor a complete function, one would ensure to account for these scenarios and apply the rules accordingly to check the players' hands, including the dealer's, and determine the winner. \n\n**Example Usage**:\nSuppose the function is invoked with the player's hand and the dealer's hand as arguments.

Unlike simple straight-line calculations, this function incorporates terrain data to provide a more realistic measurement of distance that accounts for the physical characteristics of the landscape.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **Location A**: The starting point expressed as geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude).\n- **Location B**: The destination point, also expressed in geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude).\n- **Terrain Data**: Information about the terrain between Location A and Location B. This may include factors such as elevation, slope, and surface type (e.g., roads, paths, off-road).\n\n#### Usage:\nTo use this function, input the geographical coordinates for both the starting and ending locations, as well as detailed terrain data. The function will process these inputs to calculate a realistic distance that accounts for natural and man-made obstacles.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- **Flat Terrain**: If the terrain is uniform and flat, the calculated distance will closely approximate a straight-line or Euclidean distance.\n- **Complex Terrain**: In areas with varied elevation or obstacles, such as mountains or water bodies, the resulting distance will be longer than the straight-line distance, reflecting the need to traverse around or over these features.\n- **Inaccessible Areas**: If certain areas between the two locations are impassable, the function will attempt to find the shortest viable route around these obstacles.\n\n#### Example:\nSuppose two hikers are planning a trek from a base camp to a mountain summit. By inputting the coordinates of the base camp and the summit, along with terrain data that includes elevation changes and path types, this function will calculate the realistic trekking distance that accounts for the mountain's slope and any necessary detours along trails.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"origin": {"type": "string", "description": "Starting location of the distance measurement."}, "destination": {"type": "string", "description": "Destination location of the distance measurement."}, "consider_terrain": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether to account for terrain in distance calculation, defaults to false."}}, "required": ["origin", "destination"]}}, {"name": "distance_calculator.calculate2", "description": "Calculate the distance between two locations, considering terrain.This function computes the distance between two geographical locations, taking into account the terrain variations.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"origin": {"type": "string", "description": "Starting location of the distance measurement."}, "destination": {"type": "string", "description": "Destination location of the distance measurement."}, "consider_terrain": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether to account for terrain in distance calculation, defaults to false."}}, "required": ["origin", "destination"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"distance_calculator.calculate1": {"origin": "40.7128, -74.0060", "destination": "42.3601, -71.0589", "consider_terrain": true}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"distance_calculator.calculate1": {"origin": "40.7128, -74.0060", "destination": "42.3601, -71.0589", "consider_terrain": true}}], "possible_answer": [{"distance_calculator.calculate1": {"origin": ["New York", "New York City", "New York City, NY", "New York, NY", "NYC"], "destination": ["Boston"], "consider_terrain": [true]}}, {"distance_calculator.calculate2": {"origin": ["New York", "New York City", "New York City, NY", "New York, NY", "NYC"], "destination": ["Boston"], "consider_terrain": [true]}}, {"distance_calculator.calculate3": {"origin": ["New York", "New York City", "New York City, NY", "New York, NY", "NYC"], "destination": ["Boston"], "consider_terrain": [true]}}]}
