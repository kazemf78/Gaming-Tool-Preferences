The circumference is the total distance around the circle, which is a fundamental aspect of circular geometry. To perform this calculation, the function uses the well-known mathematical formula for the circumference of a circle: \\( C = 2\\pi r \\), where \\( C \\) represents the circumference and \\( r \\) is the radius of the circle. \n\nThe constant \\( \\pi \\) (pi) is approximately equal to 3.14159, though in practice, the function typically uses a more precise value as defined in the programming environment's math library.

This scenario simplifies the problem by eliminating drag forces, allowing us to focus solely on the effects of gravity. The calculation typically involves using the fundamental principles of classical mechanics, specifically the laws of motion and energy conservation.\n\nTo determine the final speed, the function employs the gravitational acceleration constant, typically denoted as \\( g \\), which has an approximate value of 9.81 meters per second squared (m/s\u00b2) on the surface of the Earth. The formula used in this calculation is derived from the conservation of energy, where the initial potential energy at the given height is converted into kinetic energy as the object falls.\n\nThe final speed (\\( v_f \\)) can be computed using the equation:\n\n\\[ v_f = \\sqrt{2gh} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( v_f \\) is the final speed of the object in meters per second (m/s),\n- \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity, approximately 9.81 m/s\u00b2,\n- \\( h \\) is the height from which the object is dropped, measured in meters (m).\n\nEdge Cases and Considerations:\n- If the height (\\( h \\)) is zero, the object does not fall, and the final speed will consequently be zero.\n- Negative values for height do not physically make sense in this context and should be handled as invalid input.\n- The function assumes the initial velocity of the object at the height is zero since it is dropped from rest.\n\nExample Usage:\nImagine you want to calculate the speed of a rock just before it hits the ground when dropped from a 10-meter-high cliff.

It searches based on certain criteria, such as the operating hours of each establishment, to ensure that the results are relevant and align with users' availability.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **Location**: The geographical area or specific coordinates from which the search will be conducted. This input is crucial to determine the radius within which the vegan restaurants will be located.\n  \n- **Operating Hours**: A filter criterion that allows users to specify the time frame during which they are interested in visiting a restaurant. This ensures that only restaurants open during these hours are considered in the search results.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\nThe function performs the following tasks to provide a list of vegan restaurants:\n\n1. **Data Collection**: It gathers data on vegan restaurants within the specified vicinity. This includes extracting information about each restaurant's menu, location, and operating hours.\n\n2. **Filtering by Operating Hours**: Once the list of potential restaurants is compiled, the function applies a filter based on the operating hours provided by the user. This step eliminates any restaurants that do not match the desired visiting time frame.\n\n3. **Distance Calculation**: The function calculates the distance from the specified location to each restaurant, helping to prioritize results that are closest to the user.\n\n4. **Result Compilation**: Finally, the function compiles a list of vegan restaurants that meet all specified criteria, sorted by distance, availability, or other user-defined preferences.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Non-Overlapping Hours**: If no restaurants are open during the specified operating hours, the function should handle this gracefully by either returning an empty list or suggesting alternate times or nearby locations with a higher probability of open establishments.\n\n- **Ambiguous Location**: If the location input is ambiguous or cannot be pinpointed to a specific area, the function should request additional information or provide a default search radius to proceed.\n\n#### Example Usage:\n\n```python\n#", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"location": {"type": "string", "description": "The city and state, e.g. New York, NY, you should format it as City, State."}, "operating_hours": {"type": "integer", "description": "Preferred latest closing time of the restaurant.

It is important to note that this function is restricted to sending just one value at a time, ensuring that the command received is clear and unambiguous. This limitation is particularly useful when precise control is required over the appliance's operations, as it prevents any potential conflicts that could arise from sending multiple commands simultaneously.\n\n### Usage Example\n\nSuppose you are working with a smart home system where you need to adjust the temperature setting on a smart thermostat. Using this function, you can send a specific temperature value, such as 72 degrees Fahrenheit, to the thermostat. The function call would look something like this:\n\n```python\nsend_command_to_appliance(72)\n```\n\nIn this example, `72` represents the single value being sent to control the appliance.\n\n### Parameter Explanation\n\n- **value (int/float/string)**: The command value to be sent to the appliance. This parameter represents the exact instruction the appliance will receive. Depending on the appliance's capabilities, this value could be an integer, a floating-point number, or even a specific string command understood by the appliance.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- **Invalid Values**: If the value sent is not recognized by the appliance, it may result in an error or the appliance may ignore the command altogether. It is crucial to ensure that the value conforms to the expected input range or format for the appliance being controlled.\n- **Network Issues**: In scenarios where the command relies on network communication, issues such as connectivity problems or latency might affect the successful transmission of the command. It is advisable to include error-checking mechanisms to confirm the command was successfully received and executed by the appliance.\n\nOverall, the function provides a streamlined method for issuing a single, distinct command to an appliance, making it an essential tool for tasks that require direct and specific control.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["body"], "properties": {"body": {"type": "dict", "description": "A dictionary containing the parameters for the appliance command.", "properties": {"airConJobMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The current job mode of the air conditioner.", "enum": ["AIR_CLEAN", "COOL", "AIR_DRY"], "default": "COOL"}, "windStrength": {"type": "string", "description": "The strength of the air flow.", "enum": ["LOW", "HIGH", "MID"], "default": "MID"}, "monitoringEnabled": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether air quality sensor monitoring is enabled.", "default": false}, "airCleanOperationMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The operation mode for the air cleaning function.", "enum": ["START", "STOP"], "default": "STOP"}, "airConOperationMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The operation mode for the air conditioner, indicating if it is turned on or off.", "enum": ["POWER_ON", "POWER_OFF"], "default": "POWER_OFF"}, "powerSaveEnabled": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether power save mode is enabled to conserve energy.", "default": false}, "targetTemperature": {"type": "integer", "description": "The target temperature to set for the appliance, in degrees Celsius.", "default": 20}, "relativeHourToStop": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of hours from the current time when the appliance should stop.

The function assumes that weight is given in kilograms and height in meters, as these units are standard for calculating body mass index (BMI), a common metric used in health assessments. \n\nThe prediction process typically involves calculating the BMI from the given inputs using the formula: BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) ^ 2). The resulting BMI value is then assessed against established medical thresholds or criteria that categorize different levels of diabetes risk. These thresholds are derived from epidemiological data correlating BMI with the prevalence of type 2 diabetes.\n\nSpecial attention should be given to ensure that the input values are within a realistic range for accurate predictions. For example, weights should be within human physiological limits, typically between 30 kg and 300 kg, and heights should be between 1.0 m and 2.5 m. Inputs outside these ranges may result in inaccurate predictions or errors.\n\nThe function is typically used in health care settings or wellness applications where a quick assessment of diabetes risk is needed.

This calculation involves integrating the polynomial function between two specified limits, which define the interval. The polynomial function can be represented in standard form as a mathematical expression consisting of terms with varying powers of the variable x, and may include coefficients for each term.\n\nTo compute the area, the function evaluates the definite integral of the polynomial from the lower bound to the upper bound of the specified interval. The result represents the total area enclosed between the curve of the polynomial and the x-axis within these bounds.\n\nWhen using this function, it is important to ensure that the polynomial is properly defined and that the interval is specified correctly. The interval is defined by two real numbers, where the first number is the lower bound and the second number is the upper bound. If the upper bound is less than the lower bound, the function may return a negative value, as it essentially computes the signed area.\n\nFor example, if the polynomial function is f(x) = x^2 and the interval is [1, 3], the function would integrate x^2 from x = 1 to x = 3, returning the precise area under the curve between these points. \n\nThis function is particularly useful for applications in calculus and analysis, where determining the area under a curve is a fundamental problem.

Invalid or misspelled intent names may result in misclassification or errors. Additionally, the user should handle scenarios where no intent is provided for a query, as this might require default handling or error reporting within the function.\n\nOverall, this function is a powerful tool for users who need to efficiently manage and record classifications across a wide range of queries.

This calculation involves determining how likely it is for a specific event to occur within a defined set of possible outcomes. It is expressed as a value between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates that the event cannot occur under any circumstances, and 1 indicates that the event is certain to occur.\n\nIn the context of this function, the probability is typically calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. For example, if you're rolling a fair six-sided die and want to calculate the probability of rolling a four, there is one favorable outcome (rolling a four) and six possible outcomes (one for each side of the die), so the probability would be 1/6.\n\nTo utilize this function, you would generally provide two parameters: the number of favorable outcomes and the total number of possible outcomes, both of which should be non-negative integers. The function then returns a floating-point number representing the probability, ensuring that the division is handled appropriately to maintain precision.\n\nThis function is particularly useful in a wide range of applications, from simple games of chance to complex statistical models. Users should be cautious when defining the inputs to ensure that the total number of possible outcomes is not zero, as this would result in a division by zero error, which is undefined in mathematics and would lead to a runtime error in most programming environments.\n\nHere's an example of how the function might be used:\n\n```python\n# Example usage:\nnumber_of_favorable_outcomes = 1\ntotal_number_of_possible_outcomes = 6\nprobability = calculate_probability(number_of_favorable_outcomes, total_number_of_possible_outcomes)\nprint(\"The probability of the event is:\", probability)\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `calculate_probability` is called with the parameters for a single favorable outcome and a total of six possible outcomes, which outputs the probability of approximately 0", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"success_outcomes": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of successful outcomes."}, "total_outcomes": {"type": "integer", "description": "The total number of possible outcomes."}, "format_as_ratio": {"type": "boolean", "description": "When true, formats the output as a ratio instead of a decimal.

A return value of 0 typically indicates that the command executed successfully, while a non-zero return value suggests that an error occurred during execution. It is important to note that since this function is intended for use on Windows, it will not behave as expected on other operating systems. Additionally, while using '&&' to chain commands, the execution of subsequent commands depends on the success of the preceding ones; if any command in the chain fails (returns a non-zero exit status), the following commands will not be executed.\n\nUsage example:\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Example of executing a single command\nos.system('echo Hello, World!')\n\n# Example of executing multiple commands\nos.system('cd C:\\\\ && mkdir test_folder && cd test_folder && echo File Created > file.txt')\n```\n\nIn this example, the first command simply prints \"Hello, World!\" to the console. The second example demonstrates a series of operations: navigating to the C:\\ directory, creating a new directory called 'test_folder', changing into this new directory, and finally creating a text file named 'file.txt' with the content \"File Created\".

This functionality allows for the execution of command-line operations directly from within a Python script, thereby enabling automation of tasks that would typically require manual execution through a command prompt.\n\nWhen using this function, you have the flexibility to execute either a single command or a series of commands chained together. Chaining is achieved by using the '&&' operator, which allows you to execute multiple commands sequentially. In this context, the '&&' operator ensures that each command is executed in order, and the subsequent command is only executed if the preceding command is successful. This feature is particularly useful for tasks that depend on the successful completion of prior commands.\n\nFor instance, if you need to navigate to a specific directory and then list the files within that directory, you could chain these commands as follows: `cd path\\to\\directory && dir`. This sequence first changes the current directory to 'path\\to\\directory' and, upon successful execution, lists the contents of that directory.\n\nIt is important to note that `os.system()` returns the exit status of the command executed, which can be used to determine if the command was successful. An exit status of zero typically indicates success, while any non-zero value signifies an error.

This function is particularly useful for users who need to access detailed information about a property for purposes like real estate transactions, legal verification, or assessment comparisons. \n\nThe function takes three primary parameters:\n\n1. **Location**: This parameter specifies the geographic area where the property is situated. It is crucial for narrowing down the search results to properties within the desired proximity or specific locale. This can be inputted as a city, town, or specific geographic coordinates, depending on the system's requirements.\n\n2. **Parcel Number**: This is a unique identifier assigned to a specific parcel of land. The parcel number is essential for pinpointing the exact property within a larger area, as multiple properties can exist within the same location or county. This parameter ensures that the search is precise and leads directly to the records of the property in question.\n\n3. **County**: The county parameter helps in further filtering the search results, which is particularly useful in regions where multiple areas might have similar or identical names. Including the county in the search criteria ensures that the records fetched are from the correct administrative region, thereby maintaining the accuracy of the information.\n\nThe function processes these inputs to access a database or a collection of property records, applying filters based on the input criteria to obtain and return the relevant data. It is expected to handle edge cases such as missing or incorrect inputs gracefully, possibly by returning error messages or prompts for correction, ensuring that the user is directed towards a successful retrieval of records.\n\nHere is an example of how this function might be utilized:\n\n```python\nproperty_records = fetch_property_records(location=\"Springfield\", parcel_number=\"123-456-789\", county=\"Greene\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the function call is intended to retrieve property records specifically from the Springfield area in Greene County that match the parcel number \"123-456-789\".", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"address": {"type": "string", "description": "Address of the property."}, "parcel_number": {"type": "string", "description": "Parcel number of the property."}, "county": {"type": "string", "description": "County where the property is located."}, "include_owner": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Include owner's name in the property record.

It serves as a critical tool for users who require accurate and up-to-date crime statistics, whether for research, analysis, or policy-making purposes. The term \"official crime rate\" refers to the measure of reported criminal activities in the city, typically expressed as the number of crimes per 1,000 residents or another standardized metric, over a specific period such as monthly, quarterly, or annually.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **city_name (string)**: The name of the city for which the crime rate is to be retrieved. This parameter must be a valid string representing a recognized city name, as listed in the corresponding crime data repository.\n\n- **time_period (string, optional)**: The specific time frame for which the crime rate is needed. Accepted values may include predefined periods like \"monthly,\" \"quarterly,\" or \"annually,\" depending on the available data frequency. If this parameter is omitted, the function defaults to the most recent annual data.\n\n#### Return Value:\n- **crime_rate (float or None)**: The function returns a numerical value representing the city's crime rate. If the specified city or time period does not exist in the database, the function returns `None`, indicating that the information is unavailable.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- If the `city_name` is not found in the database, the function will not raise an error but will instead return `None`.\n- In cases where crime data for the requested `time_period` is not yet available or is incomplete, the function will return `None`, as a safeguard against providing inaccurate information.\n\n#### Usage Examples:\n1.

The calculation is based on three primary factors: the distance the vehicle travels in a year, the type of fuel used by the vehicle, and its fuel efficiency.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n1. **Distance Traveled (annual_distance):** This represents the total distance covered by the vehicle over the course of a year. It is usually measured in miles or kilometers, depending on the preferred unit system. Accurate input of this parameter is crucial as it directly influences the resulting emissions calculation.\n\n2. **Fuel Type (fuel_type):** This denotes the type of fuel the vehicle uses. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, natural gas, and electricity. Different fuels emit varying amounts of CO2 when consumed, and this parameter allows the function to use the appropriate emission factor for the calculation. \n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency (fuel_efficiency):** This is a measure of how effectively a vehicle uses fuel, typically expressed in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). Higher fuel efficiency indicates that the vehicle can travel more distance using less fuel, thus producing fewer emissions for the same distance traveled.\n\n**Calculation Process:**\n\nThe core calculation involves determining the total fuel consumption for the given distance based on the vehicle's fuel efficiency. Once the total fuel consumption is established, the function applies the specific emission factor associated with the fuel type to calculate the total CO2 emissions. The emission factor is a standard value that indicates the amount of CO2 released per unit of fuel consumed.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n- **Extreme Values for Distance:** When calculating emissions for vehicles that travel extremely high or low annual distances, ensure that the inputs remain realistic. For instance, commuting vehicles may have significantly lower distances compared to long-haul trucks.\n\n- **Fuel Efficiency Limits:** Consider edge cases where fuel efficiency is unusually high or", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"distance": {"type": "integer", "description": "The distance travelled in miles."}, "fuel_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of fuel used by the vehicle."}, "fuel_efficiency": {"type": "float", "description": "The vehicle's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon."}, "efficiency_reduction": {"type": "integer", "description": "The percentage decrease in fuel efficiency per year (optional).

It takes into account three main parameters: the director, the genre, and the cast. The user can specify one or more of these parameters to refine their search. \n\nWhen specifying the director, the user is able to filter movies that are directed by a particular individual. If the user specifies a genre, the function will return movies that match this genre. However, if the user does not specify a genre, the function will still operate by considering the other criteria, such as the director and cast.\n\nAdditionally, the user can list specific actors in the cast parameter. The function will then search for movies featuring these actors. It is important to note that the genre parameter is optional, meaning the function will perform a search even if only the director and cast are specified, or just one of those criteria is provided.\n\nThis flexibility allows users to perform broad or highly specific searches based on their interests. For example, if a user is interested in movies by a certain director and starring a particular actor, they can input these criteria and receive a tailored list of results.

By specifying the name of a director, users can filter movies directed by that individual, thus narrowing the selection to include only those works which align with the director's unique style and vision. Similarly, the genre parameter enables users to target movies that fall within a particular category, such as comedy, drama, action, or any other preferred genre, ensuring the results cater to specific thematic interests.

This key provides the tonal center around which the chords will be organized, ensuring that the progression maintains a consistent harmonic context. For example, if the key of C major is chosen, the chords generated will be based on the notes of the C major scale, such as C major, D minor, E minor, and so on.\n\nThe second parameter determines the number of chords in the progression. This allows for flexibility in creating progressions of varying lengths, tailored to the musical form or section you are composing. Whether you need a simple four-chord progression for a verse or a more complex eight-chord sequence for a bridge, this parameter can be adjusted to meet your musical needs.\n\nThe function might include considerations for common chord progressions, such as the I-IV-V-I pattern, which is prevalent in many genres of music, from classical to pop.

This function is particularly useful for analyzing the performance trends of a player within a given timeframe, helping coaches, analysts, and enthusiasts make informed assessments.\n\n#### Parameters\n- **playerName**: A string parameter that specifies the full name of the cricketer whose average batting score is to be calculated. It is essential to provide the correct and complete name to ensure accurate retrieval of match data.\n- **numberOfMatches**: An integer parameter that indicates the number of past matches to consider for calculating the batting average. This value must be positive and can be adjusted to analyze different periods of performance, whether recent or more extended historical spans.\n\n#### Functionality\nThe function works by accessing a dataset or database that contains detailed records of cricket matches. It retrieves the scores achieved by the specified cricketer in the past number of matches identified. These scores are then summed and divided by the `numberOfMatches` to compute the average. This average provides insight into the player's batting performance over the selected period.\n\n#### Edge Cases and Considerations\n- **Insufficient Data**: If the `numberOfMatches` exceeds the total matches played by the cricketer, the function should handle this gracefully, possibly by limiting the calculation to the available matches and notifying the user.\n- **Data Availability**: Ensure that the function has access to a reliable data source containing comprehensive match records to prevent misinformation.\n- **Error Handling**: The function should include error-checking mechanisms to handle incorrect inputs, such as a non-existent player name or an invalid number of matches (e.g., negative numbers).\n\n#### Usage Example\n```python\n# Example usage of the getAverageBattingScore function\n\n# Calculate the average batting score for 'John Doe' over the last 5 matches", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"player_name": {"type": "string", "description": "Name of the cricket player."}, "matches": {"type": "integer", "description": "Number of past matches to consider for average calculation."}, "match_format": {"type": "string", "description": "Format of the cricket matches considered (e.g., 'T20', 'ODI', 'Test').

A standard deck consists of 52 cards, which are divided into four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit contains 13 cards, ranging from Ace to King. The total number of unique cards in the deck ensures various combinations and probabilities based on the desired card or suit.\n\nThe probability of drawing a specific card, such as the Queen of Hearts, is determined by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes in the deck. Since there is only one Queen of Hearts in the entire deck, the probability is calculated as 1/52.\n\nSimilarly, if the objective is to calculate the probability of drawing a card from a particular suit, such as hearts, the function considers the 13 possible favorable outcomes (all the hearts in the deck) against the total 52 cards.
