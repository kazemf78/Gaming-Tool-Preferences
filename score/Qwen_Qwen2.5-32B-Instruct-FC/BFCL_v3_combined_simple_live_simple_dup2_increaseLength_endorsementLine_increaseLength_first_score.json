The position of the hour hand is determined not only by the hour but also by the minutes that have passed since the beginning of that hour, as the hour hand moves continuously. Specifically, the hour hand moves at a rate of 30 degrees per hour, and therefore, 0.5 degrees per minute. For example, at 3:15, the hour hand is not exactly at the 3 o'clock position but rather slightly ahead, specifically at 97.5 degrees (90 degrees for 3 hours plus an additional 7.5 degrees for 15 minutes).\n\nThe minute hand, on the other hand, moves at a consistent rate of 6 degrees per minute as it completes a full circle, or 360 degrees, every hour. Therefore, at 15 minutes past any hour, the minute hand is positioned at the 90-degree mark.\n\nOnce the positions of both hands are calculated in degrees from the 12 o'clock position, the function determines the angle between these two positions. It considers the smaller angle formed between the hands, as this is typically the angle of interest.

It takes into account the yearly yield of the fund, the amount of money invested, and the duration over which the investment is held. By synthesizing these elements, the function provides an estimate of the potential financial return.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **Yearly Yield**: This parameter represents the annual percentage rate at which the mutual fund is expected to grow. It is typically expressed as a percentage. The yearly yield should reflect realistic market conditions and mutual fund performance metrics. For example, a yearly yield of 5% would be input as 0.05.\n\n2. **Investment Amount**: This parameter details the total sum of money that is initially invested into the mutual fund. It is crucial for determining the base from which returns are calculated. The investment amount should be a positive numerical value representing the amount in currency units (e.g., dollars, euros).\n\n3. **Time Period**: This parameter indicates the duration for which the investment is held. The time period is usually expressed in years and should be a positive integer or a decimal value. For instance, an investment period of 5 years could be entered as 5 or 5.0.\n\n#### Calculation Process:\n\nThe function employs the formula for calculating compound interest, adjusted for mutual funds. The estimated return is derived by applying the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Estimated Return} = \\text{Investment Amount} \\times (1 + \\text{Yearly Yield})^{\\text{Time Period}} \\]\n\nThis calculation assumes that the yield is compounded annually, meaning the investment grows at the yearly yield rate each year over the specified time period.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- If the yearly yield is 0, the function should return the original investment amount, as no growth would occur without yield.\n- Negative values for the yearly yield are generally not expected and", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"yearly_yield": {"type": "float", "description": "The yearly yield of the mutual fund as a percentage."}, "investment_amount": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial investment amount in the mutual fund."}, "years": {"type": "integer", "description": "The time period for which the investment is made in years."}}, "required": ["yearly_yield", "investment_amount", "years"]}}, {"name": "estimate_mutual_fund_return2", "description": "Calculate the estimated return on a mutual fund given the yearly yield, the investment amount and the time period.

Once invoked, the command string passed to `os.system()` will be executed as though it were typed directly into the command line interface.\n\nThe command to be executed must be provided as a string argument to this function.

The purpose is to enable the execution of commands that would typically be entered into the command line interface of the Windows operating system. This function is versatile as it can handle both single commands and a sequence of commands chained together using the '&&' operator. When multiple commands are chained with '&&', each command is executed in sequence, and the execution will proceed to the next command only if the previous command completes successfully. This functionality is particularly useful for executing complex command-line operations that require multiple steps to be performed in a specific order. It is important to note that `os.system()` returns the exit status of the command executed, which can be used to determine whether the execution was successful or if an error occurred. Usage of this function requires careful construction of command strings to avoid unintended consequences, especially when dealing with special characters or command injection vulnerabilities.\n\nExample usage:\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Execute a single command\nos.system('echo Hello, World!')\n\n# Execute multiple commands\nos.system('cd my_directory && dir')\n```\n\nIn this example, the first command prints \"Hello, World!\" to the command prompt, while the second example changes the current directory to \"my_directory\" and lists its contents only if the directory change is successful.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.This function is designed to execute system-level commands by utilizing the `os.system()` method specifically on Windows operating systems. The `os.system()` function is a part of the `os` module in Python, which provides a portable way of using operating system-dependent functionality. When using this function, users can execute not only singular commands but also multiple commands that are chained together using the '&&' operator. This chaining allows for the sequential execution of commands, where each subsequent command will only run if the previous one succeeds without errors. \n\nFor instance, executing `os.system('command1 && command2')` will attempt to run `command1` first. If `command1` executes successfully, then `command2` will be executed next. In the context of Windows operating systems, this can be particularly useful for executing a series of administrative or maintenance tasks that need to be completed in a specific order, such as updating software packages or configuring system settings. \n\nWhen using this function, it's important to note that `os.system()` runs the command in a subshell. This means it can handle environment variables and command path resolutions typical to the Windows shell environment. However, users should be cautious with commands that require user interaction, as `os.system()` does not provide a means to capture or respond to user prompts. Additionally, error handling should be considered, as the function will return the exit status of the command executed, which can be used to determine success or failure. \n\nHere is an example of how one might use this function:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Execute a single command\nos.system('dir')\n\n# Execute multiple commands chained with '&&'\nos.system('echo Starting process && dir && echo Process complete')\n```\n\nIn this example, the first command lists the contents of the current directory, while the second example demonstrates chaining commands where it first prints a message, lists directory contents, and then prints another message upon successful completion of the previous commands.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

The primary purpose of this function is to invoke a command interpreter that can process the specified command string.\n\nWhen using this function, you can execute a single shell command or multiple commands linked together using the '&&' operator.

This calculation is based on three critical input parameters: the distance traveled by the vehicle in a year, the type of fuel used by the vehicle, and the vehicle's fuel efficiency. \n\nThe first parameter, distance traveled, refers to the total number of miles or kilometers the vehicle covers over the course of a year. This data is essential as it directly impacts the total fuel consumption of the vehicle, which in turn influences the amount of CO2 emissions.\n\nThe second parameter is the fuel type, which specifies the kind of fuel the vehicle uses, such as gasoline, diesel, or alternative fuels like natural gas or electricity. Each fuel type has a distinct carbon emission factor, which determines how much CO2 is released per unit of fuel consumed. For instance, gasoline and diesel have different carbon contents and thus different emission impacts when burned.\n\nThe third parameter, fuel efficiency, indicates how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel, typically expressed as miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). Higher fuel efficiency implies that the vehicle can travel farther on a smaller amount of fuel, thereby reducing the overall CO2 emissions.\n\nBy combining these three parameters, the function calculates the vehicle's total annual CO2 emissions, providing valuable insights for individuals or organizations aiming to monitor and reduce their carbon footprint. The function assumes standard emissions factors and consistent fuel consumption across the distance traveled. It is important to use accurate measurements for each parameter to ensure the reliability of the emission estimates.\n\nUsage Example:\nAssume a vehicle travels 15,000 miles in a year, uses gasoline as fuel, and has a fuel efficiency of 25 miles per gallon.
