Absolute pressure is a critical parameter in various scientific and engineering applications, as it reflects the total pressure exerted on a system, including atmospheric influences. The function requires two inputs:\n\n1. Gauge Pressure: This is the pressure measurement that indicates the pressure relative to atmospheric pressure. It is typically measured using a gauge, which reads zero when exposed to the open atmosphere. Gauge pressure does not account for atmospheric pressure and is commonly used in situations where the pressure difference between the system and the atmosphere is of interest.\n\n2. Atmospheric Pressure: This is the pressure exerted by the weight of the atmosphere above the point of measurement. It can vary depending on altitude, weather conditions, and other environmental factors. Atmospheric pressure is often measured using a barometer.\n\nThe absolute pressure is calculated by adding the gauge pressure to the atmospheric pressure, following the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Absolute Pressure} = \\text{Gauge Pressure} + \\text{Atmospheric Pressure} \\]\n\nThis formula ensures that the absolute pressure reflects the total force per unit area exerted on the system, accounting for both the system's internal conditions and external atmospheric influences.\n\nEdge cases to consider include scenarios where the gauge pressure is negative, which can occur in vacuum systems, indicating a pressure lower than the atmospheric pressure.

Label encoding replaces each category with a unique integer, which is suitable for algorithms that can naturally handle categorical data.\n\nBy performing these preprocessing steps, the function ensures that the dataset is in an optimal format for training machine learning models.

It then returns the sum of the original purchase amount and the calculated tax, providing the total amount that should be paid by the customer. \n\nThe function takes two primary inputs: the purchase amount and the jurisdiction. The purchase amount is a numeric value representing the cost of goods or services before taxes are applied. This value should be non-negative, as negative values would not typically represent a valid transaction. The jurisdiction input specifies the geographical or regulatory area whose sales tax rules are to be applied. This could be a state, city, or other defined region with its own tax rate, and it determines the percentage rate used in calculating the tax.\n\nInternally, the function multiplies the purchase amount by the sales tax rate associated with the jurisdiction to obtain the tax amount. It then adds this tax amount to the initial purchase amount to arrive at the total amount with tax included. This total is then returned as the output of the function.\n\nUsers should ensure that the jurisdiction provided is valid and supported by the function, as different jurisdictions can have varying tax rates and rules. Additionally, the function assumes that the applicable tax rate for the given jurisdiction is pre-defined and accurate.

This involves determining the definite integral of the polynomial function over the interval, which is defined by its lower and upper bounds. The polynomial function is typically expressed in the form of a sum of terms, each consisting of a coefficient and a variable raised to an integer power. The integration process involves finding the antiderivative of the polynomial and evaluating it at the boundary points of the interval. By subtracting the value of the antiderivative at the lower bound from its value at the upper bound, the function yields the total area under the curve between these two points. This calculation assumes that the polynomial function is continuous over the interval and properly defined at the endpoints. The result can provide insights into the behavior of the polynomial function over the specified range, especially in applications requiring precise area measurements such as physics, engineering, and economics.\n\nEdge cases to consider include intervals where the function intersects the horizontal axis, as portions of the area could be negative, depending on the orientation of the curve. Additionally, if the interval has a zero length (where the lower and upper bounds are equal), the resulting area will be zero, as there is no length over which to integrate. Usage of this function is essential in scenarios where determining the accumulated value represented by a polynomial function over a specific domain is required.\n\nFor example, suppose you have a polynomial function f(x) = 2x^2 + 3x + 1, and you wish to find the area under this curve from x = 1 to x = 4. The function will calculate the antiderivative of f(x), which might be F(x) = (2/3)x^3 + (3/2)x^2 + x, and then evaluate this antiderivative at x = 4 and x = 1.

Allows for the bulk recording of query classifications in one function call.This function is designed to efficiently manage and record the classification of a large number of queries by associating them with specific intent names. It achieves this by leveraging keyword arguments, where each keyword corresponds to an intent name, and the associated value is a collection of queries that share this intent. By using this approach, users can perform bulk recordings of query classifications in a single function call, significantly streamlining the process.\n\n### Parameters\n\n- **intent_name**: Keyword arguments where each keyword represents the name of an intent. This acts as a label that describes the purpose or goal of the queries associated with it.\n\n- **queries**: The values that accompany each intent name keyword argument. These are the actual queries that need to be classified. They can be provided in various iterable forms, such as lists or tuples, allowing for flexibility in input data structures.\n\n### Functionality\n\nWhen you call this function, it processes each keyword argument, taking the name of the keyword as the intent and the corresponding value as the list of queries. The function then records the association between each query and its intent, effectively classifying them in bulk. This method is particularly useful for applications that require organizing a large number of queries systematically, such as natural language processing tasks, chatbots, or automated customer service systems.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- If no queries are provided for a given intent, the function will simply record the intent with an empty list of queries, ensuring that all intents are processed but without any associated data.\n  \n- If duplicate queries are provided under the same intent, the function will still record each instance, as this might be intentional depending on the use case (e.g., tracking frequency of certain queries).\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\n# Example of how to call the function with multiple intents and their associated queries\nrecord_classifications(\n    greeting=[\"Hello\", \"Hi there\", \"Good morning\"],\n    farewell=[\"Goodbye\", \"See you later\", \"Take care\"],\n    inquiry=[\"What's the weather", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["acc_routing_start", "atm_finder_start", "faq_link_accounts_start", "get_balance_start", "get_transactions_start", "outofscope"], "properties": {"acc_routing_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries requesting the bank routing numbers or account numbers."}, "atm_finder_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for locations of ATMs, specified in the format of 'City, State (abbr)', such as 'Berkeley, CA' or 'New York, NY'."}, "faq_link_accounts_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to linking accounts within the bank's system."}, "get_balance_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for account balances, available funds, or other financial balances."}, "get_transactions_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to viewing transactions, deposits, purchases, and transaction details."}, "outofscope": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries that do not classify to any other available intents."}}}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"record1": {"outofscope": ["what is the weather like"]}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"record1": {"outofscope": ["what is the weather like"]}}], "possible_answer": [{"record1": {"acc_routing_start": [], "atm_finder_start": [], "faq_link_accounts_start": [], "get_balance_start": [], "get_transactions_start": [], "outofscope": [["what is the weather like"]]}}, {"record2": {"acc_routing_start": [], "atm_finder_start": [], "faq_link_accounts_start": [], "get_balance_start": [], "get_transactions_start": [], "outofscope": [["what is the weather like"]]}}, {"record3": {"acc_routing_start": [], "atm_finder_start": [], "faq_link_accounts_start": [], "get_balance_start": [], "get_transactions_start": [], "outofscope": [["what is the weather like"]]}}]}

For strings, it returns the characters in reverse order. For booleans, it returns the negation. For numbers, it returns the negative value.The function is designed to take a single input and return its reversed or inverted form, depending on the type of the input provided. When the input is a string, the function processes it by reversing the order of its characters, effectively providing the string in a backward reading manner. For example, if the string \"hello\" is passed as input, the function will return \"olleh\". This operation is particularly useful for operations that require backward iteration or when comparing mirrored text forms.\n\nIn the case of boolean inputs, the function operates by returning the logical negation of the input value. This means if the input is `True`, the function will return `False`, and if `False` is provided, it will return `True`. This aspect of the function is valuable in scenarios where a toggle switch or logical inversion is required.\n\nWhen the input is a number, the function calculates and returns its negative value. This involves changing the sign of the number from positive to negative or vice versa. For instance, if the input is `10`, the function will return `-10`; similarly, if the input is `-5`, the function will return `5`. The function thus effectively inverts the numeric value, which can be particularly useful in mathematical computations where sign inversion is necessary.\n\nOverall, the function is versatile, capable of handling different data types, and performs distinct operations based on the type of the input. It is important to ensure that the input is of a type that the function is designed to handle, as providing unsupported types could result in unexpected behavior.

If the compilation fails, the executable will not run, preserving system stability and preventing errors from cascading. \n\nIt's important to note that while `os.system()` is a straightforward way to run commands, it doesn't provide the same level of security and flexibility as other methods such as `subprocess.run()`. Additionally, since this function executes commands as they are input, care should be taken to validate or sanitize any user input to avoid potential security risks such as shell injection. \n\nIn summary, this function leverages the `os.system()` call on Windows platforms, supporting single or multiple command executions linked by '&&', enabling complex task automation while demanding careful handling of command input to ensure system security and reliability.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

It does so by taking into account three primary parameters: the total initial investment amount, the annual yield rate, and the investment time period. These parameters are crucial for accurately determining how much the initial investment will grow over the specified time period.\n\n- **Total Initial Investment**: This parameter represents the amount of money initially invested in the mutual fund. It serves as the principal amount from which the investment will grow, based on the specified yield rate.\n\n- **Annual Yield Rate**: The annual yield rate is expressed as a percentage and signifies the expected rate of return on the investment each year. It is used to calculate the compound interest earned on the initial investment over the specified period.\n\n- **Time Period**: This parameter specifies the duration, typically in years, for which the investment will be held in the mutual fund. It determines how many times the annual yield rate should be applied to the initial investment.\n\nThe function employs the principles of compound interest to calculate the final balance. Compound interest involves reinvesting the earnings each year, so that interest is earned on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous years.

This capability is particularly useful for automating tasks that would otherwise require manual execution in the command prompt.\n\nWhen using this function, you can provide a single command as a string, which will be executed in the context of the Windows command shell. Additionally, it supports the execution of multiple commands in sequence by chaining them together using the '&&' operator. This chaining mechanism ensures that subsequent commands are only executed if the preceding command completes successfully without errors. For example, you could execute a sequence of commands like 'command1 && command2', where 'command2' will only run if 'command1' executes without any issues.\n\nAn important consideration when using this function is that since it leverages the `os.system()` call, it will only work correctly on systems where this functionality is supported, i.e., Windows platforms. Moreover, `os.system()` returns the exit status of the shell command, with a return value of zero indicating successful execution, and a non-zero return value indicating an error.\n\nExample usage of this function could be executing a simple command like 'dir' to list directory contents or a more complex series of commands such as 'cd C:\\ && mkdir new_folder', where it changes the current directory and creates a new folder. Proper error handling should be implemented when using this function to ensure that any issues during the execution process are appropriately managed.\n\nIn summary, this function provides a straightforward way to execute one or more system-level commands on Windows operating systems by utilizing Python's `os.system()` function, with support for command chaining using '&&' to ensure sequential execution based on the success of each command.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

The calculation is based on three crucial parameters: the distance traveled by the vehicle in that year, the type of fuel the vehicle uses, and the fuel efficiency of the vehicle.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n1. **Distance Traveled**: This parameter represents the total number of miles or kilometers the vehicle has traveled in a year. It is a critical factor, as greater distances typically result in higher emissions.\n\n2. **Fuel Type**: The type of fuel the vehicle uses significantly impacts the calculation. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, electric, and hybrid options. Each fuel type has a specific carbon emissions factor, which denotes the amount of carbon dioxide produced per unit of fuel consumed. This emissions factor is essential for accurately estimating the vehicle's carbon footprint.\n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency**: This represents how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel, usually expressed in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). Higher fuel efficiency indicates that the vehicle can travel further on a smaller amount of fuel, potentially reducing the total emissions.\n\n**Calculation Process:**\n\nThe function combines these parameters to estimate the annual carbon dioxide emissions. It considers the distance traveled and divides it by the vehicle's fuel efficiency to determine the total fuel consumed over the year. This result is then multiplied by the carbon emissions factor associated with the selected fuel type to calculate the total emissions in terms of carbon dioxide.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n- If the distance traveled is zero, the function should correctly return zero emissions, as no travel means no fuel consumption or emissions.\n- If the fuel efficiency is excessively high, it could result in minimal emissions even for significant travel distances, which should be correctly processed.\n- Different fuel types with different emissions factors must be handled accurately to reflect real-world differences in carbon output.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\nSuppose a vehicle travels 15,000 kilometers in", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"distance": {"type": "integer", "description": "The distance travelled in miles."}, "fuel_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of fuel used by the vehicle."}, "fuel_efficiency": {"type": "float", "description": "The vehicle's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon."}, "efficiency_reduction": {"type": "integer", "description": "The percentage decrease in fuel efficiency per year (optional).

It is particularly useful for managers, team leads, or project coordinators who need an overview of the projects their team is currently involved in. The function includes optional parameters that allow users to customize the list according to specific needs, improving the relevance and clarity of the information retrieved.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **team_id**: The unique identifier for the team whose projects are being queried. This parameter is mandatory and serves as the primary filter for the function, ensuring that only projects linked to this specific team are returned.\n\n- **exclude_inactive** (optional): A boolean parameter that, when set to `true`, will exclude any projects that are marked as inactive. This is useful for users who are only interested in active projects that require attention and resources. By default, this parameter is set to `false`, meaning that inactive projects will be included in the results unless this option is explicitly enabled.\n\n- **exclude_child_projects** (optional): Another boolean parameter that allows users to exclude child projects from the list. Child projects are typically those that are part of a larger parent project. Users might choose to exclude these to focus on standalone projects or parent projects. The default value for this parameter is `false`, indicating that child projects will be included unless the user specifies otherwise.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- If the `team_id` provided does not correspond to any existing team, the function may return an empty list or an error message, depending on implementation details.\n\n- When both `exclude_inactive` and `exclude_child_projects` are set to `true`, the resulting list will contain only active, standalone projects associated with the specified team.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose a project manager wants to retrieve a list of all active projects for Team Alpha without any child projects. The function call would look something like this:\n\n```plaintext\nretrieve_team_projects(team_id=\"alpha123\",", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["uuid"], "properties": {"uuid": {"type": "string", "description": "The UUID of the team for which to retrieve the project mappings."}, "excludeInactive": {"type": "boolean", "description": "If set to true, inactive projects will be excluded from the results.", "default": false}, "onlyRoot": {"type": "boolean", "description": "If set to true, only root projects will be returned, excluding any child projects.", "default": false}}}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"acl_api.AclApi.retrieve_projects1": {"uuid": "12", "onlyRoot": true}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"acl_api.AclApi.retrieve_projects1": {"uuid": "12", "onlyRoot": true}}], "possible_answer": [{"acl_api.AclApi.retrieve_projects1": {"uuid": ["12"], "excludeInactive": [true], "onlyRoot": [true]}}, {"acl_api.AclApi.retrieve_projects2": {"uuid": ["12"], "excludeInactive": [true], "onlyRoot": [true]}}, {"acl_api.AclApi.retrieve_projects3": {"uuid": ["12"], "excludeInactive": [true], "onlyRoot": [true]}}]}

When a user inputs a particular key, the function processes this information to generate the corresponding musical scale, which is a sequence of notes ordered by pitch. \n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `key`: A string representing the musical key for which the scale is to be determined. This key serves as the starting point of the scale and dictates the root note from which the sequence of notes will be derived. Keys can include both major and minor variations, such as \"C major\" or \"A minor\".\n\n**Returns:**\n\nThe function returns a list containing the notes of the musical scale associated with the provided key. Each note in the list is represented as a string and follows the traditional order found in music theory, moving stepwise from the starting key note to the octave.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\nWhen using this function, if the user inputs the key \"C major,\" the function would output the C major scale, which is [\"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"G\", \"A\", \"B\"]. This example demonstrates a straightforward application for major scales. For a minor scale, such as \"A minor,\" the function would output [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"G\"].\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\nThis function should correctly handle keys with sharps or flats, such as \"F# major\" or \"Bb minor,\" by accurately adjusting the scale notes to reflect these alterations. Additionally, it should be robust enough to manage invalid input by returning an appropriate error message or exception, guiding the user to provide a valid key input. \n\nBy efficiently identifying the sequence of notes for a specified key, the function serves as an essential tool for musicians, composers, and students of music theory who seek to understand or utilize musical scales in their work.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"key": {"type": "string", "description": "The musical key for which the scale will be found."}, "scale_type": {"type": "string", "default": "major", "description": "The type of musical scale."}}, "required": ["key"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"musical_scale2": {"key": "C# major", "scale_type": "major"}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"musical_scale2": {"key": "C# major", "scale_type": "major"}}], "possible_answer": [{"musical_scale1": {"key": ["C#", "C sharp"], "scale_type": ["major", ""]}}, {"musical_scale2": {"key": ["C#", "C sharp"], "scale_type": ["major", ""]}}, {"musical_scale3": {"key": ["C#", "C sharp"], "scale_type": ["major", ""]}}]}

This parameter is crucial as it narrows down the search to a specific geographic location, ensuring that the recommendations are relevant to the user's needs.\n\n- The second parameter, `review_rate`, is a numeric value that determines the minimum average review rating that a sushi place must have to be considered in the results. This parameter helps filter out sushi restaurants that do not meet a certain quality standard, as perceived by previous customers. It ensures that only sushi places with a review rating equal to or higher than this specified value are included in the final output.\n\n- The third parameter, `top number`, is an integer that indicates the number of top sushi places to return. This parameter allows users to limit the number of results based on their preference. For example, if a user only wants to see the top 5 sushi places, they would set this parameter to 5. The function then provides a list containing the specified number of sushi restaurants, ranked according to their ratings and other relevant criteria.\n\nBy combining these parameters, the function is able to generate a tailored list of sushi restaurants that are highly regarded within the specified city and meet or exceed the given review rate.

Similarly, if a user requests the time for \"Tokyo,\" the function will identify it as part of the Japan Standard Time Zone, which does not observe daylight saving time, making the calculation straightforward.\n\nBy considering these variations, the function ensures that it provides an accurate representation of the local time for any given city, regardless of location or time of year. This functionality is particularly useful for applications that require real-time data synchronization across different geographical regions or for users who need to manage activities in multiple time zones.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"city": {"type": "string", "description": "The city you want to know the current time for."}, "country": {"type": "string", "description": "The country where the city is located."}, "display_format": {"type": "string", "description": "The time display format: '12h' or '24h'.

This function takes as input a time value, typically represented as a datetime object, along with the source and target time zones. It then adjusts the time accordingly to reflect the difference between the two time zones, accounting for variances such as daylight saving time where applicable.\n\nTo ensure precise conversion, the function relies on a comprehensive database of time zone rules, which includes historical and future changes to time zone offsets. This makes the function robust in handling both standard time and daylight saving time adjustments.\n\nAn edge case to consider is when the conversion falls into a time that does not exist due to the forward clock change during the start of daylight saving time, or a time that occurs twice due to the backward clock change at the end of daylight saving time. The function should handle such scenarios by providing options to specify if the time should be adjusted to the nearest valid time or if an error should be raised.\n\nFor example, suppose the function receives a datetime representing 2:30 AM on March 14, 2023, in the Pacific Standard Time (PST) zone, and the target time zone is Eastern Standard Time (EST). The function will convert this to 5:30 AM on the same date, reflecting the 3-hour difference between PST and EST. Additionally, if the date falls on a time change day, the conversion should respect local rules for daylight savings adjustments.\n\nParameters for this function typically include:\n\n1. `datetime`: The original time to be converted, represented as a datetime object.\n2. `source_tz`: A string or time zone object representing the original time zone of the datetime.\n3. `target_tz`: A string or time zone object representing the time zone to which the datetime should be converted.\n\nUsage Example:\nIf you need to convert a meeting time for participants located in different parts of the world, this function ensures that everyone receives the correct", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"time": {"type": "string", "description": "The local time you want to convert, e.g. 3pm"}, "from_timezone": {"type": "string", "description": "The time zone you want to convert from."}, "to_timezone": {"type": "string", "description": "The time zone you want to convert to."}}, "required": ["time", "from_timezone", "to_timezone"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"timezone.convert1": {"time": "3pm", "from_timezone": "NYT", "to_timezone": "LDT"}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"timezone.convert1": {"time": "3pm", "from_timezone": "NYT", "to_timezone": "LDT"}}], "possible_answer": [{"timezone.convert1": {"time": ["3pm"], "from_timezone": ["America/New_York", "New York", "NYC", "New York City"], "to_timezone": ["Europe/London", "London"]}}, {"timezone.convert2": {"time": ["3pm"], "from_timezone": ["America/New_York", "New York", "NYC", "New York City"], "to_timezone": ["Europe/London", "London"]}}, {"timezone.convert3": {"time": ["3pm"], "from_timezone": ["America/New_York", "New York", "NYC", "New York City"], "to_timezone": ["Europe/London", "London"]}}]}
