accelerates at 4 m/s\u00b2 for 300 meters. I remember from physics that there are kinematic equations to use here. Since the initial velocity is zero, that should simplify things.\n\nThe relevant equation is v_f squared equals v_i squared plus two times acceleration times distance. Since the vehicle starts from rest, v_i is zero. So the equation simplifies to v_f squared equals two times acceleration times distance.\n\nPlugging in the numbers, acceleration is 4 m/s\u00b2 and distance is 300 meters. So v_f squared equals 2 times 4 times 300. Let me calculate that: 2 * 4 is 8, and 8 * 300 is 2400. So v_f squared is 2400. To find v_f, I take the square root of 2400.\n\nWait, what's the square root of 2400? I know that 49 squared is 2401, so the square root of 2400 is just a tiny bit less than 49. Maybe approximately 48.9898 m/s. That seems reasonable.\n\nI should check if I used the right function.

Returns a list of times in seconds, each representing the occurrence of a significant beat within the audio file.This function is designed to perform a comprehensive analysis of an audio file with the primary objective of detecting beats throughout the file. The detection process involves identifying the rhythmic pulses that are perceived as the basic unit of time in a piece of music. The function not only detects these beats but also applies a filtering mechanism to ensure that only beats meeting certain criteria are considered.\n\nThe filtering process is based on two main factors: confidence levels and timing. Confidence levels refer to the certainty with which a detected beat can be classified as significant, eliminating false positives or uncertain detections that may arise due to noise or indistinct audio features. The function discards beats with low confidence, ensuring that the final output consists only of those beats that are identified with a high degree of certainty.\n\nTiming, on the other hand, involves assessing the intervals and consistency of detected beats to maintain the rhythmic integrity of the music. This filtering ensures that only those beats that align with the anticipated timing patterns of the audio file are retained.\n\nThe output of this function is a list, where each element is a time value specified in seconds. These time values signify the exact moments within the audio file when significant beats occur. For instance, if a beat is detected at 1.5 seconds and another at 3.75 seconds, the function will return a list containing these values: [1.5, 3.75]. This output can be used in various applications, such as music visualization, synchronization tasks, or further audio processing.\n\nIn terms of usage, the function requires an input in the form of an audio file. This could be any standard audio format, such as MP3, WAV, or AIFF, depending on the function's implementation specifications. The function is typically invoked with a single argument representing the path or binary data of the audio file to be analyzed.\n\nOverall, the function provides an efficient way to extract meaningful rhythmic information from audio, making it a valuable tool for music producers, sound engineers, and developers working with audio data", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["capture_percentage", "confidence_window_size"], "properties": {"capture_percentage": {"type": "integer", "description": "Filters beats by excluding those below a specified confidence percentile.

For example, you might specify that you want to retrieve all records where a certain field value matches a given string, or where a numeric field falls within a particular range.\n\nThe function ensures efficient data extraction by leveraging the database's querying capabilities, often utilizing indexes and optimized search algorithms to minimize the retrieval time. It is important to handle edge cases such as empty query results, which could occur when no records match the specified conditions, and to manage database errors that might arise during the query execution.\n\nUsage Example:\nSuppose you have a database table named `employees` and wish to retrieve all records where the `department` field equals 'Sales'. You would call this function with the appropriate query parameters set to filter by the department field, ensuring the results contain only the relevant data.\n\nIn summary, this function is a powerful tool for accessing specific subsets of data within a database by applying precise queries based on clearly defined conditions.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"table": {"type": "string", "description": "Name of the table to query."}, "conditions": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"field": {"type": "string", "description": "The field to apply the condition."}, "operation": {"type": "string", "description": "The operation to be performed.", "enum": ["<", ">", "=", ">=", "<="]}, "value": {"type": "string", "description": "The value to be compared."}}, "required": ["field", "operation", "value"]}, "description": "Conditions for the query."}}, "required": ["table", "conditions"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\n[database.query1(table='users', conditions=[{'field': 'age', 'operation': '>', 'value': '25'}, {'field': 'job', 'operation': '=', 'value': 'engineer'}])]", "model_result_decoded": [{"database.query1": {"table": "users", "conditions": [{"field": "age", "operation": ">", "value": "25"}, {"field": "job", "operation": "=", "value": "engineer"}]}}], "possible_answer": [{"database.query1": {"table": ["user"], "conditions": [[{"field": ["age"], "operation": [">"], "value": ["25"]}, {"field": ["job"], "operation": ["="], "value": ["engineer"]}]]}}, {"database.query2": {"table": ["user"], "conditions": [[{"field": ["age"], "operation": [">"], "value": ["25"]}, {"field": ["job"], "operation": ["="], "value": ["engineer"]}]]}}, {"database.query3": {"table": ["user"], "conditions": [[{"field": ["age"], "operation": [">"], "value": ["25"]}, {"field": ["job"], "operation": ["="], "value": ["engineer"]}]]}}]}

It accomplishes this by determining the positions of each hand relative to 12 o'clock and then computes the angle formed between them.\n\n### How the Function Works:\n1. **Input Parameters**: The function requires two input parameters representing the time of interest: \n   - `hour`: An integer value ranging from 0 to 23, representing the hour portion of the time. This allows for calculation in both AM and PM formats.\n   - `minute`: An integer value ranging from 0 to 59, indicating the minute portion of the time.\n\n2. **Position Calculation**:\n   - **Hour Hand Position**: The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours. Therefore, it moves 30 degrees per hour (360 degrees / 12 hours). Additionally, for every minute that passes, the hour hand moves 0.5 degrees (30 degrees / 60 minutes).\n   - **Minute Hand Position**: The minute hand completes a full circle, or 360 degrees, in 60 minutes. Hence, it moves 6 degrees per minute (360 degrees / 60 minutes).\n\n3. **Angle Calculation**:\n   - **Raw Angle**: The function first calculates the absolute difference between the angles of the hour and minute hands.\n   - **Minimal Angle**: Since the clock is circular, the function determines the smaller angle. This is done by taking the minimum between the raw angle and 360 degrees minus the raw angle, ensuring that the angle is always 180 degrees or less.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- **Exact hour**: If the minute is set to zero, the calculation must handle the scenario where the minute hand is at the 12 o'clock position, and the position of the hour hand is straightforwardly `hour * 30` degrees.\n- **Midnight and Noon**: These times are special cases", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"hours": {"type": "integer", "description": "The hour on the clock face."}, "minutes": {"type": "integer", "description": "The minutes on the clock face."}, "round_to": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of decimal places to round the result to, default is 2."}}, "required": ["hours", "minutes"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\nThe angle between the hour and minute hands at 6:30 PM is 15 degrees.\n\n```json\n[calculate_clock_angle1(hours=6, minutes=30)]\n```", "possible_answer": [{"calculate_clock_angle1": {"hours": [6], "minutes": [30], "round_to": ["", 2]}}, {"calculate_clock_angle2": {"hours": [6], "minutes": [30], "round_to": ["", 2]}}, {"calculate_clock_angle3": {"hours": [6], "minutes": [30], "round_to": ["", 2]}}]}

The function returns the total amount with tax.The function is designed to compute the applicable sales tax for a specified purchase amount based on the sales tax rate of a particular jurisdiction. When provided with a purchase amount, the function determines the appropriate tax rate according to the given jurisdiction, applies this rate to calculate the sales tax due, and then adds the calculated tax to the original purchase amount. Consequently, the function returns the total amount payable, inclusive of the original purchase amount and the added sales tax.\n\n### Parameters:\n- **purchase_amount (float or int):** The monetary amount of the purchase before tax. It should be a positive numerical value representing the subtotal on which the sales tax will be computed.\n- **jurisdiction (string):** A string identifier for the geographical or political region in which the tax is being applied. This could be a state, province, or country, each having potentially different tax rates.\n\n### Return Value:\n- **total_amount (float):** This value represents the sum of the original purchase amount and the calculated sales tax. It reflects the total cost the buyer will need to pay, inclusive of the applicable sales tax for the specified jurisdiction.\n\n### Example Usage:\nSuppose a purchase is made in a jurisdiction with a sales tax rate of 5%. If the purchase amount is $100, this function will calculate a $5 sales tax, resulting in a total amount of $105 being returned. This ensures that the financial transaction reflects the correct tax obligations as determined by local laws and regulations.\n\n### Edge Cases and Considerations:\n- Ensure that the jurisdiction is correctly specified as the function relies on this to determine the correct tax rate. An incorrect jurisdiction could result in an inaccurate tax calculation.\n- The function assumes that the purchase amount is a valid numerical entry. Non-numeric or negative inputs should be handled appropriately to prevent incorrect outputs or errors.\n- It is important to verify that the tax rates for jurisdictions are up-to-date and correctly implemented in the function for accuracy.

This mathematical operation is commonly represented as base^exponent. The function takes two arguments: the first argument is the base, which is the number that will be multiplied by itself a certain number of times, and the second argument is the exponent, which specifies how many times the base is to be multiplied by itself. \n\nFor instance, if the base is 2 and the exponent is 3, the function calculates 2 raised to the power of 3, which results in 2 * 2 * 2, equaling 8. The function is capable of handling various types of exponents, whether they are positive, negative, or zero. A positive exponent indicates standard multiplication of the base, a negative exponent represents division (the reciprocal of the base raised to the absolute value of the exponent), and an exponent of zero will always result in 1, provided the base is not zero, as any non-zero number raised to the power of zero is defined to be 1.\n\nIt's important to consider edge cases when using this function. For example, if both the base and the exponent are zero, this is an indeterminate form in mathematics and may lead to undefined or implementation-specific results depending on the programming environment or library used. Additionally, the precision and range of the calculated result may be constrained by the data type or the system's floating-point arithmetic capabilities.\n\nUsage Example: \n```python\n# Calculate 3 raised to the power of 4\nresult = power_function(3, 4)\nprint(result)  # Output will be 81\n```\n\nIn this example, the `power_function` takes `3` as the base and `4` as the exponent, resulting in a calculation of 3 * 3 * 3 * 3, which equals 81.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"base": {"type": "integer", "description": "The base number."}, "exponent": {"type": "integer", "description": "The exponent."}, "mod": {"type": "integer", "description": "The modulus.

This method is particularly useful for applications that require organizing a large number of queries systematically, such as natural language processing tasks, chatbots, or automated customer service systems.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- If no queries are provided for a given intent, the function will simply record the intent with an empty list of queries, ensuring that all intents are processed but without any associated data.\n  \n- If duplicate queries are provided under the same intent, the function will still record each instance, as this might be intentional depending on the use case (e.g., tracking frequency of certain queries).\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\n# Example of how to call the function with multiple intents and their associated queries\nrecord_classifications(\n    greeting=[\"Hello\", \"Hi there\", \"Good morning\"],\n    farewell=[\"Goodbye\", \"See you later\", \"Take care\"],\n    inquiry=[\"What's the weather", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["acc_routing_start", "atm_finder_start", "faq_link_accounts_start", "get_balance_start", "get_transactions_start", "outofscope"], "properties": {"acc_routing_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries requesting the bank routing numbers or account numbers."}, "atm_finder_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for locations of ATMs, specified in the format of 'City, State (abbr)', such as 'Berkeley, CA' or 'New York, NY'."}, "faq_link_accounts_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to linking accounts within the bank's system."}, "get_balance_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for account balances, available funds, or other financial balances."}, "get_transactions_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to viewing transactions, deposits, purchases, and transaction details."}, "outofscope": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries that do not classify to any other available intents."}}}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\n[record1(outofscope=[\"what is the weather like\"])]\n\n```json\n[record1(outofscope=[\"what is the weather like\"])]\n```", "possible_answer": [{"record1": {"acc_routing_start": [], "atm_finder_start": [], "faq_link_accounts_start": [], "get_balance_start": [], "get_transactions_start": [], "outofscope": [["what is the weather like"]]}}, {"record2": {"acc_routing_start": [], "atm_finder_start": [], "faq_link_accounts_start": [], "get_balance_start": [], "get_transactions_start": [], "outofscope": [["what is the weather like"]]}}, {"record3": {"acc_routing_start": [], "atm_finder_start": [], "faq_link_accounts_start": [], "get_balance_start": [], "get_transactions_start": [], "outofscope": [["what is the weather like"]]}}]}

It typically categorizes two different categorical variables, each having two levels or values, allowing for statistical analysis of whether these two variables are independent or associated.\n\nThe Chi-Squared test for independence is a statistical hypothesis test intended to determine if there is a significant association between the two categorical variables. In this context, the null hypothesis posits that the variables are independent, meaning there is no association between the two.

The NPV calculation is fundamental in financial analysis as it aids in determining the value of an investment by discounting future cash flows to their present value, thereby allowing for an assessment of profitability.\n\nTo perform this calculation, the function requires a series of cash flows, which are usually represented as a list or an array, where each element corresponds to a cash flow occurring at a specific time period. These cash flows may include both incoming cash, such as revenue, and outgoing cash, such as expenses or initial investments.\n\nThe function also requires an interest rate, often called the discount rate, which is a critical parameter in the NPV calculation. The discount rate reflects the time value of money, risk associated with the investment, and opportunity cost. It's used to discount future cash flows back to their present value, providing a comprehensive view of the project's worth today.\n\nFor each cash flow in the series, the function applies the formula for Net Present Value: NPV = \u03a3 (C_t / (1 + r)^t), where C_t represents the cash flow at time t, r is the discount rate, and t is the time period. This formula ensures that each future cash flow is appropriately adjusted for the time value of money.\n\nEdge cases to consider when using this function include scenarios where cash flows are zero or negative across all periods, which would result in an NPV of zero or a negative value, respectively.

It bases its calculations on three key financial inputs: the purchase price of the stock, the sale price of the stock, and any dividends received during the holding period of the investment. By taking these inputs into account, the function provides a comprehensive measure of the investment's profitability over time.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **Purchase Price**: This is the initial cost at which the stock was bought. It represents the amount paid per share at the time of investment. The purchase price is a crucial input since it forms the baseline against which the sale price is compared to determine capital gains or losses.\n\n2. **Sale Price**: This is the price at which the stock is sold. It indicates the per-share amount received upon selling the stock. The sale price is compared to the purchase price to calculate the gain or loss from the investment. A higher sale price relative to the purchase price suggests a capital gain, whereas a lower sale price implies a capital loss.\n\n3. **Dividends Received**: These are the total dividends paid to the investor during the period the stock was held. Dividends are distributions of a portion of a company's earnings to its shareholders and are considered an integral part of the ROI calculation as they contribute directly to the investor's profit.\n\n#### Calculation:\n\nThe ROI is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROI} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{(Sale Price - Purchase Price) + Dividends Received}}{\\text{Purchase Price}} \\right) \\times 100 \\% \\]\n\nThis formula allows the investor to see the percentage return achieved on the stock, taking into account both the capital gain/loss and any additional income from dividends.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose an investor buys a stock for $100 per share.

Compounded interest is a method where the interest amount is added to the principal, and then the subsequent interest is calculated on the new total, which includes previously accumulated interest. This results in exponential growth of the investment or loan over time.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **Principal (P)**: This is the initial amount of money that is either invested or borrowed. It is the base amount on which interest will be calculated. This should be a non-negative number.\n\n2. **Interest Rate (r)**: This represents the percentage at which the principal amount earns interest over each compounding period. It is typically expressed as an annual rate in decimal form. For example, a 5% annual interest rate would be input as 0.05.\n\n3. **Period (n)**: The number of times that interest is compounded per year. This is usually a positive integer. Common compounding intervals include annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, daily, etc. The choice of compounding period significantly affects the amount of interest accrued over time.\n\n#### Return Value:\n\nThe function returns the total compounded amount after applying the interest for the given period. This amount consists of the original principal plus the accumulated interest.\n\n#### Formula:\n\nThe formula used to calculate the compounded interest is:\n\\[ A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt} \\]\nwhere:\n- \\( A \\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- \\( P \\) is the principal amount (the initial deposit or loan amount).\n- \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n- \\( n \\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per unit year.\n- \\( t \\) is the number of years the money is invested or borrowed", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"principal": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial principal."}, "interest_rate": {"type": "float", "description": "The annual interest rate."}, "period": {"type": "integer", "description": "The period in years."}, "compounding_frequency": {"type": "string", "description": "The frequency of compounding per year.

Additionally, because this function invokes the system shell, proper caution should be taken to prevent any security risks such as code injection, especially if the command string is constructed from user inputs.\n\nIn summary, this function provides a powerful way to execute system commands on Windows via Python, supporting both single-command execution and complex command chains, while requiring careful management of command syntax and security considerations.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

It is a critical factor, as greater distances typically result in higher emissions.\n\n2. **Fuel Type**: The type of fuel the vehicle uses significantly impacts the calculation. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, electric, and hybrid options. Each fuel type has a specific carbon emissions factor, which denotes the amount of carbon dioxide produced per unit of fuel consumed. This emissions factor is essential for accurately estimating the vehicle's carbon footprint.\n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency**: This represents how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel, usually expressed in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). Higher fuel efficiency indicates that the vehicle can travel further on a smaller amount of fuel, potentially reducing the total emissions.\n\n**Calculation Process:**\n\nThe function combines these parameters to estimate the annual carbon dioxide emissions.

The function operates by filtering movies based on three primary attributes: the director of the movie, the genre, and members of the cast. Each of these attributes plays a crucial role in the search query to ensure that the results align closely with the user's interests.\n\n#### Parameters:\n1. **Director**: The name of the director is a key parameter for this function. It allows the user to filter movies directed by a particular filmmaker, enabling them to explore a director's body of work or discover new films by a director they admire.\n\n2. **Genre**: This parameter allows the user to specify the type or category of movie they are interested in. Whether the user is in the mood for a comedy, drama, action, thriller, or any other genre, this filter ensures that the movies retrieved align with the specified genre preference.\n\n3. **Cast**: Users can specify one or more actors or actresses to filter movies featuring these cast members. This is particularly useful for fans of specific performers who wish to explore their filmography or discover new works they have participated in.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nSuppose a user wishes to find movies directed by \"Christopher Nolan,\" within the \"Science Fiction\" genre, and starring \"Leonardo DiCaprio.\" By inputting these criteria into the function, the user would receive a list of movies that match all these attributes, such as \"Inception.\" This ensures a highly personalized and relevant movie discovery experience.\n\n#### Considerations:\n- If a user specifies only one or two of the parameters, the function will still retrieve movies based on the available criteria, thereby offering flexibility in how the search is conducted.\n- In cases where no movies match all the criteria provided, the function should ideally return an empty list, indicating that no such films are found within the database or collection being queried.\n\nThis functionality is particularly useful", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": [], "properties": {"directed_by": {"type": "string", "description": "Director of the movie.

The primary purpose of this function is to handle raw fMRI data, which may consist of complex time-series information captured from brain scans, and apply various analytical techniques to extract meaningful insights. \n\n#### Input\n- **fMRI Data**: The function accepts fMRI data, which typically comprises three-dimensional or four-dimensional datasets that represent brain activity over time. This data is usually formatted in standard neuroimaging file formats, such as NIfTI or DICOM. The input may also contain metadata that provides additional context or information necessary for proper analysis.\n\n#### Process\n- The function employs a series of analytical methods to process the input data. These methods may include pre-processing steps such as motion correction, spatial normalization, and temporal filtering. The analysis may also involve statistical techniques to identify patterns of brain activity, connectivity assessments to examine neural networks, or machine learning approaches to classify or predict specific cognitive states or responses.\n\n#### Output\n- **Analyzed Data**: The result of the function is a set of analyzed data that provides insights into the brain's activity patterns. This output can be in the form of statistical maps, graphs representing neural connectivity, or other data visualizations that highlight significant findings. The analyzed data is typically ready for further interpretation by researchers or clinicians.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n- The function should handle cases where the input data is incomplete or contains artifacts that could affect analysis. It should be robust enough to manage variability in data quality and accommodate different scanning protocols or resolutions.\n\n#### Usage Example\n```python\n# Example usage of the function\nraw_fmri_data = load_fmri_data(file_path)\nanalyzed_results = analyze_fmri_data(raw_fmri_data)\ndisplay_results(analyzed_results)\n```\n\nThis function is essential for neuroscientists and researchers who require efficient and accurate", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"data_source": {"type": "string", "description": "The path where the data is stored."}, "sequence_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of fMRI sequence"}, "smooth": {"type": "integer", "description": "Spatial smoothing FWHM.

By leveraging the powerful search capabilities of Spotify, the function allows users to input a query that can include parts of the song title, artist name, album, or other related metadata. Upon receiving the query, the function initiates a search within Spotify's extensive music library to find the best match or list of matches that correspond to the user's input.\n\nOnce the function identifies the correct song from the search results, it proceeds to play the song through the Spotify platform. The function ensures that the song is played using the user's Spotify account, provided that the account is authenticated and has the necessary permissions to play music through the service.\n\n#### Parameter Explanation\n\n- **query**: The query parameter is a string that represents the search term or terms the user wishes to use to find a song on Spotify. This can be a fragment or complete song title, the artist's name, album name, or a combination thereof. The query should be formulated to maximize the accuracy of the search results.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\nSuppose a user wants to listen to \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by Queen. The user can call the function with the query parameter set to \"Bohemian Rhapsody Queen\" or simply \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" to search for the song. The function will then search Spotify's library, identify the track, and proceed to play it.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n\n- If the query does not correspond to any identifiable song, the function should handle this scenario gracefully, possibly by returning an error message or prompt indicating that no match was found.\n- If multiple songs match the query closely, the function may either play the first result or prompt the user to choose from a list of possible matches.\n- The function requires an active internet connection and a valid Spotify account with streaming permissions to function correctly.

It aims to provide a seamless experience for users by directly connecting their search inputs to Spotify's vast music library and initiating playback of the desired track.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **query (string):** A string that represents the search term or phrase used to find a song on Spotify. This could include the song title, artist name, album title, or any combination of these elements to increase the accuracy of the search results.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\nUpon receiving the query, the function interacts with Spotify's search API to locate a song that matches the terms provided by the user. The search is conducted in real-time, leveraging Spotify's powerful search algorithms to navigate through its extensive catalogue of music tracks, albums, and artists. Once a relevant match is found, the function proceeds to play the song immediately, allowing for an intuitive and efficient user experience.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Ambiguous Queries:** If the query can lead to multiple potential matches (e.g., common song titles or artist names), the function might select the most popular or most recent track by default, unless additional logic is implemented to refine the selection.\n\n- **No Results:** In instances where the search query does not return any results, the function should have a mechanism to handle this gracefully, possibly by notifying the user that no match was found, and suggesting alternative queries or corrections.\n\n- **Playback Restrictions:** Depending on the user's Spotify account type (free or premium) and regional restrictions, some functionality such as playback might be limited or unavailable. It is essential for the function to consider these limitations and provide appropriate feedback or fallbacks.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\n```python\n# Example usage of the search_and_play function\nsearch_and_play(\"Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the function would search Spotify for the song \"Bohemian Rhapsody\"", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["query"], "properties": {"query": {"type": "string", "description": "The search query for the song.

The league parameter defines the specific sports organization or competition, such as the NBA, Premier League, or NFL, while the season parameter indicates the time frame under consideration, often denoted by a year or range of years, such as \"2022\" or \"2022-2023\". The team parameter should accurately represent the name or unique identifier of the sports team in question. The function processes these inputs to locate the relevant data and outputs the ranking as an integer, where a lower number indicates a higher rank (e.g., 1st place). It is essential to ensure that the team name is spelled correctly and corresponds to the team as listed in the league records to obtain accurate results. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the team does not exist in the specified league or season, in which case the function might return a null value or an error message indicating that the team ranking could not be found. This function is invaluable for sports analysts, fans, and enthusiasts who are tracking the competitive standings of teams throughout different seasons.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"team": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the team."}, "league": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the sports league."}, "season": {"type": "string", "description": "The season for which ranking needs to be obtained."}}, "required": ["team", "league", "season"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\nsports_ranking1(team='Barcelona', league='La Liga', season='2021/2022')", "model_result_decoded": [{"sports_ranking1": {"team": "Barcelona", "league": "La Liga", "season": "2021/2022"}}], "possible_answer": [{"sports_ranking1": {"team": ["Barcelona", "FC Barcelona"], "league": ["La Liga"], "season": ["2021"]}}, {"sports_ranking2": {"team": ["Barcelona", "FC Barcelona"], "league": ["La Liga"], "season": ["2021"]}}, {"sports_ranking3": {"team": ["Barcelona", "FC Barcelona"], "league": ["La Liga"], "season": ["2021"]}}]}
