When a user inputs a number into this function, the function calculates and returns a list of prime numbers that, when multiplied together, result in the original number. This is a critical operation in various areas of mathematics and computer science, such as cryptography, number theory, and algorithm design.\n\nThe function works by iterating through possible divisors, starting from the smallest prime number, which is 2. It systematically checks and divides the input number by these divisors to determine if they are factors. If a divisor is a factor, it is stored in the list of prime factors, and the division process continues with the quotient. The function continues this process until the input number has been reduced to 1, ensuring all factors are prime.\n\nThis function handles edge cases such as input numbers that are less than or equal to 1, where it typically returns an empty list because there are no prime factors to be found. Similarly, for a prime number input, the function will simply return a list containing the number itself, as a prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.\n\nHere is a basic example of how the function might be used:\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(n):\n    i = 2\n    factors = []\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i:\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            n //= i\n            factors.append(i)\n    if n > 1:\n        factors.append(n)\n    return factors\n\n# Example usage:\nnumber = 28\nprint(prime_factors(number))  # Output: [2, 2, 7]\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `prime_factors` takes the integer 28 as input and returns the list `[2, 2, 7]`, which are the prime numbers that multiply together to yield 28.

This calculation is based on three critical parameters: the mass of the substance, the temperature at which the phase change occurs (known as the phase transition temperature), and the specific latent heat of the substance.\n\n1. **Mass**: This parameter is the amount of the substance undergoing the phase change, typically measured in kilograms. The mass directly influences the total energy change, as it determines how much of the substance is involved in the process.\n\n2. **Phase Transition Temperature**: This is the specific temperature at which the substance undergoes a phase change, such as melting, freezing, boiling, or condensing. It is important to note that during a phase change, the temperature of the substance remains constant, even though energy is being absorbed or released.\n\n3. **Specific Latent Heat**: This parameter is a measure of the amount of energy per unit mass required to change the phase of a substance without changing its temperature. It is typically expressed in joules per kilogram (J/kg). There are different types of specific latent heat for different phase changes, such as the latent heat of fusion for solid to liquid transitions and the latent heat of vaporization for liquid to gas transitions.\n\nThe energy calculated by the function can be positive or negative. A positive value indicates that energy is required to effect the phase change, such as when melting ice into water or boiling water into steam. Conversely, a negative value signifies that energy is released during the process, such as when water freezes into ice or steam condenses into liquid water.\n\n**Usage Example**:\nTo use the function effectively, one must provide the mass of the substance, its phase transition temperature, and its specific latent heat.

It prepares data for machine learning models, ensuring numerical values are scaled properly and categorical variables are appropriately transformed.This function is designed to preprocess input data in preparation for machine learning models by applying a series of transformations, specifically normalization and encoding of categorical variables. The preprocessing step is a crucial part of the data preparation pipeline, as it ensures that the input data is in a suitable format for model training and prediction. \n\nNormalization is applied to the numerical values within the dataset. This process adjusts the scale of the numerical features so that they contribute equally to the model's learning process. By scaling these values, the function helps to eliminate potential biases that could arise from differences in the range or units of measurement among the features. Normalization typically involves transforming the data to a standard range, such as 0 to 1, or adjusting it to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.\n\nIn addition to normalization, this function handles categorical variables by encoding them into numerical representations. Categorical variables, which contain discrete values or categories, must be transformed into a numerical format for most machine learning algorithms to process them effectively. The function achieves this by applying techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding. One-hot encoding represents each category as a separate binary feature, while label encoding assigns an integer value to each category. By converting categorical variables in this manner, the function ensures that these features can be utilized effectively in the modeling process.\n\nThe combined effect of normalization and encoding prepares the dataset by maintaining the integrity and usefulness of data while ensuring that all variables are transformed in a way that is compatible with machine learning algorithms.

The function returns the total amount with tax.This function is designed to calculate the applicable sales tax for a specified purchase amount, based on the tax rate of a particular jurisdiction. It takes two primary inputs: the purchase amount, which is the original cost of goods or services before tax, and the jurisdiction, which determines the applicable tax rate. The jurisdiction can be a state, county, or city, depending on the level of detail required for tax calculation. The function internally retrieves the correct sales tax rate for the given jurisdiction, ensuring that the calculation aligns with local tax laws and regulations.\n\nOnce the correct tax rate is applied to the purchase amount, the function calculates the sales tax by multiplying the purchase amount by the jurisdiction's tax rate. It then adds this calculated tax to the original purchase amount to determine the total amount due, inclusive of tax. This total, which includes both the original purchase amount and the calculated sales tax, is returned as the final output of the function.\n\nEdge cases handled by the function may include scenarios where the jurisdiction does not have a sales tax or when the purchase amount is zero, in which cases the function will simply return the original purchase amount. The function also accounts for jurisdictions that might have varying tax rates for different types of goods or services, ensuring accurate computation. \n\nExample usage of this function might include a call where a user specifies a purchase amount of $100 and a jurisdiction identified as \"New York City.\" The function would then apply the appropriate tax rate for New York City to the $100 purchase amount and return the total amount including tax.

It achieves this by performing an integration of the polynomial expression between two defined bounds, which represent the start and end points of the interval on the x-axis. The polynomial function is typically expressed in the standard form, where each term is a coefficient multiplied by the variable raised to an exponent. The user must provide the polynomial, usually as a list or array of coefficients, starting from the highest degree to the constant term. Additionally, the user must specify the lower and upper limits of the interval over which the integration is to be carried out. These limits are numerical values representing the x-coordinates at which the integration starts and ends, respectively.

The Random Forest algorithm is a popular ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. It is widely used for its ability to handle large datasets with higher dimensions and for its robustness against overfitting.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **data**: The dataset on which the Random Forest model will be trained. This should include both predictor variables (features) and target variables (labels), formatted as a DataFrame or a similar tabular structure. The dataset should be pre-processed before being passed to the function, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing or standardizing features if necessary.\n\n- **n_estimators** (optional): An integer specifying the number of trees in the forest. More trees generally improve the performance but also increase computational cost and memory usage. A typical default value is 100, but this can be adjusted based on dataset size and performance considerations.\n\n- **max_depth** (optional): The maximum depth of the tree. Limiting the depth can prevent overfitting, especially with smaller datasets. If not specified, nodes are expanded until all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain fewer than `min_samples_split` samples.\n\n- **random_state** (optional): Controls the randomness of the bootstrapping of the samples and the selection of features when looking for the best split at each node. Setting this parameter ensures reproducibility of results.\n\n#### Returns:\n\n- **model**: The trained Random Forest model object. This object can be used to make predictions on new data using the `predict` method, and it can be further evaluated using metrics such as accuracy for classification tasks or mean squared error for regression tasks.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nHere is a basic example of how this function might be used in practice:", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"n_estimators": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of trees in the forest."}, "max_depth": {"type": "integer", "description": "The maximum depth of the tree."}, "data": {"type": "any", "description": "The training data for the model."}}, "required": ["n_estimators", "max_depth", "data"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "Error during inference: name 'my_data' is not defined", "model_result_decoded": [], "possible_answer": [{"random_forest.train1": {"n_estimators": [100], "max_depth": [5], "data": ["my_data"]}}, {"random_forest.train2": {"n_estimators": [100], "max_depth": [5], "data": ["my_data"]}}, {"random_forest.train3": {"n_estimators": [100], "max_depth": [5], "data": ["my_data"]}}]}

These intent names are supplied as keyword arguments when the function is called. Each query is analyzed and then placed into the appropriate category that corresponds to the intent name provided. This ensures that every query is accurately stored in its respective category, which helps in maintaining organized and structured query data. For example, if you have queries that relate to booking flights and checking weather, you would pass these as keyword arguments with intents like `flight_booking` and `weather_check`, respectively.

This prediction is based on three key input parameters: the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, and the total area of the house. Each of these parameters plays a critical role in determining the estimated market value of the property.\n\n- **Number of Bedrooms**: This parameter reflects the total count of bedrooms within the house. It is an essential factor in the prediction model as it directly influences the house's capacity and appeal to potential buyers. Generally, a higher number of bedrooms can lead to a higher valuation.\n\n- **Number of Bathrooms**: This parameter indicates the total count of bathrooms available in the house. The presence of more bathrooms can significantly enhance the convenience and functionality of a residence, often contributing to an increased market price. \n\n- **Area**: This parameter is a measure of the house's total living space, often expressed in square feet or square meters. The area of a house is a fundamental component in pricing models since larger homes typically command higher prices. It includes all living spaces but may exclude any unfinished areas, depending on local real estate standards.\n\nThe function processes these inputs to output a predictive estimate of the house's price. It may utilize historical real estate data, current market trends, and possibly machine learning algorithms to generate an accurate price prediction. The output is a numerical value representing the predicted price, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding buying, selling, or investing in real estate within the targeted area.\n\nUsage Example:\nTo use this function, one might input the following values: \n- 3 bedrooms, \n- 2 bathrooms, \n- and a living area of 1,500 square feet. \nThe function would then calculate and return the predicted price based on these specifications.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- If the input values for any parameter are zero or negative, the function should be designed to handle these cases appropriately, potentially triggering a validation error or warning.\n- In scenarios where the area", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"bedrooms": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of bedrooms in the house."}, "bathrooms": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of bathrooms in the house."}, "area": {"type": "integer", "description": "The area of the house in square feet."}, "location": {"type": "string", "description": "The location of the house in the format of city name."}}, "required": ["bedrooms", "bathrooms", "area", "location"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"predict_house_price1": {"bedrooms": 3, "bathrooms": 2, "area": 1800}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"predict_house_price1": {"bedrooms": 3, "bathrooms": 2, "area": 1800}}], "possible_answer": [{"predict_house_price1": {"bedrooms": [3], "bathrooms": [2], "area": [1800], "location": ["San Francisco", "San Francisco, CA"]}}, {"predict_house_price2": {"bedrooms": [3], "bathrooms": [2], "area": [1800], "location": ["San Francisco", "San Francisco, CA"]}}, {"predict_house_price3": {"bedrooms": [3], "bathrooms": [2], "area": [1800], "location": ["San Francisco", "San Francisco, CA"]}}]}

These lists should contain query strings that are intended to be classified under the respective intent.

Allows for the bulk recording of query classifications in one function call.This function is designed to efficiently handle the task of recording classifications for a series of queries, which is particularly valuable in scenarios involving natural language processing or machine learning applications where intents need to be identified and stored. The function achieves this by taking in a series of queries and corresponding intent names, which are provided as keyword arguments. This setup enables users to specify intent names for each query in a clear and organized manner. \n\nBy allowing intent names to be passed as keyword arguments, the function provides flexibility and clarity in associating each query with its intended classification. This approach eliminates the need for multiple individual function calls for each query, thereby streamlining the process and enhancing code readability. Users can leverage this function to record multiple query classifications simultaneously, making it ideal for bulk processing applications where efficiency and speed are crucial.\n\nAn edge case to consider when using this function is ensuring that the intent names provided match the expected format or predefined categories used within the application or system. Mismatched or improperly formatted intent names could lead to incorrect classifications or errors. Therefore, it is important to validate the intent names prior to invoking the function.\n\nHere is an example usage scenario: if you have a set of queries such as \"What is the weather like today?\" and \"Set an alarm for 7 AM,\" you can call this function and pass the intent names 'weather_query' and 'set_alarm' as keyword arguments.

This calculation is fundamental in various statistical and probabilistic analyses.\n\nTo perform this calculation, the function typically requires input parameters that define the context or conditions under which the event's probability is being assessed. These parameters might include the total number of possible outcomes, the number of favorable outcomes for the event, and any additional constraints or variables that could influence the likelihood of the event. \n\nFor example, when calculating the probability of drawing an ace from a standard deck of cards, the function would take into account that there are 4 favorable outcomes (the four aces) out of a total of 52 possible outcomes (the total cards in the deck).

This calculation is based on three critical inputs: the initial invested amount, the expected annual return rate, and the number of years the investment will be held. \n\n1. **Invested Amount**: This is the principal sum of money that you are allocating to a particular stock investment. It is typically expressed as a monetary value, such as dollars, and serves as the starting point for the future value calculation.\n\n2. **Expected Annual Return**: This parameter represents the rate at which the investment is anticipated to grow annually. The rate is expressed as a percentage and reflects the average yearly gain that the investment is expected to achieve. It is crucial to note that this is an expected value, meaning it is based on predictions and historical data but is not guaranteed.\n\n3. **Number of Years**: This is the duration for which the investment will be held, measured in years. It determines the time period over which the compound growth will occur. The longer the duration, the greater the potential for the investment to increase in value, assuming a positive annual return rate.\n\nThe function utilizes the formula for compound interest to compute the future value of the investment.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.### Function Description\n\nThis function is designed to execute system-level commands specifically on Windows operating systems. It utilizes the `os.system()` method, which is a built-in function in Python's `os` module, to carry out the command execution. The primary purpose of this function is to allow users to interact with the underlying Windows operating system by sending commands that can be executed in the command shell.\n\n#### Functionality\n\n- **Command Execution**: The function can execute both individual commands and a series of commands. In the case of multiple commands, these can be chained together using the logical 'AND' operator `&&`. This means that each command will be executed sequentially, and the execution of subsequent commands will only occur if the previous command completes successfully without errors.\n  \n- **Windows OS Specific**: It is important to note that this function is tailored for use on Windows operating systems. While `os.system()` is available on other operating systems, the behavior and shell syntax may vary. Thus, this function is specifically optimized and intended for Windows environments.\n\n- **Return Value**: The `os.system()` function returns an exit status code of the command being executed. On Windows, a return value of `0` typically indicates that the command was executed successfully without errors. Any non-zero value usually signifies that an error occurred during the execution of the command.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n\n- **Command Syntax**: If there is a syntactical error in the command string, or if the command is not recognized by the Windows command shell, the execution will fail, and an error code will be returned. It is crucial for the user to ensure that the command string is correctly formatted and valid.\n\n- **Environment and Permissions**: The success of the command execution may depend on the environment in which the function is run. Certain commands might require administrative privileges. If such privileges are not granted, the command might fail, returning an error code.\n\n#### Example Usage\n\n- **Single Command Execution**: To run", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.This function is designed to execute system-level commands specifically on Windows operating systems. By leveraging the `os.system()` function from Python's `os` module, it allows the execution of a command string as if it were typed directly into the command prompt. This functionality is highly useful for automating command-line tasks or integrating system commands into Python scripts.\n\nThe function can handle not only individual commands but also multiple commands that are chained together using the '&&' operator. This chaining mechanism is particularly advantageous when you need to execute multiple commands in sequence and want subsequent commands to run only if the preceding ones succeed. For example, if you want to change the directory and then list its contents, you could pass a command string like `cd my_directory && dir` to the function. This ensures that the `dir` command will only execute if the `cd my_directory` command is successful.\n\nAn important detail to note is that because this function utilizes the `os.system()` method, it is synchronous, meaning the Python script will wait for the command to complete before moving on to execute the next line of code. Therefore, it is advisable to be cautious with commands that might take a long time to execute, as they will block further script execution until they are completed.\n\nWhen using this function, it is essential to ensure that the command string is properly formatted and valid within the Windows command-line environment. Incorrect commands or improper syntax could lead to errors or unintended behavior. Additionally, since this function executes commands at the system level, it requires appropriate user permissions to succeed, especially for commands that modify system settings or require elevated privileges.\n\nIn summary, this function serves as a versatile tool for executing Windows command-line instructions from within a Python script, providing flexibility to run single commands or multiple commands in a controlled sequence using '&&'.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, involves processing natural language input to classify the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. By analyzing the language features and patterns, this function helps in understanding the emotional tone conveyed in the input text.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **text (str):** The input string on which sentiment analysis will be performed. This parameter should contain the text data, such as a sentence, paragraph, or document, that you would like to analyze for sentiment. The text must be a valid string encoded in a format that supports natural language processing (e.g., UTF-8). \n\n#### Usage Example:\nTo use this function, you might pass a sentence like \"I love this product! It's amazing!\" to determine if the sentiment is positive. Another example could be analyzing a customer review or social media comment to understand the overall tone of user feedback.\n\n```python\n# Example of using the sentiment analysis function\ntext = \"I had a horrible experience with the service.\"\nsentiment = perform_sentiment_analysis(text)\nprint(sentiment)  # Expected output might classify this as 'negative'\n```\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- **Empty String:** If the input text is an empty string, the function should handle this gracefully, potentially returning a neutral sentiment or indicating that no sentiment can be detected due to lack of content.\n- **Ambiguous Language:** Text containing ambiguous or sarcastic language may pose challenges for sentiment analysis, potentially leading to less accurate classification.\n- **Non-Text Input:** The function should be robust against non-string input types, raising appropriate errors or warnings if the input does not conform to expected text data types.\n\nBy leveraging this function, you can gain insights into the emotional content of text data, which can be particularly useful for applications such as customer feedback analysis, brand monitoring, or social media", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"text": {"type": "string", "description": "The text on which to perform sentiment analysis."}, "language": {"type": "string", "description": "The language in which the text is written."}}, "required": ["text", "language"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"sentiment_analysis2": {"text": "I love the food here!

It is a utility that can be particularly useful for history enthusiasts, researchers, educators, and students who require accurate and detailed information about past events. The function operates by taking a specific historical event as input and returning the exact date associated with that event.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n- **event_name**: A string parameter representing the name or a brief description of the historical event whose date you wish to retrieve. This parameter should be as descriptive as possible to enable precise identification of the event, especially when dealing with events that might have common or similar names.\n\n#### Return Value\n\n- The function returns a string formatted as a date, typically in the \"YYYY-MM-DD\" format. This ensures that the information is clear and standardized, making it easy to integrate with other datasets or applications.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n\n- **Ambiguous Event Names**: If the event name provided is too vague or could refer to multiple events (e.g., \"World War\"), the function may return an error or prompt the user to provide additional information or context to narrow down the search.\n  \n- **Non-existent Events**: In cases where the event name does not match any known historical records, the function should handle such scenarios gracefully, potentially returning a message indicating that the date is not available or that the event could not be found.\n\n- **Date Format Variations**: While the function primarily returns the date in the \"YYYY-MM-DD\" format, users should be aware of any settings or options that might allow for different date formatting preferences.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\nHere's a simple example of how this function might be used in a practical context:\n\n```python\n# Example usage of the function\nevent_date = retrieve_event_date(\"Moon Landing\")\nprint(f\"The date of the Moon Landing is: {event_date}\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `retrieve_event", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"event": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the historical event."}, "location": {"type": "string", "description": "Location where the event took place.

By adjusting the lightness, users can either lighten or darken the blended color to achieve the desired brightness, catering to specific aesthetic or design needs.\n\n### Parameters:\n\n- `primary_color1`: The first primary color to be combined. This should be one of the primary colors such as red, blue, or yellow.\n- `primary_color2`: The second primary color to be combined. This should again be one of the primary colors that, when mixed with the first, results in a new color.\n- `lightness_adjustment`: A numerical value indicating the degree to which the resulting color's lightness should be altered. This can be a positive value to increase lightness or a negative value to decrease lightness.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n\n- If the same primary color is provided for both inputs, the resulting color will simply be that primary color.\n- The function assumes valid primary colors are provided; handling of invalid input colors is not specified within this description.\n\n### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose you want to mix red and blue to make purple, and you would like the resulting purple to be lighter. You would call the function with `primary_color1` as 'red', `primary_color2` as 'blue', and a positive `lightness_adjustment` value. \n\nThis function is particularly useful in applications related to digital art, painting, or design, where precise color control is required.

The analysis focuses on evaluating various aspects that are crucial for understanding the building's integrity, safety, and design efficiency.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **Id (string or integer):** This parameter serves as the unique identifier for the building. It allows the function to access specific data related to the building, ensuring that the analysis is accurate and relevant. The Id could be a string or an integer, depending on the database or system in use, and it must correspond to an existing record to avoid errors during the analysis process.\n\n- **floorNumbers (integer):** This parameter indicates the total number of floors within the building. It is crucial for assessing the building's vertical structure and helps in calculating aspects such as load distribution, structural stability, and emergency evacuation plans. The value must be a non-negative integer, as negative numbers or non-integers would not make physical sense in the context of a building's floors.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\nThe function leverages the Id to retrieve information about the building, such as its dimensions, materials used, load-bearing design, and architectural features, from a centralized database or repository. Using the provided number of floors, it can make calculations related to structural load distribution, potential stress points, and compliance with building codes and safety standards.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- If the Id does not match any existing building record, the function should handle this gracefully, possibly by returning a meaningful error message or an empty result indicating that the building cannot be found.\n\n- If the floorNumbers parameter is zero, this might indicate a non-standard structure, such as a pavilion or a single-floor design, which may require special handling in the analysis.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\n```python\n# Example of calling the AnalyzeBuildingStructure function\nresult = AnalyzeBuildingStructure(Id=12345, floorNumbers=10)\n```\n\nIn this example", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"building_id": {"type": "string", "description": "The unique identification number of the building."}, "floors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "integer"}, "description": "Floor numbers to be analyzed."}, "mode": {"type": "string", "description": "Mode of analysis, e.g. 'static' or 'dynamic'.

This ranking is determined based on the results and performance metrics of a particular season and the type of league being considered. The function aims to provide insights into where the team stands among its competitors by evaluating its achievements during the specified timeframe.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `season`: This parameter allows the user to specify the particular season for which they want to obtain the team rankings. This could be represented in various formats, such as a single year (e.g., 2023) or a range of years (e.g., 2022-2023) depending on how the sports league organizes its seasons. It is crucial for the user to input the correct season to ensure the accuracy of the ranking data retrieved.\n\n- `type`: The `type` parameter refers to the specific category or division within the league. Sports leagues often have multiple types such as regular season, playoffs, or different divisions/classes within the league. Selecting the appropriate type is essential for obtaining the correct and relevant ranking as it influences the context and scope of the standings.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\nSuppose a user wants to find out how their favorite basketball team ranked during the 2022 season in the regular season category. The user would call the function with `season` set as `2022` and `type` as `Regular Season`. The function would then process these inputs, access the historical data for the specified season and type, and return the team's ranking position among all competing teams.\n\n**Edge Cases and Considerations:**\n\n- It is important to ensure that the season and type inputs are valid and correspond to existing data within the league's records.

It must be a numerical value that can be expressed as a decimal or floating-point number. This ensures precision in currency conversion.\n\n2. **from_currency (str):** A string representing the three-letter ISO 4217 currency code of the currency from which the conversion is being made. Examples include 'USD' for United States Dollar, 'EUR' for Euro, and 'JPY' for Japanese Yen.\n\n3. **to_currency (str):** A string representing the three-letter ISO 4217 currency code of the target currency to which the conversion is desired. Similar to the 'from_currency', it must conform to ISO 4217 standards.\n\n4. **exchange_rate (float):** This parameter is the current or desired exchange rate between the 'from_currency' and the 'to_currency'. It is a multiplier used in the conversion process and should be obtained from a reliable financial data source.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- The function returns a float, which is the equivalent monetary value in the target currency after applying the conversion.
