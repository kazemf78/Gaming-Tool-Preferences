It requires the user to specify the restaurant from which they wish to order as well as the specific food items they intend to purchase, along with the corresponding quantities for each item. \n\n#### Parameters:\n- **Restaurant Selection**: The user must provide the name or unique identifier of the restaurant from which they want to order. This ensures that the function targets the correct establishment on the Uber Eats platform, thereby accessing the menu specific to that restaurant.\n  \n- **Items and Quantities**: The user should specify the exact menu items they wish to order. Alongside each item, the user must indicate the desired quantity. This involves creating a list or dictionary structure where each entry contains a menu item as the key and the quantity as the value, allowing for precise order customization.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nSuppose a user wants to order from the restaurant \"Joe's Burger Shack.\" They decide to order two cheeseburgers and one side of fries. The function call might look like this:\n\n```python\nplace_order(restaurant=\"Joe's Burger Shack\", items={\"Cheeseburger\": 2, \"Fries\": 1})\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The `restaurant` parameter is set to \"Joe's Burger Shack\".\n- The `items` parameter is a dictionary with keys representing menu items (\"Cheeseburger\" and \"Fries\") and values indicating the quantities (2 and 1, respectively).\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- **Invalid Restaurant Name/Identifier**: If the provided restaurant name or identifier does not match any current listings on Uber Eats, the function should handle this gracefully by notifying the user of the error and possibly suggesting alternative options.\n  \n- **Unavailable Items or Incorrect Quantities**: If a specified item is not available in the chosen restaurant's menu or if the quantity is not feasible (e.g.,", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["restaurant", "items", "quantities"], "properties": {"restaurant": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the restaurant from which to order food."}, "items": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of food item names selected for the order."}, "quantities": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "integer"}, "description": "A list of quantities for each food item, corresponding by index to the items array."}}}}]}, "model_result_raw": "I'm sorry, but McDonald's does not sell pizza.

The calculation uses fundamental principles of physics, specifically the equations of motion under constant acceleration due to gravity.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **initial_height** (float): This parameter represents the initial height from which the object is dropped, measured in meters. It is crucial that this value is a positive number, as a negative height does not physically make sense in this context.\n\n- **gravity** (float, optional): This parameter represents the gravitational acceleration, typically measured in meters per second squared (m/s\u00b2). The default value is 9.81 m/s\u00b2, which is the standard acceleration due to Earth's gravity at sea level. This parameter allows for adjustments if the calculation is needed for different planets or conditions where gravity may vary.\n\n#### Description:\n\nWhen an object is dropped from rest (i.e., the initial speed is zero), it accelerates downwards under the influence of gravity. The final speed can be determined using the kinematic equation:\n\n\\[ v_f = \\sqrt{2gh} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( v_f \\) is the final velocity (in m/s),\n- \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity, and\n- \\( h \\) is the height (in meters) from which the object is dropped.\n\nThe function assumes ideal conditions where air resistance is negligible, allowing the object to accelerate uniformly. This simplification makes the computation straightforward and applicable for theoretical scenarios or environments where air resistance can be ignored.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose you wish to calculate the final speed of an object dropped from a tower that is 50 meters high. Using the default gravitational acceleration on Earth, the call to this function would be:\n\n```python\nfinal_speed = calculate_final_speed(initial_height=50)\n```\n\nThis would return", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"initial_velocity": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial velocity of the object."}, "height": {"type": "integer", "description": "The height from which the object is dropped."}, "gravity": {"type": "float", "description": "The gravitational acceleration.

An isothermal process is one that occurs at a constant temperature, meaning that the temperature of the system does not change during the process. A reversible process, on the other hand, is an idealized process that occurs infinitely slowly and can be reversed without leaving any change in either the system or the surroundings.\n\nIn the context of thermodynamics, entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system. For an isothermal and reversible process, the change in entropy (\u0394S) can be determined using the definition of entropy in relation to heat transfer. Specifically, the change in entropy is calculated using the formula: \u0394S = Q/T, where \u0394S is the change in entropy, Q is the amount of heat absorbed or released by the system, and T is the absolute temperature at which the process occurs, maintained constant throughout the process.\n\nThis function requires that the user input the values of Q, the heat exchanged, and T, the constant temperature, to compute the resulting entropy change. It is crucial to ensure that the temperature is given in an absolute scale, such as Kelvin, to avoid errors in the calculation. Furthermore, if the direction of heat transfer is into the system, Q should be positive, while if it is out of the system, Q should be negative, in accordance with the sign convention typically used in thermodynamics.\n\nAn example of using this function could be calculating the entropy change when 500 J of heat is added to a system at a constant temperature of 300 K. By substituting these values into the formula, the change in entropy would be calculated as follows: \u0394S = 500 J / 300 K, resulting in \u0394S = 1.67 J/K.\n\nOverall, this function is valuable for understanding how energy transformations impact the entropy of a system under the specific conditions of an isothermal and reversible process, which are common in theoretical studies and", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"initial_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial temperature in Kelvin."}, "final_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The final temperature in Kelvin."}, "heat_capacity": {"type": "integer", "description": "The heat capacity in J/K."}, "isothermal": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether the process is isothermal.

This means that for every call to this function, you can dispatch only one discrete command or parameter value to the appliance, thereby preventing the simultaneous sending of multiple instructions.\n\nThe requirement to send only a single value at a time ensures clarity and precision in the communication process, reducing the risk of potential conflicts or errors that might arise from sending multiple commands concurrently. This approach can be particularly beneficial in scenarios where the appliance needs to process each command sequentially to function correctly.\n\nFor example, if you are using this function to adjust the temperature of a smart thermostat, you would call the function once to set a specific value, such as \"72 degrees.\" If you need to make another adjustment, such as changing the fan speed, this would require a separate call to the function with the new desired fan speed value.\n\nOverall, this function provides a straightforward and efficient mechanism for appliance control by adhering to the principle of one command per function call, ensuring that each command is processed independently and accurately.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["body"], "properties": {"body": {"type": "dict", "description": "A dictionary containing the parameters for the appliance command.", "properties": {"airConJobMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The current job mode of the air conditioner.", "enum": ["AIR_CLEAN", "COOL", "AIR_DRY"], "default": "COOL"}, "windStrength": {"type": "string", "description": "The strength of the air flow.", "enum": ["LOW", "HIGH", "MID"], "default": "MID"}, "monitoringEnabled": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether air quality sensor monitoring is enabled.", "default": false}, "airCleanOperationMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The operation mode for the air cleaning function.", "enum": ["START", "STOP"], "default": "STOP"}, "airConOperationMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The operation mode for the air conditioner, indicating if it is turned on or off.", "enum": ["POWER_ON", "POWER_OFF"], "default": "POWER_OFF"}, "powerSaveEnabled": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether power save mode is enabled to conserve energy.", "default": false}, "targetTemperature": {"type": "integer", "description": "The target temperature to set for the appliance, in degrees Celsius.", "default": 20}, "relativeHourToStop": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of hours from the current time when the appliance should stop.

This calculation is particularly useful in scenarios requiring precise measurements of angles, such as graphical representations of clocks or mathematical problems involving time and angles.\n\n### Parameters:\n- **hour (int)**: The hour value from the given time, typically ranging from 0 to 23. If the hour is represented in a 12-hour format, it should be adjusted accordingly to fit within the 0-11 range for the calculation.\n- **minute (int)**: The minute value from the given time, ranging from 0 to 59. This value determines the position of the minute hand on the clock face.\n\n### Function Details:\nThis function computes the angle in degrees. The clock is considered circular, with 360 degrees representing a full rotation. A key aspect of the calculation is that the angle is measured in a clockwise direction from the hour hand to the minute hand. The result provided is the acute angle between the two hands, meaning the function always returns the smaller of the two possible angles.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- **Exactly on the Hour**: If the minute is 0, the minute hand is at the 12 o'clock position, and the hour hand's position is determined solely by the hour value.\n- **Same Hour and Minute**: If both hands overlap, such as at 12:00, the calculated angle will be 0 degrees.\n- **Maximum Separation**: At times like 6:00, the hands are diametrically opposite to each other, resulting in an angle of 180 degrees.\n\n### Usage Example:\nTo calculate the angle at 3:15:\n1. The hour hand is at a quarter past three, contributing to its position at 3/12 * 360 + 15/60 * 30 = 97.5 degrees.\n2.

It serves as a tool for organizing and categorizing customer interactions based on predefined classification criteria or categories, enabling better handling and analysis of customer service data.\n\n#### Functionality\n- **Purpose**: The primary goal of this function is to ensure that each customer query is associated with an appropriate classification. This process is crucial for maintaining an organized database of customer interactions, facilitating efficient query handling, and enabling data-driven insights into customer service performance.\n\n- **Input**: The function typically takes specific parameters that include the details of the customer service query. This can include information such as the query ID, customer details, and the classification category, which may be predetermined by an automated system or a customer service agent.\n\n- **Process**: Upon receiving the necessary input parameters, the function records the classification in a centralized system. This might involve updating a database or a CRM system with the classification details, ensuring that the query is stored under the correct category.\n\n- **Output**: The function does not necessarily return a value but ensures that the classification is stored correctly. Success or failure in recording the classification might be logged or signaled through a status message or a boolean indicator.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n- **Invalid Classification**: If a query is attempted to be classified into a category that does not exist or is invalid, the function should handle this gracefully, possibly by returning an error message or logging the incident for further investigation.\n\n- **Duplicate Queries**: In cases where the same customer query is attempted to be classified multiple times, the function should check for duplicates to prevent redundant data entries.\n\n- **Data Integrity**: The function must ensure the integrity and accuracy of the classification data, avoiding situations where queries are misclassified due to incorrect input parameters.\n\n#### Usage Example\nConsider a scenario where a customer service department receives a query related to billing issues.

Allows for the bulk recording of query classifications in one function call.This function is designed to efficiently record classifications for multiple queries in a single operation, making it particularly useful for handling large datasets where each query is associated with a specific intent. The intent names, which determine the purpose or category of each query, are provided as keyword arguments. By utilizing keyword arguments, the function offers a flexible interface, allowing users to specify intent names dynamically in a convenient manner.\n\nEach keyword argument represents a unique query-intent pair, where the keyword is typically the query identifier or name, and the argument value is the corresponding intent name. This design enables the function to process and store multiple query classifications in one call, streamlining operations that would otherwise require repeated individual calls for each query-intent pair.\n\nAn edge case that users should be aware of involves handling scenarios where a query might not have a corresponding intent name provided. In such situations, the function might need to handle the absence of information gracefully, potentially by skipping the recording of that particular query or by assigning a default intent if applicable.\n\nHere is a basic usage example for clarity:\n\n```python\nrecord_query_classifications(query1='intent_name1', query2='intent_name2', query3='intent_name3')\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `record_query_classifications` is called with three queries, each linked to an intent. The arguments `query1`, `query2`, and `query3` are the query identifiers, and `'intent_name1'`, `'intent_name2'`, and `'intent_name3'` are the corresponding intent names.

This value is crucial as it sets the baseline for all future growth calculations. The annual growth rate is expressed as a percentage, signifying the expected increase in the value of the investment for each year it is held.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.The function is designed to execute system-level commands specifically on Windows operating systems. It utilizes the `os.system()` method, which is a part of the `os` module in Python, to carry out this task. The `os.system()` function is a straightforward way to run commands as if they were being executed directly in the command prompt of Windows. This can include a wide range of operations, from simple directory listings to more complex command scripts.\n\nA notable feature of this function is its ability to handle multiple commands at once. This is achieved by chaining commands together using the '&&' operator. In the context of command execution, the '&&' operator allows users to run several commands in sequence. The subsequent command will only execute if the preceding command is successful, meaning it returns a zero exit status. This feature is particularly useful for executing a series of dependent commands where the success of one command is required for the next to proceed.\n\nFor example, a user can execute a command string such as `\"dir && echo 'Listed directories'\"`. In this case, the `dir` command will list the contents of the current directory. If this operation is successful, it will proceed to execute the `echo 'Listed directories'` command, which outputs the text 'Listed directories' to the console. This chaining feature enhances the versatility of the function, enabling more complex command sequences to be executed in a controlled manner.\n\nWhen using this function, it is important to handle the commands carefully to avoid any unintended system changes or security vulnerabilities. Since `os.system()` executes commands in the system shell, it has the same level of access as the user running the script, which can lead to potentially destructive operations if not used cautiously.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

This calculation is essential for understanding the environmental impact of a vehicle's operation over the course of a year. The function takes into account three primary factors to determine these emissions: the distance traveled by the vehicle, the type of fuel that the vehicle uses, and the fuel efficiency of the vehicle.\n\n1. **Distance Traveled**: This parameter represents the total number of miles or kilometers that the vehicle covers in a year. It is a crucial factor because the more a vehicle is driven, the more fuel it consumes, and consequently, the more emissions it produces.\n\n2. **Fuel Type**: The type of fuel used by the vehicle plays a significant role in the calculation. Different fuels have varying carbon content and therefore produce different amounts of carbon dioxide when burned. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, and alternative fuels like natural gas or electricity. Each of these fuels has a specific carbon dioxide emission factor, which is used in the calculation to ensure accurate results.\n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency**: Also known as fuel economy, this parameter measures how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel to cover a distance. It is typically expressed in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). A vehicle with higher fuel efficiency will consume less fuel over the same distance compared to a less efficient vehicle, thereby producing fewer emissions.\n\nThe function combines these parameters in a formula to determine the total annual carbon dioxide emissions for the vehicle. It is important to input accurate values for each parameter to ensure the validity of the calculation. This information can be beneficial for vehicle owners seeking to reduce their carbon footprint by understanding the emissions associated with their driving habits and vehicle characteristics.\n\n**Example Usage**:\n- A user can input the following: a vehicle that travels 15,000 miles annually, runs on gasoline, and has a fuel efficiency of 25 MPG.

It takes into account the standard rankings of Poker hands, such as Royal Flush, Straight Flush, Four of a Kind, Full House, Flush, Straight, Three of a Kind, Two Pair, One Pair, and High Card. The function analyzes the cards held by each player, identifies the best possible hand each player can make, and then compares these hands against each other to decide which is the strongest according to the rules of Poker.\n\nWhen multiple players have hands of the same rank, the function further evaluates their hands by comparing the values of the individual cards that make up the hand. For example, if two players both have a flush, the player with the highest card in their flush wins. If necessary, the comparison continues to the second-highest card, third-highest, and so on, until a winner is determined or a tie is declared.\n\nThe function handles edge cases, such as ties between players, by considering detailed Poker rules, including kicker cards or splitting the pot when players have identical hands. It ensures that all players' hands are correctly interpreted according to Poker rules and that the winner is accurately determined. In the event of a tie where the pot must be split, the function will also account for this scenario, ensuring fair and accurate outcomes.\n\nThis function is crucial for automating the decision-making process in a Poker game, providing a reliable way to determine the winner quickly and efficiently without requiring manual intervention.
