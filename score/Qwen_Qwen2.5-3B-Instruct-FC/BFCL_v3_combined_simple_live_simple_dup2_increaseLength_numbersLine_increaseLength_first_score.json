The primary objective is to ensure that each query received is systematically assigned to its corresponding category, allowing for efficient management, analysis, and retrieval of information. The function plays a crucial role in maintaining an organized system of query classifications, which can be instrumental for further processing, reporting, and fulfilling banking operational requirements.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **query_id**: A unique identifier for each query that is to be recorded. This ensures that each query can be distinctly recognized and tracked.\n- **query_content**: The actual content or body of the query. This is the text or message that describes the banking-related issue or request.\n- **category**: A predefined list or system of categories under which the query will be classified. Categories might include loan inquiries, transaction disputes, account management, fraud alerts, etc.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- The function should handle scenarios where a query does not clearly fit into any defined category, potentially by assigning it to a default or miscellaneous category or flagging it for manual review.\n- It must also address queries that could belong to multiple categories by applying predefined rules for prioritization or categorization to ensure consistency.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nTo illustrate the function's application, consider a scenario where a customer submits a query about a potential credit card fraud. The function would:\n- Receive the unique query_id to track this particular correspondence.\n- Extract and analyze the query_content to determine the nature of the issue.\n- Classify this query under the 'Fraud Alerts' category based on the content analysis.\n\nBy recording the categories of banking-related queries, this function enhances the efficiency of customer service operations, supports data-driven insights, and contributes to improved service delivery in the banking sector.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["faq_describe_telephone_banking_start", "bank_hours_start", "faq_describe_accounts_start"], "properties": {"faq_describe_telephone_banking_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "An array of strings containing queries about starting or signing up for telephone banking services."}, "bank_hours_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "An array of strings containing queries regarding the working hours or locations of bank branches."}, "faq_describe_accounts_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "An array of strings containing queries about descriptions of different types of bank accounts."}}}}, {"name": "record2", "description": "Records the categories to which various banking-related queries are classified.

For numbers, it returns the negative value.This function is designed to reverse or invert various types of input data, returning a transformed output based on the input's data type. The function can handle strings, booleans, and numbers, each with a specific inversion operation:\n\n1. **String Reversal**: When the input is a string, the function processes the string by reversing the sequence of its characters. For example, if the input string is \"hello\", the function returns \"olleh\". This operation ensures that the order of the characters is completely flipped from the end to the beginning, resulting in a mirror image of the original string.\n\n2. **Boolean Negation**: If the input is a boolean value, the function performs a logical negation. This means that if the input is `True`, the function returns `False`, and if the input is `False`, it returns `True`. This process effectively inverts the truth value of the boolean input, providing the logical opposite.\n\n3. **Numeric Negation**: When the input is a number, the function calculates its negative value. For instance, if the input is a positive number like `25`, the function returns `-25`. Conversely, if the input is already negative, such as `-13`, the function will return `13`. This operation changes the sign of the number, making positive numbers negative and negative numbers positive.\n\n**Usage Examples**:\n\n- For a string input `reverse(\"world\")`, the output would be `\"dlrow\"`.\n- For a boolean input `reverse(True)`, the result would be `False`.\n- For a numeric input `reverse(42)`, the output would be `-42`.\n\nThis function allows for versatile handling of data types, performing appropriate inversion operations depending on whether the input is a string, boolean, or number.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["input_value"], "properties": {"input_value": {"type": "any", "description": "The value to be reversed.

This function acts as an interface to the underlying operating system, allowing for the execution of command-line instructions directly from within a Python script. \n\nWhen you use `os.system()`, it takes a single string argument which represents the command you wish to execute. This string should be formatted in the same way as if you were typing it directly into the Windows command prompt. The `os.system()` function then passes this command to the operating system's command processor and executes it.\n\nAlthough `os.system()` is straightforward to use, it's essential to note that it does not capture the output of the executed command; it simply runs the command as a sub-process. As such, any output from the command will be sent directly to the standard output (stdout), typically the console from which the script was run. Additionally, `os.system()` returns the exit status of the command run, which can be checked to determine if the command executed successfully (an exit code of zero) or if there was an error (a non-zero exit code).\n\nAn edge case to consider is the handling of special shell characters or spaces in your command. If your command includes such characters, you may need to ensure they are properly escaped or quoted to avoid unexpected behavior.

For example, you might want to perform file operations, launch applications, or run scripts from the command line.\n\nWhen using this function to execute multiple commands chained with '&&', each command must be separated by this operator within the string. The '&&' operator ensures that each command is executed sequentially, with the next command only running if the previous command finishes with a success (exit status 0). This is particularly useful for tasks that depend on the successful execution of previous commands.\n\nHere is a usage example: \n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Executes a single command\nos.system('echo Hello, World!')\n\n# Executes multiple commands chained with '&&'\nos.system('cd C:\\\\MyDirectory && dir && echo Done')\n```\n\nIn this example, first, a single command is executed, which simply outputs \"Hello, World!\" to the console. In the second example, three commands are chained together: changing the directory to \"C:\\MyDirectory\", listing the directory contents with \"dir\", and finally, printing \"Done\" if both previous commands execute successfully. Note that the chaining operation will halt at the first command that fails, preventing subsequent commands from executing. \n\nThis function is synchronous, meaning it will block further execution of your Python script until the command has finished running.

This functionality is pivotal when you require your Python script to interact directly with the operating system's command line interface. The `os.system()` call allows a Python script to execute a command as if it were typed directly into the Command Prompt.\n\nFor executing the command, you simply need to pass the desired system command as a string argument to the `os.system()` function. This can include a single command or multiple commands that are chained together using the '&&' operator. The '&&' operator ensures that commands are executed sequentially, where the subsequent command will only run if the previous one completes successfully (i.e., returns a zero exit status). This is particularly useful for executing a series of dependent commands where the successful execution of the first command is necessary for the execution of the next.\n\nFor example, to execute a single command, you might use:\n```python\nos.system('dir')\n```\nThis would invoke the `dir` command, listing the contents of the current directory in the Command Prompt.\n\nTo execute multiple commands, you could use:\n```python\nos.system('cd \\\\ && mkdir new_folder')\n```\nIn this example, the script first navigates to the root directory using `cd \\\\` and then creates a new folder named `new_folder` using `mkdir new_folder`. If the first command fails, the second command will not execute, thanks to the '&&' chaining.\n\nThis function is limited to the Windows operating system and relies on the capabilities and available commands of the Windows Command Prompt environment. It's important to note that while `os.system()` is a straightforward way to invoke system commands from within a Python script, it does not provide access to more advanced features such as capturing the output of the command.

The '&&' operator is a logical AND operator used in command-line interfaces to link multiple commands such that the subsequent command will only run if the preceding command executes successfully without errors. This can be particularly useful when you need to perform a series of dependent operations, ensuring that each step is completed successfully before moving on to the next.\n\nFor example, if you want to create a new directory and then navigate into it only if the directory creation was successful, you can chain these commands like so: `os.system(\"mkdir new_folder && cd new_folder\")`. In this case, the `mkdir new_folder` command will attempt to create a directory named 'new_folder'. If this command executes successfully, the `cd new_folder` command will then be executed, changing the current working directory to the newly created directory.\n\nIt's important to note that since this function uses `os.system()`, it depends on the underlying shell to process the commands, and the exact behavior may vary depending on the Windows environment configuration.

If a developer wants to fetch the unique identifier for the 'Payment Processing' service, they would call the function with 'Payment Processing' as the serviceType argument. The function will then return the corresponding unique identifier, which can be used in subsequent operations like logging, monitoring, or invoking specific service-related actions.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- If the serviceType provided does not match any existing service types within the system, the function should handle this gracefully, possibly by returning a null value or throwing an appropriate exception/error that can be caught and managed by the calling code.\n- It is important to ensure that the serviceType is not null or empty, as this would lead to undefined behavior or erroneous results.\n\nBy using this function, developers can streamline their process of managing and interfacing with various services, ensuring consistent and reliable access to the necessary service identifiers.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["service_id"], "properties": {"service_id": {"type": "integer", "description": "The unique identifier of the service.

The calculation is based on three critical parameters: the distance traveled by the vehicle over the course of a year, the type of fuel used by the vehicle, and the vehicle's fuel efficiency. \n\n1. **Distance Traveled:** This parameter represents the total distance that the vehicle covers in a year, typically measured in kilometers or miles. It is an essential factor because the amount of CO2 emissions is directly proportional to how far the vehicle travels. The greater the distance, the more emissions are expected, provided other factors remain constant.\n\n2. **Fuel Type:** This refers to the kind of fuel the vehicle uses, such as gasoline, diesel, or alternative fuels like ethanol or natural gas. Each fuel type has a specific carbon content, and the emissions calculation will vary depending on the carbon intensity associated with the combustion of that particular fuel. For instance, gasoline and diesel have different emission factors, affecting the total CO2 emissions calculated.\n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency:** This parameter indicates how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel to travel a given distance, typically stated in terms of liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km) or miles per gallon (mpg). Higher fuel efficiency means that the vehicle consumes less fuel for the same distance, resulting in lower CO2 emissions. Conversely, lower efficiency leads to higher emissions.\n\nThe function combines these parameters to estimate the total CO2 emissions for the year. It considers how the interplay between the distance traveled, the fuel type used, and the vehicle's fuel efficiency impacts the overall emissions output. For instance, even if a vehicle travels a substantial distance, if it uses a fuel with a low carbon content or has high fuel efficiency, the emissions might remain relatively low. Conversely, a vehicle with poor fuel efficiency using a high-carbon fuel type will likely produce higher emissions over the same distance.\n\nIn summary, this function provides a crucial environmental metric by allowing individuals, organizations,", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"distance": {"type": "integer", "description": "The distance travelled in miles."}, "fuel_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of fuel used by the vehicle."}, "fuel_efficiency": {"type": "float", "description": "The vehicle's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon."}, "efficiency_reduction": {"type": "integer", "description": "The percentage decrease in fuel efficiency per year (optional).

For instance, a common pop song might use a progression of four chords, while a more intricate piece could involve eight or more chords.\n\nThe function ensures that the chords generated are harmonically compatible with the specified key. Therefore, it selects chords that naturally occur within the given key's scale. For example, if the key is 'C Major', the chords generated might include C major, D minor, E minor, F major, G major, A minor, and B diminished.\n\nHere's an example of how the function might be used:\n\nExample:\n```python\nchord_progression = create_chord_progression(key='G Major', number_of_chords=4)\n```\n\nIn this example, the function will generate a chord progression in the key of G Major consisting of four chords. The output might include a sequence such as G major, C major, D major, and E minor. By ensuring the chords fit within the specified key, this function serves as a useful tool for musicians and composers who are looking to streamline the process of creating harmonically coherent chord progressions.\n\nEdge cases to consider when using this function include ensuring that the 'key' parameter is valid and recognized by the function, as well as confirming that the '", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"key": {"type": "string", "description": "The key for the chord progression."}, "chords": {"type": "integer", "description": "Number of chords in the progression."}, "progression_type": {"type": "string", "description": "The type of the chord progression.

This function is particularly useful for musicians, composers, and music theorists who need to understand harmonic structures or create chord progressions. \n\nWhen you provide the function with a key, it analyzes the notes that comprise that key's scale. The function then identifies the third chord, counting from the tonic, which is constructed using the major scale pattern. It\u2019s important to note that in Western music theory, a major chord is typically built using the first (root), third, and fifth notes of the scale. This function specifically targets the third position major chord within the sequence of triads that can be derived from the given key.\n\nFor instance, if the given key is C major, the function will calculate the third major chord in this key. In the C major scale (C, D, E, F, G, A, B), the third chord is E minor when considering the diatonic triads, but if the focus is solely on major chords, it will identify the next major chord after C major and G major, which does not exist in the basic major scale triads of C major.\n\nIn terms of usage, the function typically requires input specifying the desired key. This key can be represented in various forms, such as a string indicating the key signature (e.g., \"C major\" or \"G# major\"). The result is the name of the major chord that is third in the sequence of major chords possible in that key, or an indication that only two major chords are typically present within a diatonic major scale before repeating the cycle.\n\nThis function is highly relevant in music education and the development of software applications that analyze or generate music.

To achieve its purpose, the function requires three key parameters:\n\n1. **City**: This parameter specifies the geographical location in which the user is interested. It should be provided as a string representing the name of the city. The function utilizes this input to narrow down the search to sushi places within the specified city. It is important to ensure that the city name is spelled correctly and is recognized by the system's database for accurate results.\n\n2. **Review Rate**: This parameter indicates the threshold for customer satisfaction ratings that must be met or exceeded for a sushi place to be considered. It is typically represented as a numerical value, often on a scale from 1 to 5, with higher numbers indicating better reviews. This criterion ensures that only sushi places with a satisfactory level of customer feedback are included in the results. If no places meet the specified review rate, the function might return an empty list.\n\n3. **Top Number**: This parameter specifies the number of top-rated sushi places the user wants to retrieve. It should be provided as a positive integer. The function will sort the sushi places meeting the review rate criterion in descending order of their ratings and select the top entries up to the number specified by this parameter. If there are fewer places that qualify than the number requested, the function will return as many as are available.\n\n### Usage Example\n\nConsider a scenario where a user wishes to find the top 3 sushi places in \"San Francisco\" with a minimum review rate of 4.5.
