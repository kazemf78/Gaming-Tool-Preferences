The data retrieved typically includes elements such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and general weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).\n\nThis function is particularly useful for applications where users need to quickly find out the current weather situation in a specific area, such as travel apps, local news websites, or personal weather apps. Here are a few usage examples to demonstrate how the function might be invoked:\n\n1. To get the weather for Los Angeles, California, you would call the function with \"Los Angeles\" as the city and \"CA\" as the state.\n2. For New York City, New York, the city parameter would be \"New York City\", and the state parameter would be \"NY\".\n\nIt's crucial to ensure the city name is spelled correctly and the state abbreviation is accurate, as incorrect input could lead to errors or inaccurate weather data being retrieved.

Prime factors are the prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number. This operation is fundamental in number theory and has applications in areas such as cryptography, computer science, and mathematics.\n\n### Parameters\n\n- **number (int)**: The input parameter for this function is an integer whose prime factors are to be determined. It is important to note that this input should be a positive integer greater than 1, as prime factorization is defined only for such numbers. Inputs less than or equal to 1 do not have a meaningful set of prime factors, and the function may handle such cases by returning an empty list or raising an exception.\n\n### Return Value\n\n- **List of integers**: The function returns a list containing the prime factors of the input number. Each prime factor will be represented as an integer. The list will include multiple occurrences of a prime factor if it divides the number more than once. For example, for the number 18, which is 2 x 3 x 3, the function would return [2, 3, 3].\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- If the input number is a prime number itself, the function will return a list containing just the number since the only factors of a prime number are 1 and the number itself. \n- The function should handle large numbers efficiently, but be aware that processing very large integers may be computationally intensive.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nHere are some examples of how this function could be used:\n\n- `retrieve_prime_factors(28)` would return `[2, 2, 7]` because 28 equals 2 x 2 x 7.\n- `retrieve_prime_factors(13)` would return `[13]` since 13 is a prime number.\n- `retrieve_prime_factors(56)` would provide `[2, 2, 2,", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"number": {"type": "integer", "description": "Number for which prime factors need to be calculated"}, "formatted": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Return formatted string if true, array if false.

In cases where the input integer is less than 2, since there are no prime factors involved for such numbers, the function might return an empty result or indicate that the input does not have a valid prime factorization.

It takes an input that specifies the food item the customer desires to select. The critical aspect of this function is its adherence to a specific requirement: the name of the food item provided by the customer must be in uppercase letters. This ensures consistency and prevents errors that could arise from case sensitivity in processing food item names.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\n- **Input Requirement:** The function expects the food item name to be passed as a string. It is crucial that this string is entirely in uppercase letters. For example, if a customer wants to select \"pasta,\" the input should be \"PASTA\" instead of \"pasta\" or \"Pasta.\" This requirement is in place to maintain uniformity in how food items are recorded and processed within the system.\n\n- **Selection Process:** Upon receiving the request, the function checks the provided food name against a predefined list of available food items. It confirms that the requested food item exists in the list and then updates the current selection to reflect the customer's choice. The function will only successfully execute if the food name matches an item in the list exactly, taking into account the uppercase requirement.\n\n- **Error Handling:** If the food name is not supplied in uppercase or does not match any item in the available food list, the function will not proceed with changing the selection. Instead, it will typically return an error message or code indicating the nature of the issue, such as \"Invalid food item name\" or \"Food item not found.\" This helps guide users to correct the input and resubmit their requests appropriately.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose a customer wants to change their selection to a salad. The function call should look like this:\n\n```plaintext\nchangeFoodSelection(\"SALAD\")\n```\n\nIn this scenario, \"SALAD\" is the correct input because it adheres to the uppercase requirement.

The resonant frequency is a critical characteristic of the circuit and is defined as the frequency at which the circuit naturally oscillates due to the exchange of energy between the inductor and capacitor. This frequency is significant because, at resonance, the inductive and capacitive reactances cancel each other out, resulting in a purely resistive impedance.\n\nTo perform this calculation, the function requires two inputs: the inductance (L) of the inductor, typically measured in henrys (H), and the capacitance (C) of the capacitor, usually measured in farads (F). Utilizing these inputs, the function applies the universally recognized formula for determining resonant frequency, given by \\( f = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sqrt{LC}} \\), where \\( f \\) is the resonant frequency measured in hertz (Hz).\n\nSome important considerations include ensuring that both the inductance and capacitance values are positive, as negative or zero values would not be physically meaningful and would lead to mathematical errors or undefined behavior in the calculation. Additionally, if either L or C is extremely small, it could result in a very high resonant frequency, potentially exceeding the range of practical or safely operable frequencies for certain applications. Therefore, it is important to validate the input parameters to prevent unrealistic outputs.\n\nHere is a simple example of how the function can be used:\nSuppose you have an inductor with an inductance of 0.5 henrys and a capacitor with a capacitance of 0.02 farads.

This calculation is based on three critical parameters: the mass of the substance undergoing the phase change, the temperature at which the phase transition occurs, and the material's specific latent heat.\n\n- **Mass**: This parameter represents the quantity of the substance in question and is usually measured in kilograms (kg). It is crucial because the amount of energy required or released is directly proportional to the mass of the substance.\n\n- **Phase Transition Temperature**: This is the temperature at which the substance changes its phase, such as from solid to liquid or liquid to gas. It remains constant during the phase change process, as all the energy is used to alter the state rather than change the temperature. This parameter helps identify the specific phase transition taking place.\n\n- **Specific Latent Heat**: Specific latent heat is a property of the material and is defined as the amount of energy per unit mass required to change the phase of the substance without changing its temperature. It is typically measured in joules per kilogram (J/kg). There are two main types: latent heat of fusion (for solid-liquid transitions) and latent heat of vaporization (for liquid-gas transitions).\n\nBy accurately inputting these parameters into the function, the user can compute the total energy involved in the phase change. The formula utilized for this calculation is: \n\n\\[ \\text{Energy} = \\text{Mass} \\times \\text{Specific Latent Heat} \\]\n\nThis calculation does not account for energy changes due to temperature variation, as it assumes the temperature remains constant at the phase transition point.

It could be any global or local cuisine such as Italian, Chinese, Indian, Mexican, or more niche selections like vegan or fusion. The function uses this criterion to filter restaurants that specialize in or offer the specified type of cuisine.\n\n2. **Location**: This parameter determines the geographical area where the user wants to find the restaurant. It could be a city, a neighborhood, or even a specific address. The function evaluates restaurants within this specified area to ensure they are accessible to the user.\n\n3. **Condition**: The condition parameter adds an additional layer of specificity. This could involve a variety of considerations such as budget constraints (e.g., looking for affordable options), dietary restrictions (e.g., gluten-free, kosher), or ambiance preferences (e.g., family-friendly, romantic setting). The function applies this condition to further narrow down the list of potential restaurants that meet the given criteria.\n\n**Functionality:**\n\nThe function operates by first compiling a list of restaurants that satisfy the specified cuisine type and are located within the designated area. It then applies the additional condition to filter this list further. Once the filtering process is complete, the function evaluates the ratings of the remaining restaurants. Ratings could be sourced from review platforms, customer feedback systems, or an aggregated scoring system.\n\nThe primary goal of the function is to identify and return the restaurant with the highest rating among those that meet all specified conditions.

It prepares data for machine learning models, ensuring numerical values are scaled properly and categorical variables are appropriately transformed.This function is designed to preprocess input data through a two-step procedure that ensures the data is in a suitable format for machine learning models. The first step involves normalization of numerical values. Normalization is a technique used to adjust the scale of numerical data to a specific range, typically between 0 and 1, or to standardize it to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This is crucial for many algorithms that are sensitive to differences in scale, such as distance-based models like k-nearest neighbors or gradient descent optimization in neural networks, as it ensures that no single numerical feature dominates the model training simply due to differing scales.\n\nThe second step in the preprocessing process is the encoding of categorical variables. Categorical variables, which represent discrete categories rather than continuous values, must be transformed into a numerical format that can be interpreted by machine learning algorithms. This function handles this transformation through techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding. One-hot encoding creates binary columns for each category within a categorical feature, allowing the model to treat each category as a separate feature. Label encoding, on the other hand, converts each category into an integer value, although care must be taken to ensure that the model does not misinterpret these as ordinal data. \n\nBy applying normalization and encoding, the function ensures that the input data is scaled properly for numerical values and that categorical variables are accurately represented in numerical form.

The speed is calculated using the fundamental formula for speed, which is the distance traveled divided by the time taken.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **Distance (d):** This is a numerical value representing the total length covered by the object. The unit of measurement for distance can vary (e.g., meters, kilometers, miles), but it is important to ensure consistency with the unit used for time to obtain an accurate speed calculation.\n\n- **Time (t):** This is a numerical value that indicates the duration for which the object was in motion. The unit of measurement for time (e.g., seconds, hours) should be consistent with the unit of distance to ensure the resulting speed is meaningful.\n\n#### Returns:\n\nThe function returns a single numerical value representing the speed of the object. The unit of speed will depend on the units used for distance and time. For example, if distance is provided in meters and time in seconds, the speed will be calculated in meters per second (m/s).\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- If the time parameter is zero, the function must handle this case gracefully, as division by zero is undefined. Depending on the design, the function might return an error, a warning, or handle it in a predefined manner (such as returning infinity or zero).\n\n- If either the distance or the time is negative, the function should specify how such inputs are handled, whether by returning an error or by taking the absolute values.\n\n#### Example Usage:\n\n```python\n# Example 1: Basic usage\ndistance = 100  # meters\ntime = 10  # seconds\nspeed = calculate_speed(distance, time)\nprint(speed)  # Output: 10 m/s\n\n# Example 2: Handling zero time\ndistance = 50  # meters\ntime =", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"distance": {"type": "integer", "description": "The distance the object travelled in meters."}, "time": {"type": "integer", "description": "The time it took for the object to travel in seconds."}, "to_unit": {"type": "string", "description": "The unit in which the speed should be calculated, default is m/s."}}, "required": ["distance", "time"]}}, {"name": "calculate_speed2", "description": "Calculate the speed of an object based on the distance travelled and the time taken.This function computes the velocity of an object by utilizing the distance traversed and the duration of travel as input parameters.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"distance": {"type": "integer", "description": "The distance the object travelled in meters."}, "time": {"type": "integer", "description": "The time it took for the object to travel in seconds."}, "to_unit": {"type": "string", "description": "The unit in which the speed should be calculated, default is m/s."}}, "required": ["distance", "time"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"calculate_speed2": {"distance": 450, "time": 20}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"calculate_speed2": {"distance": 450, "time": 20}}], "possible_answer": [{"calculate_speed1": {"distance": [450], "time": [20], "to_unit": ["km/h"]}}, {"calculate_speed2": {"distance": [450], "time": [20], "to_unit": ["km/h"]}}, {"calculate_speed3": {"distance": [450], "time": [20], "to_unit": ["km/h"]}}]}

What options do you have?'\n- 'Are any banks open in Sri Lanka right now?'\n- 'Do you offer any special accounts for children or minors?'\n- 'Do you offer any special accounts for individuals looking to save for a home purchase or renovation?'"}]], "function": [{"name": "record1", "description": "Records the categories to which various banking-related queries are classified.The function is designed to systematically record and organize the categories into which various banking-related queries are classified. It plays a crucial role in managing and analyzing how customer inquiries and issues are sorted based on their nature and content. By doing so, it aids in streamlining the process of addressing customer needs and optimizing service efficiency.\n\n### Parameters:\n- **queries**: A list or collection of banking-related queries that need to be categorized. Each query typically involves customer concerns or requests related to banking services, such as account information, transaction issues, or loan inquiries.\n\n- **categories**: A predefined set of categories used to classify the queries. These categories might include topics like \"Account Management,\" \"Loans,\" \"Credit Cards,\" \"Fraud Detection,\" \"Transaction Disputes,\" and \"Online Banking,\" among others.\n\n### Functionality:\n- The function processes each query individually and assigns it to the most appropriate category from the list of predefined categories. This categorization process could involve keyword matching, natural language processing, or other heuristic methods to determine the best fit for each query.\n  \n- Once a query is categorized, it is recorded in a structured data format, such as a database or a log file, which allows for easy retrieval, analysis, and reporting. This enables the organization to track the frequency and types of queries received over time, providing insights into customer needs and service performance.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- Queries that do not fit neatly into any existing category may be flagged for further review or assigned to a general category.

By using this function, users can maintain an organized and easily accessible record of how each query is categorized, which can be crucial for analytics, reporting, and improving customer service processes.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **query_id**: A unique identifier for each customer service query. This parameter ensures that each query can be distinctly recognized in the database.\n  \n- **classification**: The category or type assigned to the query. This could include classifications such as 'Billing Issue,' 'Technical Support,' 'General Inquiry,' among others. Accurate classification is essential for effective query management and analysis.\n\n- **timestamp**: A record of the date and time when the classification was made. This helps in tracking the response and resolution times.\n\n#### Returns:\n\nThe function returns a confirmation message or a status code indicating whether the classification recording was successful. It may provide feedback such as 'Success,' 'Error: Invalid Query ID,' or 'Error: Undefined Classification' to inform users of the result of the operation.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose a customer service query with the ID `12345` needs to be classified as a 'Technical Support' issue. The function call might look like this:\n\n```python\nrecord_classification(query_id=12345, classification='Technical Support')\n```\n\nUpon successful execution, the query is logged under the specified classification, ensuring that subsequent analysis or follow-ups can be conducted efficiently. This also aids in trend analysis to pinpoint common customer issues.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Invalid Query ID**: If an unknown or invalid `query_id` is provided, the function should ideally handle this by returning an appropriate error message or status code.\n  \n- **Undefined Classification**: If the classification parameter does not match any pre-defined categories, the function should either prompt for correction or allocate the query to a default 'Uncategorized' group, depending on", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["money_movement_start", "get_transactions_start",

It involves several steps, beginning with the preprocessing of the dataset to ensure all features are in a suitable format for model training. This may include handling missing values, standardizing or normalizing data, and one-hot encoding categorical variables if necessary. Once the data is preprocessed, the function initializes a Random Forest Model, a robust ensemble learning method used for classification or regression tasks, which operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the mode of their classifications (for classification tasks) or mean prediction (for regression tasks) as the final result.\n\nThe training process involves the function dividing the data into training and testing subsets, often utilizing a technique such as cross-validation to enhance the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. Key parameters of the Random Forest Model, such as the number of trees in the forest, the maximum depth of the trees, and the criterion for splitting nodes, can be adjusted to optimize performance. The function then proceeds to fit the model to the training data, iteratively adjusting the model parameters to minimize the prediction error.\n\nAfter the model has been trained, the function evaluates its performance using a variety of metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for classification tasks, or mean squared error and R-squared for regression tasks. These metrics provide insight into how well the model has learned from the data and its potential effectiveness when applied to new, unseen datasets.\n\nUsage of the function typically involves specifying the dataset to be used, along with any relevant parameters for model configuration, allowing users to tailor the training process to their specific needs.

The number of bedrooms is an integer value representing how many bedrooms are available in the house. Similarly, the number of bathrooms is an integer indicating how many bathrooms the house has. The area is a numerical value representing the total floor space of the house, which is a critical determinant in the overall market value of a property.\n\nIt's important to note that the function assumes these inputs are accurate and relevant to the region where the property is located, as real estate prices can significantly differ based on geographic location.

Each parameter represents a different intent and accepts a list of query strings that should be classified under that intent.The function is designed to record classifications for a batch of queries, organizing them according to specified intents. The primary purpose of this function is to categorize each query string input into defined intent categories, which are represented by the parameters of the function. Each parameter corresponds to a distinct intent, and for every intent, the parameter takes a list as its argument. This list is comprised of query strings that are deemed suitable to be classified under that particular intent.\n\nWhen using this function, you will provide multiple parameters, each named after a specific intent you wish to classify the queries under. For example, you might have intents such as 'purchase', 'support', or 'information', and each of these intents will have its own associated parameter. The value you pass to each parameter should be a list containing the query strings that match or fall under the scope of that intent.\n\nAn important aspect of this function is its batch processing capability. This means it is well-suited for handling multiple queries in a single invocation, allowing for efficient processing and classification of large volumes of query data. The function does not require the queries to be related or in any specific order, as it will classify each based on the intent specified by the parameter name.\n\nTo illustrate how this function might be employed in practice, consider a scenario where you have a set of customer inquiries. Some of these inquiries are related to product purchases, others are support requests, and others still are general information queries. You would call this function with three parameters, perhaps named `purchase`, `support`, and `information`, each receiving a list of queries relevant to its intent.

It sequentially appends each string in the list, maintaining the order in which they appear, to form a single, uninterrupted string. It is important to note that this function does not add any delimiters or separators between the strings; they are joined together directly as they are. This means that if separation between original strings is desired, it must be explicitly included in the list elements themselves, such as spaces or any other desired characters. \n\nThe function handles edge cases gracefully. For instance, if the input list is empty, the function will return an empty string, as there are no elements to concatenate.

This calculation is performed by taking into account two primary inputs: the total dividend payout announced by the company for that quarter and the total number of outstanding shares at the time of the dividend distribution. \n\nThe total dividend payout represents the aggregate sum of money that the company has decided to distribute among its shareholders for that quarter. This is typically declared in the company's quarterly earnings report and reflects the company's profits and its commitment to returning value to its shareholders.\n\nOutstanding shares refer to the total number of shares that have been issued by the company and are currently held by shareholders, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders, as well as the shares available to the public. This number is critical as it determines how the total dividend payout is distributed on a per-share basis.\n\nThe function calculates the dividend per share (DPS) by dividing the total dividend payout by the number of outstanding shares. Mathematically, this is represented by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quarterly Dividend Per Share (DPS)} = \\frac{\\text{Total Dividend Payout}}{\\text{Outstanding Shares}} \\]\n\nThis calculation is crucial for investors and analysts to assess the dividend yield and understand the income generated from holding the company's stock. \n\nFor instance, if a company announces a total dividend payout of $10 million and has 5 million outstanding shares, the quarterly dividend per share would be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quarterly DPS} = \\frac{10,000,000}{5,000,000} = 2 \\]\n\nThus, each shareholder would receive $2 per share for that particular quarter. \n\nEdge cases to consider include situations where the number of outstanding shares changes due to stock splits, buybacks, or new share issues within the quarter, which may require adjustments to ensure accurate calculations.

It is typically provided as a decimal, where a 5% return would be input as 0.05. The yield rate is crucial as it directly influences the growth of the investment over time.\n\n2. **Investment Amount**: This is the initial sum of money that is invested in the mutual fund. It represents the principal amount upon which the returns will be calculated. The investment amount is essential for determining the scale of the potential returns, with larger investments leading to proportionately higher estimated returns, assuming the same yield rate and time period.\n\n3. **Time Period**: This parameter specifies the duration, usually in years, for which the investment is held in the mutual fund. The time period impacts the compounding effect, where longer durations typically result in greater overall returns due to the exponential growth facilitated by compounding interest.\n\nThe calculation process assumes the concept of compound interest, where the returns are reinvested and generate their own returns over time. This means that each year, the mutual fund's yield is applied not only to the original investment amount but also to the accumulated returns from previous years.\n\nFor example, if an investor puts $10,000 into a mutual fund with an annual yield of 7% for 5 years, the function will estimate the future value of this investment by applying the compound interest formula. It multiplies the original investment by the compound factor, which is calculated using the formula \\( (1 + \\text{yearly yield})^{\\text{time period}} \\).

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.This function is designed to execute system-level commands specifically on Windows operating systems by utilizing the `os.system()` method from Python's `os` module. The `os.system()` function is a straightforward way to interface with the underlying operating system to run shell commands from within a Python script. This function is capable of executing a single command or multiple commands that are chained together using the '&&' operator. The use of '&&' ensures that the commands are executed sequentially, meaning that each command is only executed if the preceding command is successful (i.e., it returns an exit status of zero).

A zero return value typically indicates that the command was executed successfully, while a non-zero value signifies an error. Additionally, since `os.system()` starts a new shell to execute the command, any environment variables or changes to the current directory will not affect the current Python script's environment after the function call completes.\n\nHere's a simple usage example:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Execute a single command\nos.system(\"echo Hello, World!\")\n\n# Execute multiple commands chained with '&&'\nos.system(\"cd C:\\\\ && dir\")\n```\n\nIn the first example, the command `echo Hello, World!` is executed, which simply outputs the string \"Hello, World!\" to the console. In the second example, two commands are executed in sequence: changing the current directory to the root of the C drive (`cd C:\\\\`) and then listing the directory contents using the `dir` command. Note that if the `cd` command were to fail for some reason, the `dir` command would not execute due to the use of '&&'.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.This function is designed to execute system-level commands on Windows operating systems by leveraging the `os.system()` function from the Python standard library. The primary purpose of this function is to allow Python scripts to interact with the system's command line interface, enabling the execution of various command-line utilities and scripts directly from Python code. \n\nThe function can handle the execution of either a single command or multiple commands. When executing multiple commands, they can be chained together using the '&&' operator. This chaining ensures that each command is executed sequentially, with the subsequent command only running if the previous one has been executed successfully. This behavior is particularly useful for scenarios where the outcome of a command is dependent on the successful execution of a preceding command.\n\nFor example, consider a scenario where you want to compile a program and then run it only if the compilation is successful. You can achieve this by chaining the commands as follows: `\"gcc myprogram.c -o myprogram && myprogram\"`. In this example, the program `myprogram` will only be executed if the compilation command `gcc myprogram.c -o myprogram` completes successfully without any errors.\n\nThe `os.system()` function returns the exit status of the command, which can be useful for error detection and handling in scripts. An exit status of `0` typically indicates success, while a non-zero value indicates that an error occurred during command execution. This behavior should be taken into account when designing scripts to ensure robust error handling.\n\nIt is important to note that this function is specific to Windows operating systems, as the behavior and availability of system-level commands can differ across operating systems.

It allows users to gain insights into future weather conditions to assist in planning activities. The function also includes the capability to offer optional precipitation details, which can be particularly useful for users needing information on potential rain, snow, or other forms of precipitation.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **Location (Required):** The function requires an input specifying the geographical location for which the weather forecast is needed. This could be provided in various formats such as city name, zip code, or geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude). Accurate input is essential for retrieving reliable data specific to the desired area.\n\n- **Duration (Required):** Another necessary input is the duration for which the forecast is required. This parameter defines the time span such as hourly, daily, or weekly forecasts. Users must specify the duration to ensure the forecast aligns with their planning needs.\n\n- **Precipitation Details (Optional):** Users have the choice to request additional details on precipitation. When this option is included, the function returns more granular data about expected precipitation, such as the likelihood of rain or snow, expected volume, and precipitation patterns over the selected duration. This feature is advantageous for individuals or organizations whose activities are heavily influenced by weather conditions, such as outdoor events or agricultural planning.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Invalid Location:** If the provided location is invalid or cannot be determined, the function may return an error or a default forecast for a generic region. Users should ensure the location input is correct and formatted appropriately.\n\n- **Duration Limitations:** Depending on the data source, certain durations may not be supported (e.g., forecasts beyond two weeks). The function should handle such cases gracefully, possibly with a warning or defaulting to the maximum available duration.\n\n- **Optional Details Absence:** If the user does not specify the optional precipitation details, the function will return a standard forecast without", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"location": {"type": "string", "description": "The city name that you want to get the weather for."}, "duration": {"type": "integer", "description": "Duration in hours for the detailed forecast."}, "include_precipitation": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether to include precipitation data in the forecast.

It operates by filtering a movie database or dataset according to three key parameters: the director, the genre, and members of the cast. \n\nWhen a user calls this function, they need to provide the name of a director, which could be a full name or part of a name, to help narrow down the selection to only those movies directed by the specified individual. Additionally, the user must specify at least one genre. This genre parameter allows the function to further filter the movie list to include only those that fall under the selected category, such as action, comedy, drama, etc. \n\nThe final parameter involves the cast. The user can input the name of one or more actors. The function will then cross-reference the provided names with the actors listed in the cast of each movie, ensuring that only movies featuring at least one of the specified actors are retrieved. \n\nAn important aspect to consider is how the function handles edge cases such as partial matches or misspellings. For instance, if a user enters a director's name that partially matches multiple directors in the database, the function might return movies from all matching directors, or it might require a more precise input. Similarly, if there's an error in the spelling of an actor's name, the function may not return the expected results unless it includes a mechanism for handling such discrepancies or performing fuzzy matching.\n\nA usage example for this function might involve calling it with the parameters: \"Christopher Nolan\" as the director, \"Science Fiction\" as the genre, and \"Leonardo DiCaprio\" as a cast member. The function would then search for movies directed by Christopher Nolan that are categorized under Science Fiction and feature Leonardo DiCaprio in the cast. The output would be a list of movies that meet all these criteria, providing users with a tailored selection based on their preferences. \n\nOverall, this function is a powerful tool for users interested in discovering movies that", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": [], "properties": {"directed_by": {"type": "string", "description": "Director of the movie.

Firstly, the function considers the coverage efficiency of the paint, which refers to how much area a single unit of paint can cover. This efficiency can vary based on the type and quality of paint, and it is crucial for determining the correct amount of paint required.\n\nAdditionally, the function accounts for exclusions within the specified area, such as windows, doors, or any other features that do not require painting. By excluding these areas from the calculation, the function ensures that the estimated amount of paint is both accurate and efficient, preventing unnecessary waste of paint.\n\n### Parameters:\n- **area**: The total surface area intended for painting, expressed in square units (e.g., square meters or square feet). This is the initial measurement before any exclusions are considered.\n- **coverage_efficiency**: The coverage capability of the paint, typically measured as the area covered per unit of paint (e.g., square feet per gallon or square meters per liter). This parameter is essential for calculating how much paint is needed for the area.\n- **exclusions**: A collection of areas within the total surface area that should be omitted from paint calculations, such as windows or doors. These are subtracted from the total area to yield the net area that will actually be painted.\n\n### Usage Example:\nSuppose you need to paint a wall that is 500 square feet in total, but there are two windows, each taking up 20 square feet. If the paint you are using covers 400 square feet per gallon, the function would calculate the paint requirement as follows:\n- Total area = 500 square feet\n- Total exclusions = 2 \u00d7 20 = 40 square feet (for the windows)\n- Net area to be painted = 500 - 40 = 460 square feet\n- Paint required = 460 / 400 = 1", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"area": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"width": {"type": "integer", "description": "The width of the area to be painted in feet."}, "height": {"type": "integer", "description": "The height of the area to be painted in feet."}}, "description": "The area to be painted."}, "paint_coverage": {"type": "integer", "description": "Coverage area per gallon of the paint in square feet.", "default": 350}, "exclusion": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"type": {"type": "string", "description": "The type of the exclusion e.g window, door etc."}, "area": {"type": "integer", "description": "The area of the exclusion in square feet."}}, "description": "Area not to be painted.

This information typically includes, but is not limited to, calorie content, macronutrient breakdown (such as proteins, carbohydrates, and fats), vitamins, minerals, and other pertinent dietary details.\n\nThe function requires two key inputs: the name or identifier of the food item and the identifier or name of the store. These inputs allow the function to pinpoint the exact item and source of data, ensuring that the nutritional information is accurate and relevant to the product as stocked by that particular store.\n\nAn important feature of this function is its ability to handle variations in food item availability between different stores. For instance, certain food items might have unique nutritional profiles based on brand or preparation method, and these variations are accounted for in the retrieved data. This function also considers edge cases where the requested food item might not be available at the specified store.
