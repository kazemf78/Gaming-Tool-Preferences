If the LLM does not provide an answer, it returns an empty string.The function is designed to process and interpret the response generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). Its primary role is to extract and return the answer contained within the LLM's output. This function takes the raw response from the LLM as its input. By analyzing the structure and content of the response, it identifies the portion that constitutes the answer. If the response includes a recognizable and valid answer, this portion is returned as the output of the function. However, in scenarios where the LLM's response does not include a discernible answer, or if the response is empty or malformed, the function is designed to handle such cases gracefully by returning an empty string. This ensures that the function's output is predictable and consistent, even when the LLM's response does not meet the expected criteria. This behavior is particularly useful for implementing robust systems that rely on LLMs, as it allows developers to handle cases where the LLM might fail to produce an answer without causing disruptions. \n\nFor example, when integrating this function into an application that queries an LLM for user-generated questions, if the LLM fails to generate a meaningful response, the application can continue operating smoothly by dealing with the absence of an answer as simply an empty string. This can be particularly important when handling large volumes of queries, where some instances may naturally result in non-answers.

Such processes are characterized by a constant temperature throughout and progress without any entropy production due to irreversibilities. The function relies on the fundamental thermodynamic relationship that defines entropy change in these specific conditions.\n\n#### Key Characteristics:\n\n1. **Isothermal Process:**\n   - The process occurs at a constant temperature. This implies that throughout the entire process, the temperature of the system does not change. This is in contrast to adiabatic processes where there is no heat exchange or processes where temperature varies.\n\n2. **Reversible Process:**\n   - The process is reversible, meaning it can be reversed by infinitesimally small changes in a property of the system, with no net change in entropy occurring in the surroundings. This idealized condition assumes that the process happens infinitely slowly so that the system remains in thermodynamic equilibrium at all times.\n\n3. **Entropy Change Calculation:**\n   - The entropy change (\\( \\Delta S \\)) for an isothermal, reversible process is calculated using the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\Delta S = \\frac{Q_{\\text{rev}}}{T}\n     \\]\n     where \\( Q_{\\text{rev}} \\) is the reversible heat exchanged and \\( T \\) is the absolute temperature at which the process occurs. It is important to note that \\( T \\) must be in Kelvin to maintain consistency with thermodynamic conventions.\n\n#### Parameter Explanation:\n\n- **\\( Q_{\\text{rev}} \\):**\n  - This parameter represents the amount of heat that is reversibly exchanged in the process. It is typically expressed in units of energy such as joules (J) or calories (cal).\n\n- **\\( T \\):**\n  - Represents the absolute temperature at which the process occurs. It should be provided in Kelvin (K)", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"initial_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial temperature in Kelvin."}, "final_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The final temperature in Kelvin."}, "heat_capacity": {"type": "integer", "description": "The heat capacity in J/K."}, "isothermal": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether the process is isothermal.

This calculation is useful in various applications, such as clock animations, time-related puzzles, or to simply understand the geometry of clock hands. \n\nTo perform this calculation, the function takes into consideration the specific positions of both the hour and minute hands at the given time. The position of the hour hand is determined not only by the hour but also by the minutes that have passed since the beginning of that hour, as the hour hand moves continuously. Specifically, the hour hand moves at a rate of 30 degrees per hour, and therefore, 0.5 degrees per minute. For example, at 3:15, the hour hand is not exactly at the 3 o'clock position but rather slightly ahead, specifically at 97.5 degrees (90 degrees for 3 hours plus an additional 7.5 degrees for 15 minutes).\n\nThe minute hand, on the other hand, moves at a consistent rate of 6 degrees per minute as it completes a full circle, or 360 degrees, every hour. Therefore, at 15 minutes past any hour, the minute hand is positioned at the 90-degree mark.\n\nOnce the positions of both hands are calculated in degrees from the 12 o'clock position, the function determines the angle between these two positions. It considers the smaller angle formed between the hands, as this is typically the angle of interest.

The `os.system()` function is primarily designed to send a command to the system's command interpreter, which in Windows is typically the Command Prompt, known as `cmd.exe`. Once invoked, the command string passed to `os.system()` will be executed as though it were typed directly into the command line interface.\n\nThe command to be executed must be provided as a string argument to this function. It's important to ensure that the command string is correctly formatted and that any necessary paths, parameters, or options required for the command are included.

This return code can be used for basic error handling.\n\nAn edge case to consider is that `os.system()` cannot handle multi-line commands directly.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.This function is designed to execute system-level commands by utilizing the `os.system()` method specifically on Windows operating systems. The `os.system()` function is a part of the `os` module in Python, which provides a portable way of using operating system-dependent functionality. When using this function, users can execute not only singular commands but also multiple commands that are chained together using the '&&' operator. This chaining allows for the sequential execution of commands, where each subsequent command will only run if the previous one succeeds without errors. \n\nFor instance, executing `os.system('command1 && command2')` will attempt to run `command1` first. If `command1` executes successfully, then `command2` will be executed next. In the context of Windows operating systems, this can be particularly useful for executing a series of administrative or maintenance tasks that need to be completed in a specific order, such as updating software packages or configuring system settings. \n\nWhen using this function, it's important to note that `os.system()` runs the command in a subshell. This means it can handle environment variables and command path resolutions typical to the Windows shell environment. However, users should be cautious with commands that require user interaction, as `os.system()` does not provide a means to capture or respond to user prompts. Additionally, error handling should be considered, as the function will return the exit status of the command executed, which can be used to determine success or failure. \n\nHere is an example of how one might use this function:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Execute a single command\nos.system('dir')\n\n# Execute multiple commands chained with '&&'\nos.system('echo Starting process && dir && echo Process complete')\n```\n\nIn this example, the first command lists the contents of the current directory, while the second example demonstrates chaining commands where it first prints a message, lists directory contents, and then prints another message upon successful completion of the previous commands.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

By specifying the desired services, users can ensure that the retrieved professionals are capable of meeting their particular requirements.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\nSuppose a user is looking for professional photographers with an average rating of at least 4.5, located in the province of Ontario, who offer wedding photography services. The function call might look like this:\n\n```python\nretrieveProfessionalWorkers(average_rating=4.5, province=\"Ontario\", services_offered=[\"wedding photography\"])\n```\n\nThis call would return a collection of professional photographers who meet all these criteria, allowing the user to choose from a curated list of suitable candidates.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n- If no professionals meet all the specified criteria, the function will return an empty collection. This outcome indicates that no suitable matches were found based on the provided parameters.\n\n- The function should handle cases where one or more criteria are unspecified by broadening the search to include all possibilities for those unspecified criteria. For instance, if the province is not specified, the search will include professionals from all provinces.\n\nThe `retrieveProfessionalWorkers", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["province_id"], "properties": {"avg_rating": {"type": "float", "description": "The average rating of the service provider's review score, ranging from 1.0 (very bad) to 5.0 (excellent) in increments of 0.5.", "default": 3.0}, "province_id": {"type": "integer", "description": "The unique identifier for a province.

This calculation is based on three critical input parameters: the distance traveled by the vehicle in a year, the type of fuel used by the vehicle, and the vehicle's fuel efficiency. \n\nThe first parameter, distance traveled, refers to the total number of miles or kilometers the vehicle covers over the course of a year. This data is essential as it directly impacts the total fuel consumption of the vehicle, which in turn influences the amount of CO2 emissions.\n\nThe second parameter is the fuel type, which specifies the kind of fuel the vehicle uses, such as gasoline, diesel, or alternative fuels like natural gas or electricity. Each fuel type has a distinct carbon emission factor, which determines how much CO2 is released per unit of fuel consumed. For instance, gasoline and diesel have different carbon contents and thus different emission impacts when burned.\n\nThe third parameter, fuel efficiency, indicates how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel, typically expressed as miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). Higher fuel efficiency implies that the vehicle can travel farther on a smaller amount of fuel, thereby reducing the overall CO2 emissions.\n\nBy combining these three parameters, the function calculates the vehicle's total annual CO2 emissions, providing valuable insights for individuals or organizations aiming to monitor and reduce their carbon footprint. The function assumes standard emissions factors and consistent fuel consumption across the distance traveled. It is important to use accurate measurements for each parameter to ensure the reliability of the emission estimates.\n\nUsage Example:\nAssume a vehicle travels 15,000 miles in a year, uses gasoline as fuel, and has a fuel efficiency of 25 miles per gallon.

The primary purpose of this function is to streamline the ticket purchasing process by allowing users to specify both the artist they wish to see and the city in which they would like to attend the concert.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **artist**: This parameter represents the name of the artist or band for whom the concert tickets are being booked. It is crucial for this parameter to be accurately specified, as it directly influences the search results for available concerts and subsequently the ticket booking options.\n\n2. **city**: This parameter denotes the city where the user intends to attend the concert. It plays a significant role in filtering the available concert events to match those occurring within the specified geographical location, ensuring that users receive options relevant to their chosen destination.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nTo utilize this function effectively, a user must provide both the artist and city parameters. For instance, if a user wishes to book tickets to see \"The Beatles\" in \"New York\", they would call the function with those specific arguments: `bookConcertTickets(\"The Beatles\", \"New York\")`.\n\n#### Edge Cases and Considerations:\n\n- **Artist Availability**: The function assumes that the specified artist has scheduled performances in the selected city.

Mis-spellings or ambiguous city names may lead to incorrect results or no results at all. Users should ensure correct spelling and use of city names to optimize the function's effectiveness.\n\n- **Concert Listings Update**: This function's efficacy depends on up-to-date concert listings.
