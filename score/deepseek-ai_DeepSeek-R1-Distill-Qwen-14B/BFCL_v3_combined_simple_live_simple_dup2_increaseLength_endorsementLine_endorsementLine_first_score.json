To achieve this, the function takes into account two key parameters: the acceleration of the object and the distance it has traveled. The calculation is based on the fundamental kinematic equation that relates velocity, acceleration, and distance. Specifically, it applies the formula:\n\n\\[ v_f = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot a \\cdot d} \\]\n\nHere, \\( v_f \\) represents the final velocity, \\( a \\) stands for the acceleration, and \\( d \\) denotes the distance traveled by the object. This formula is derived from the kinematic equation that assumes constant acceleration and an initial velocity of zero, which simplifies the process of determining the final velocity after traveling a certain distance.\n\n### Parameters:\n- **acceleration (a)**: This is the constant rate at which the velocity of the object is increasing. It is typically measured in meters per second squared (m/s\u00b2). The function assumes that this acceleration does not change over the distance traveled.\n  \n- **distance (d)**: This parameter represents the total distance that the object has moved, measured in meters. It is the displacement from the initial position to the final position while the object is subject to the specified acceleration.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- If the acceleration is zero, the final velocity will remain zero regardless of the distance traveled, since there is no change in velocity.\n- If the distance is zero, even with a non-zero acceleration, the final velocity will also be zero, as there is no movement to impart any change in velocity.\n- Negative values for acceleration or distance are not physically meaningful in this context and may lead to unexpected results or errors in calculation.\n\n### Example Usage:\nSuppose you want to calculate the final velocity of a car that accelerates at 3 m/s\u00b2 over a distance of 100 meters, starting from rest.

Its primary role is to extract and return the answer contained within the LLM's output. This function takes the raw response from the LLM as its input. By analyzing the structure and content of the response, it identifies the portion that constitutes the answer. If the response includes a recognizable and valid answer, this portion is returned as the output of the function. However, in scenarios where the LLM's response does not include a discernible answer, or if the response is empty or malformed, the function is designed to handle such cases gracefully by returning an empty string. This ensures that the function's output is predictable and consistent, even when the LLM's response does not meet the expected criteria. This behavior is particularly useful for implementing robust systems that rely on LLMs, as it allows developers to handle cases where the LLM might fail to produce an answer without causing disruptions. \n\nFor example, when integrating this function into an application that queries an LLM for user-generated questions, if the LLM fails to generate a meaningful response, the application can continue operating smoothly by dealing with the absence of an answer as simply an empty string.

Returns an empty string if the LLM output is 'answer not found'.The function is designed to serve a specific purpose: it processes the output generated by a Language Learning Model (LLM) and evaluates whether the response is considered valid according to predetermined criteria. The function's primary task is to parse the answer produced by the LLM, which involves examining the output text to determine its correctness and applicability for the intended purpose.\n\nIn executing its duty, the function scrutinizes the output for certain key phrases or indicators of validity. A crucial aspect of its operation is the identification of the phrase 'answer not found' within the LLM's response. This specific phrase acts as a signal that the LLM was unable to generate a suitable or relevant answer to the query posed to it. When the function detects this exact phrase within the LLM's output, it recognizes that the response is invalid or lacking the necessary content.\n\nAs a result of this detection, the function is programmed to take a specific action: it returns an empty string. This return value serves as a clear indication to the calling process or system that the LLM did not provide a valid answer, and hence, no actionable or useful information is available in the output.\n\nTo illustrate how this function might be utilized, consider a scenario where an application relies on an LLM to provide answers to user inquiries. Upon receiving a response from the LLM, the application would call this function to parse and validate the output. If the response contained useful information, the function would allow the application to proceed with processing. However, if the response was identified as 'answer not found', the function would return an empty string, signaling to the application to handle the lack of a valid answer appropriately, perhaps by prompting the user to rephrase the question or taking alternate actions.\n\nIn summary, this function plays a vital role in ensuring that only valid and meaningful responses from a Language Learning Model are processed further, while efficiently handling cases where the LLM fails to provide an answer.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["answer"], "properties": {"answer": {"type": "string", "description": "The text response from the LLM in plain text.

Such processes are characterized by a constant temperature throughout and progress without any entropy production due to irreversibilities. The function relies on the fundamental thermodynamic relationship that defines entropy change in these specific conditions.\n\n#### Key Characteristics:\n\n1. **Isothermal Process:**\n   - The process occurs at a constant temperature. This implies that throughout the entire process, the temperature of the system does not change. This is in contrast to adiabatic processes where there is no heat exchange or processes where temperature varies.\n\n2. **Reversible Process:**\n   - The process is reversible, meaning it can be reversed by infinitesimally small changes in a property of the system, with no net change in entropy occurring in the surroundings. This idealized condition assumes that the process happens infinitely slowly so that the system remains in thermodynamic equilibrium at all times.\n\n3. **Entropy Change Calculation:**\n   - The entropy change (\\( \\Delta S \\)) for an isothermal, reversible process is calculated using the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\Delta S = \\frac{Q_{\\text{rev}}}{T}\n     \\]\n     where \\( Q_{\\text{rev}} \\) is the reversible heat exchanged and \\( T \\) is the absolute temperature at which the process occurs. It is important to note that \\( T \\) must be in Kelvin to maintain consistency with thermodynamic conventions.\n\n#### Parameter Explanation:\n\n- **\\( Q_{\\text{rev}} \\):**\n  - This parameter represents the amount of heat that is reversibly exchanged in the process. It is typically expressed in units of energy such as joules (J) or calories (cal).\n\n- **\\( T \\):**\n  - Represents the absolute temperature at which the process occurs. It should be provided in Kelvin (K)", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"initial_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial temperature in Kelvin."}, "final_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The final temperature in Kelvin."}, "heat_capacity": {"type": "integer", "description": "The heat capacity in J/K."}, "isothermal": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether the process is isothermal.

The Hardy-Weinberg Principle provides a framework for understanding genetic variation within a population that is not subject to evolutionary forces. It is an essential concept in population genetics, assuming that allele frequencies in a large population remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of other evolutionary influences.\n\nTo compute the frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype, the function uses the allele frequency of the dominant allele. Let \\( p \\) represent the frequency of the dominant allele. According to the Hardy-Weinberg Principle, the expected frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype, denoted as \\( p^2 \\), can be derived from the equation \\( p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1 \\), where \\( q \\) is the frequency of the recessive allele and \\( 2pq \\) represents the frequency of the heterozygous genotype.\n\nHere are some additional details about the parameters and the calculation process:\n\n- **Parameters**: The function typically requires the allele frequency of the dominant allele, denoted \\( p \\), as input. This frequency \\( p \\) should be a value between 0 and 1, inclusive. If \\( p \\) is not within this range, the assumptions of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium are violated, and results may not be accurate.\n\n- **Calculation**: The calculation involves squaring the allele frequency \\( p \\) to find \\( p^2 \\), which represents the proportion of the population that is homozygous for the dominant allele.\n\n- **Edge Cases**: In scenarios where \\( p = 1 \\), indicating that the dominant allele is the only allele present in the population, the frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype will be 1, and no other genotypes will be present.

Returns a list of times in seconds, each representing the occurrence of a significant beat within the audio file.This function is designed to perform an in-depth analysis of an audio file, with the primary objective of detecting beats throughout the duration of the audio. The detection process involves scanning the audio file to identify moments that can be defined as beats. Once these beats are identified, the function further processes them by applying filters based on two main criteria: confidence levels and timing.\n\nThe confidence level filter is used to ensure that only beats with a high degree of certainty are considered significant. This involves assessing the likelihood that a detected beat is accurately representing a genuine beat in the audio, thereby minimizing the inclusion of false positives or erroneous detections.\n\nThe timing filter is applied to organize and select beats based on their temporal occurrence within the audio file. By doing so, it ensures that the results are temporally coherent and meaningful in the context of the audio's rhythm and pace. This step is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the beat detection process, allowing for a more precise and relevant analysis.\n\nUpon completing these filtering stages, the function compiles and returns a list composed of timestamps. Each timestamp, expressed in seconds, corresponds to a moment in the audio where a significant beat was detected. Therefore, the output list provides a chronological sequence of these significant beats, offering valuable insights into the rhythmic structure of the audio file.\n\nFor example, when analyzing a song, this function might return a list such as [0.5, 1.2, 2.7, 3.9], indicating that significant beats occur at 0.5 seconds, 1.2 seconds, 2.7 seconds, and 3.9 seconds into the song.

The calculation of distance is crucial for various applications in astronomy and space exploration, including navigation, observation, and research.\n\nTo achieve this, the function might take as inputs the coordinates of the two celestial bodies. For example, in a Cartesian coordinate system, these could be expressed as (x1, y1, z1) for the first body and (x2, y2, z2) for the second body. The distance is then calculated using the Euclidean distance formula, which is derived from the Pythagorean theorem and is represented as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 + (z2 - z1)^2} \\]\n\nIn cases where the coordinates are given in a spherical system, additional transformations might be needed to convert these coordinates into Cartesian form before applying the distance formula.\n\nThis function takes care not only of calculating simple linear distances but also considers factors like the vast scales involved, ensuring that the results are accurate enough for practical use in scientific contexts.

The Random Forest algorithm is an ensemble learning method primarily used for classification and regression tasks. It builds multiple decision trees during training and outputs either the mode of classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. The function ensures that the Random Forest model is trained effectively on the input data, thereby leveraging its ability to handle large datasets with higher dimensionality and providing robustness against overfitting, particularly when the number of trees is sufficiently large.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n- **data**: This parameter represents the dataset on which the Random Forest model will be trained. It typically includes both the features and the labels or target variables. The data should be preprocessed, meaning missing values should be handled, and categorical variables should be encoded prior to training. The structure of the data must be compatible with the chosen Random Forest implementation, often requiring it to be in the form of a Pandas DataFrame or a NumPy array.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n\n1. **Imbalanced Datasets**: When the dataset is significantly imbalanced, the Random Forest model might be biased towards the majority class. Implementing techniques such as class weighting or resampling might be necessary to address this issue.\n\n2. **High Dimensionality**: In cases where the dataset has a large number of features, it might be beneficial to employ dimensionality reduction techniques prior to training to enhance model performance and reduce computation time.\n\n3. **Memory Limitations**: Training a Random Forest with a very large number of trees or on a very large dataset can lead to excessive memory usage. It's important to consider system limitations and adjust the model's parameters accordingly.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n\ndef train_random_forest(data, target_column):\n    \"\"\"\n    Train a Random Forest model using the provided dataset.\n\n    Parameters", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"n_estimators": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of trees in the forest."}, "max_depth": {"type": "integer", "description": "The maximum depth of the tree."}, "data": {"type": "any", "description": "The training data for the model."}}, "required": ["n_estimators", "max_depth", "data"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\n[ random_forest.train1(n_estimators=100, max_depth=5, data=my_data) ]", "possible_answer": [{"random_forest.train1": {"n_estimators": [100], "max_depth": [5], "data": ["my_data"]}}, {"random_forest.train2": {"n_estimators": [100], "max_depth": [5], "data": ["my_data"]}}, {"random_forest.train3": {"n_estimators": [100], "max_depth": [5], "data": ["my_data"]}}]}

This function specifically focuses on determining the probability of rolling one particular number\u2014such as a 3\u2014multiple times in succession. \n\nTo perform this calculation, the function requires two inputs. The first input specifies the desired number to roll repeatedly (e.g., rolling a 5).

The calculation involves raising the probability of rolling the desired number (1/6) to the power equal to the consecutive rolls required. For example, to find the probability of rolling a 5 three times in a row, you would calculate (1/6)^3, which equals 1/216.\n\nEdge cases include considering scenarios like rolling a number zero times, which would technically have a probability of 1, as no rolls are needed to achieve the outcome.

The coefficient of determination is a statistical measure that provides insight into how well the independent variables explain the variability of the dependent variable in the model. It essentially quantifies the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.\n\n### Description\n\nThe R-squared value ranges from 0 to 1, where:\n- An R-squared of 0 indicates that the independent variables do not explain any of the variation in the dependent variable.\n- An R-squared of 1 indicates that the independent variables explain all the variation in the dependent variable.\n- Values between 0 and 1 represent the degree to which the model explains the variance in the dependent variable.\n\n### Usage\n\nThe coefficient of determination is widely used to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of a regression model. A higher R-squared value typically indicates a better fit, meaning the model's predictions are closer to the actual data points. However, it is important to note that a high R-squared value does not necessarily imply that the model is the best model or that it will generalize well to unseen data.\n\n### Parameters\n\nTo calculate the coefficient of determination, the function typically requires the following inputs:\n- **y_true**: An array or list representing the actual observed values of the dependent variable.\n- **y_pred**: An array or list representing the predicted values obtained from the regression model for the dependent variable.\n\n### Example\n\nConsider a simple linear regression model predicting house prices based on square footage. When using the function to compute R-squared, the **y_true** parameter would contain the actual house prices, and the **y_pred** parameter would contain the predicted house prices output by the model.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- If there is no variation in the dependent variable (i.e., all actual values are the same), the R-squared value may not be well-defined, as the total", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"dataset_path": {"type": "string", "description": "Path to the CSV dataset file."}, "independent_variables": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "The independent variables to use in the regression model."}, "dependent_variable": {"type": "string", "description": "The dependent variable to predict in the regression model."}}, "required": ["dataset_path", "independent_variables", "dependent_variable"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\n[linear_regression.get_r_squared1(dataset_path='C:/data/cars.csv', independent_variables=['engine_size', 'fuel_economy'], dependent_variable='car_price)]", "possible_answer": [{"linear_regression.get_r_squared1": {"dataset_path": ["C:/data/cars.csv"], "independent_variables": [["engine_size", "fuel_economy"]], "dependent_variable": ["car_price"]}}, {"linear_regression.get_r_squared2": {"dataset_path": ["C:/data/cars.csv"], "independent_variables": [["engine_size", "fuel_economy"]], "dependent_variable": ["car_price"]}}, {"linear_regression.get_r_squared3": {"dataset_path": ["C:/data/cars.csv"], "independent_variables": [["engine_size", "fuel_economy"]], "dependent_variable": ["car_price"]}}]}

It takes into account the yearly yield of the fund, the amount of money invested, and the duration over which the investment is held. By synthesizing these elements, the function provides an estimate of the potential financial return.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **Yearly Yield**: This parameter represents the annual percentage rate at which the mutual fund is expected to grow. It is typically expressed as a percentage. The yearly yield should reflect realistic market conditions and mutual fund performance metrics. For example, a yearly yield of 5% would be input as 0.05.\n\n2. **Investment Amount**: This parameter details the total sum of money that is initially invested into the mutual fund. It is crucial for determining the base from which returns are calculated. The investment amount should be a positive numerical value representing the amount in currency units (e.g., dollars, euros).\n\n3. **Time Period**: This parameter indicates the duration for which the investment is held. The time period is usually expressed in years and should be a positive integer or a decimal value. For instance, an investment period of 5 years could be entered as 5 or 5.0.\n\n#### Calculation Process:\n\nThe function employs the formula for calculating compound interest, adjusted for mutual funds. The estimated return is derived by applying the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Estimated Return} = \\text{Investment Amount} \\times (1 + \\text{Yearly Yield})^{\\text{Time Period}} \\]\n\nThis calculation assumes that the yield is compounded annually, meaning the investment grows at the yearly yield rate each year over the specified time period.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- If the yearly yield is 0, the function should return the original investment amount, as no growth would occur without yield.\n- Negative values for the yearly yield are generally not expected and", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"yearly_yield": {"type": "float", "description": "The yearly yield of the mutual fund as a percentage."}, "investment_amount": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial investment amount in the mutual fund."}, "years": {"type": "integer", "description": "The time period for which the investment is made in years."}}, "required": ["yearly_yield", "investment_amount", "years"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\n[estimate_mutual_fund_return1(yearly_yield=0.05, investment_amount=2000, years=3)]", "model_result_decoded": [{"estimate_mutual_fund_return1": {"yearly_yield": 0.05, "investment_amount": 2000, "years": 3}}], "possible_answer": [{"estimate_mutual_fund_return1": {"yearly_yield": [5.0], "investment_amount": [2000], "years": [3]}}, {"estimate_mutual_fund_return2": {"yearly_yield": [5.0], "investment_amount": [2000], "years": [3]}}, {"estimate_mutual_fund_return3": {"yearly_yield": [5.0], "investment_amount": [2000], "years": [3]}}]}

When a command is issued, it is passed as a string argument to the function, allowing for the execution of a single command or multiple commands that are chained together.

This calculation involves determining the rate of elevation change over the horizontal distance between these two points. The slope gradient is an important measure in various fields, such as geography, civil engineering, and environmental science, as it can influence factors like water runoff, erosion, and construction planning.\n\nTo perform this calculation accurately, the function requires several parameters: the latitude and longitude of both the first and second points, as well as their respective elevations. The latitude and longitude should be provided in decimal degrees, a common format used in GPS systems, where positive values indicate north and east, respectively, and negative values indicate south and west. The elevations of the two points should be given in meters above sea level.\n\nThe calculation involves determining the horizontal distance between the two coordinates, which can be computed using the Haversine formula. This formula accounts for the Earth's curvature, providing more accurate distance measurements than simple planar calculations, especially over large distances. Once the horizontal distance is determined, the difference in elevation between the two points is calculated. The slope gradient is then found by dividing the elevation difference by the horizontal distance, often expressed as a percentage or angle, indicating how steep the slope is between the two points.\n\nFor example, if Point A is at latitude 34.05, longitude -118.25 with an elevation of 100 meters, and Point B is at latitude 34.10, longitude -118.20 with an elevation of 150 meters, the function will first calculate the horizontal distance between these points using their geographical coordinates.

In such cases, the function will notify the user that no suitable libraries were found, possibly offering alternative suggestions or the option to expand the search radius.\n\nFor example, if a user is located in a city and wants to find a nearby library that offers both English fiction and Wi-Fi, they would invoke this function, which will return a list of libraries satisfying these conditions, sorted by proximity.\n\nParameters that may be passed to this function could include the user's geographical coordinates for precise location matching, a desired search radius to limit or expand the scope of the search, and any additional preferences the user might have, such as library operating hours or additional facilities like study rooms or cafes.\n\nOverall, this function streamlines the process of locating public libraries with specific amenities, enhancing the user's ability to find a library that best suits their needs.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"location": {"type": "string", "description": "The city and state, e.g. Boston, MA"}, "facilities": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["Wi-Fi", "Reading Room", "Fiction", "Children Section", "Cafe"]}, "description": "Facilities and sections in public library."}}, "required": ["location", "facilities"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\n[public_library.find_nearby1(location=\"Boston, MA\", facilities=[\"Wi-Fi\", \"Fiction\"])]\n\n```json\n[public_library.find_nearby1(location=\"Boston, MA\", facilities=[\"Wi-Fi\", \"Fiction\"])]\n```", "possible_answer": [{"public_library.find_nearby1": {"location": ["Boston, MA", "Boston, Massachusetts"], "facilities": [["Fiction", "Wi-Fi"], ["Wi-Fi", "Fiction"]]}}, {"public_library.find_nearby2": {"location": ["Boston, MA", "Boston, Massachusetts"], "facilities": [["Fiction", "Wi-Fi"], ["Wi-Fi", "Fiction"]]}}, {"public_library.find_nearby3": {"location": ["Boston, MA", "Boston, Massachusetts"], "facilities": [["Fiction", "Wi-Fi"], ["Wi-Fi", "Fiction"]]}}]}

This parameter helps narrow down the search to only those movies that have been directed by the specified individual.\n\n- **Genre**: This parameter allows users to limit their search to a particular type of movie, such as action, comedy, drama, etc. By specifying a genre, users can focus on movies that align with their thematic preferences.\n\n- **Cast**: Users can also define a search criterion based on the cast, meaning they can specify one or more actors or actresses featured in the movies they are interested in. This parameter helps filter the list of movies to include only those that feature the specified cast members.\n\nThe function subsequently processes these inputs and searches through a database or collection of movies, compiling a list that matches all the given parameters. The result is a tailored list of movies that align with the user's interests based on their specified director, genre, and cast preferences.\n\nUsage Example: A user wishing to find action movies directed by Christopher Nolan and featuring Leonardo DiCaprio would input these criteria into the function.

The primary purpose of this function is to provide users with a quick overview of the movie's key details. Here is an expanded explanation of its usage, parameters, and possible edge cases:\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **movie_title** (string): This parameter takes the title of the movie for which the brief is to be retrieved. It is case-sensitive and should be provided as a string. Ensure that the spelling and formatting of the movie title match exactly with the official title as it appears in the movie database.\n\n#### Functionality:\nUpon invocation, the function accesses a predefined movie database or API to locate and extract a brief description of the movie specified by the `movie_title` parameter. This brief typically includes essential information such as a short plot summary, genre, principal actors, and release year. The function focuses on delivering a succinct overview rather than an exhaustive analysis of the movie.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n```python\nmovie_brief = get_movie_brief(\"Inception\")\nprint(movie_brief)\n```\nIn this example, the function `get_movie_brief` is called with \"Inception\" as an argument. It returns a brief summary of the movie \"Inception\" and prints it. Users can expect a similar output format when retrieving information for other movies by substituting the title in the function call.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- **Non-existent Movie Title**: If the movie title provided does not exist in the database, the function should handle this gracefully, possibly by returning a specific error message or a null value to indicate that no information is available. \n- **Ambiguous Titles**: In cases where multiple movies share the same title, the function might return the brief of the most recent or popular one, unless additional disambiguating information is provided.\n- **Connectivity Issues**: If the function relies on an external API or online database, ensure that", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"title": {"type": "string", "description": "Title of the movie"}, "extra_info": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Option to get additional information like Director, Cast, Awards etc.", "default": "false"}}, "required": ["title"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\n[ movie_details.brief1(title=\"Interstellar\", extra_info=True) ]", "possible_answer": [{"movie_details.brief1": {"title": ["Interstellar"], "extra_info": ["", false]}}, {"movie_details.brief2": {"title": ["Interstellar"], "extra_info": ["", false]}}, {"movie_details.brief3": {"title": ["Interstellar"], "extra_info": ["", false]}}]}

It takes into account not only the total area that needs to be painted but also the efficiency of the paint being used, commonly referred to as its \"coverage efficiency.\" Additionally, it allows for the consideration of areas that should be excluded from painting, such as windows, doors, or any other features that do not require paint.\n\n#### Function Inputs:\n- **Total Area to Paint**: The overall surface area measured in square units (such as square feet or square meters) that is intended to be painted.\n- **Paint Coverage Efficiency**: A measure of how much area a unit of paint can cover, typically specified by the manufacturer (for example, 350 square feet per gallon).\n- **Exclusions**: The combined area of all surfaces that are not to be painted, such as windows or doors. This is also measured in the same square units as the total area.\n\n#### Calculation Details:\n1. **Net Paintable Area**: First, calculate the net paintable area by subtracting the exclusions from the total area to be painted. This involves simple arithmetic: \n   - `Net Paintable Area = Total Area - Exclusions`\n2. **Amount of Paint Required**: Next, determine the amount of paint needed by dividing the net paintable area by the paint coverage efficiency:\n   - `Paint Required = Net Paintable Area / Paint Coverage Efficiency`\n\nThis calculation will yield the quantity of paint necessary to cover the specified area, adjusted for both the paint's efficiency and any parts of the area that are not to be painted.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- If the exclusions are greater than or equal to the total area, the net paintable area should be considered zero, implying that no paint is required.\n- If the coverage efficiency is zero or not provided, the function should handle this as an error or return a message indicating that the coverage efficiency", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"area": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"width": {"type": "integer", "description": "The width of the area to be painted in feet."}, "height": {"type": "integer", "description": "The height of the area to be painted in feet."}}, "description": "The area to be painted."}, "paint_coverage": {"type": "integer", "description": "Coverage area per gallon of the paint in square feet.", "default": 350}, "exclusion": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"type": {"type": "string", "description": "The type of the exclusion e.g window, door etc."}, "area": {"type": "integer", "description": "The area of the exclusion in square feet."}}, "description": "Area not to be painted.

Options to include specific departments are available.The function is designed to locate nearby hospitals within a specified geographical area, based on the user's current location and a defined search radius. This allows users to find hospitals in close proximity, providing a convenient way to access medical facilities as needed. The function takes into account the user's current geographical coordinates and allows for the specification of a radius to limit the search to a certain distance, thereby focusing on hospitals within a manageable travel range.\n\nAdditionally, the function offers an option to refine the search by including specific departments, which can be particularly useful for users seeking specialized medical services. For instance, if a user requires a hospital with a cardiology department, they can tailor their search to include only hospitals that have this specific department. This feature enhances the utility of the function by enabling users to locate facilities that meet their exact medical requirements, thus saving time and ensuring that they receive the appropriate care.\n\nAn example usage of this function might involve inputting the user's current GPS coordinates and a search radius of 10 kilometers. The user can then optionally specify a department, such as emergency services, to find nearby hospitals equipped to handle urgent medical situations. This flexibility makes the function highly adaptable to various scenarios, from routine check-ups to emergency needs.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"location": {"type": "string", "description": "The city and state, e.g. Denver, CO"}, "radius": {"type": "integer", "description": "The radius within which you want to find the hospital in kms."}, "department": {"type": "string", "description": "Specific department within the hospital.

When invoking this function, users must provide two critical pieces of information: the name or identifier of the museum in question, and the specific day for which they wish to ascertain the operating hours. This function caters to individuals who require precise details about when a museum is accessible to the public, ensuring they can schedule their visit at a convenient time.\n\nThe input parameters typically include:\n1. **Museum Identifier**: This could be the name of the museum or a unique identifier that distinguishes it from other museums, ensuring the function retrieves the correct data for the intended location.\n2. **Day of the Week**: This specifies the particular day for which opening hours are sought. It can be input in various formats, such as the full name of the day (e.g., \"Monday\") or an abbreviated form (e.g., \"Mon\"), depending on the function's requirements.\n\nUpon execution, the function checks its database or predefined schedule to match the provided museum and day with the corresponding opening hours. It then outputs the opening times, often including both the opening and closing hours, allowing the user to determine when they can enter and when they must leave.\n\nIt's important to consider edge cases, such as public holidays, special events, or maintenance days when museums might deviate from their regular schedule. Users should be aware that on such occasions, the function might return modified operating hours or indicate that the museum is closed.\n\nExample usage:\n- A user wants to know the opening hours for the Museum of Modern Art on Friday. They input the museum's name and \"Friday\" as the day. The function returns that the museum opens at 10:00 AM and closes at 6:00 PM.\n- If the museum conducts special events on certain days, the function may provide additional details, such as extended hours or early closures, ensuring visitors have the most accurate and updated information available", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"museum_name": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the museum."}, "day": {"type": "string", "description": "Day of the week.", "enum": ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]}}, "required": ["museum_name", "day"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\n[get_museum_hours1(museum_name=\"Metropolitan Museum of Art\", day=\"Saturday)]", "possible_answer": [{"get_museum_hours1": {"museum_name": ["Metropolitan Museum of Art", "The Met"], "day": ["Saturday"]}}, {"get_museum_hours2": {"museum_name": ["Metropolitan Museum of Art", "The Met"], "day": ["Saturday"]}}, {"get_museum_hours3": {"museum_name": ["Metropolitan Museum of Art", "The Met"], "day": ["Saturday"]}}]}
