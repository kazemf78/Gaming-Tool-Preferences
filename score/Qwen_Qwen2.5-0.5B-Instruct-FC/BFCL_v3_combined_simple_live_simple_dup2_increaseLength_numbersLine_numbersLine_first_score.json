This calculation takes into account three crucial parameters: the mass of the substance, the temperature at which the phase transition occurs (often referred to as the phase transition temperature), and the specific latent heat of the substance for the particular phase change being considered.\n\nThe mass of the substance is a measure of how much of the material is undergoing the phase change, typically expressed in kilograms (kg). The phase transition temperature is the specific temperature at which the substance changes from one phase to another, such as from solid to liquid or liquid to gas. This temperature is characteristic of each substance and phase transition, and it remains constant during the phase change process under constant pressure conditions. The specific latent heat, usually given in joules per kilogram (J/kg), is the amount of energy required to change the phase of one kilogram of the substance without changing its temperature.\n\nBy multiplying the mass of the substance by the specific latent heat, the function calculates the total energy involved in the phase change. This energy can be positive, indicating that energy is absorbed to facilitate the phase transition (such as melting or vaporization), or negative, indicating that energy is released during the transition (such as freezing or condensation).\n\nAn example usage of the function might involve calculating the energy required to melt a block of ice. Suppose you have 2 kilograms of ice at its melting point (0\u00b0C) and you know the specific latent heat of fusion for ice is 334,000 J/kg. The function would multiply these values to determine that 668,000 joules of energy are required to melt the ice completely. Similarly, if the process were instead freezing water into ice, this same amount of energy would be released.\n\nThis function is particularly useful in thermodynamic calculations where understanding energy transfers during phase transitions is crucial.

It operates under the assumption that these two physiological metrics can provide significant insights into a person's health profile, particularly in relation to their risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **weight (float or int):** This parameter represents the individual's weight, typically measured in kilograms or pounds. Accurate weight measurement is crucial as it directly influences the calculation of body mass index (BMI), which is a commonly used proxy for assessing overweight and obesity levels. These levels are known risk factors for type 2 diabetes.\n\n- **height (float or int):** This parameter denotes the individual's height, usually recorded in meters or inches. Height is another essential component for calculating BMI. Accurate height measurement ensures the correct interpretation of BMI, which is vital for the assessment of diabetes risk.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\nThe function processes the input values to calculate the individual's BMI, which is a widely recognized metric for evaluating body fat. The BMI is computed using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{BMI} = \\frac{\\text{weight in kilograms}}{(\\text{height in meters})^2} \\]\n\nor\n\n\\[ \\text{BMI} = \\frac{\\text{weight in pounds}}{(\\text{height in inches})^2} \\times 703 \\]\n\nOnce the BMI is calculated, the function uses this value as a core determinant to predict the probability of type 2 diabetes. The function may implement predictive algorithms or reference medical data that correlate BMI ranges with diabetes risk levels.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n1. **Unrealistic Weight or Height Values:** If the provided weight or height is zero or negative, the function should handle these cases gracefully, possibly by returning an error message or requesting valid inputs.\n\n2. **Extremely High or Low BMI:** For individuals with very high or very", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"weight": {"type": "integer", "description": "Weight of the person in lbs."}, "height": {"type": "integer", "description": "Height of the person in inches."}, "activity_level": {"type": "string", "enum": ["sedentary", "lightly active", "moderately active", "very active", "extra active"], "description": "Physical activity level of the person."}}, "required": ["weight", "height", "activity_level"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"diabetes_prediction2": {"weight": 150, "height": 5, "activity_level": "lightly active"}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"diabetes_prediction2": {"weight": 150, "height": 5, "activity_level": "lightly active"}}], "possible_answer": [{"diabetes_prediction1": {"weight": [150], "height": [70], "activity_level": ["lightly active"]}}, {"diabetes_prediction2": {"weight": [150], "height": [70], "activity_level": ["lightly active"]}}, {"diabetes_prediction3": {"weight": [150], "height": [70], "activity_level": ["lightly active"]}}]}

The function operates by analyzing a dataset or a list of available restaurants, evaluating them against these criteria, and ultimately providing the restaurant that holds the highest rating among those that fit the given parameters.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **Cuisine**: This parameter specifies the type of cuisine the user is interested in. It acts as a filter to narrow down the restaurant list to those that serve the desired type of food. For instance, this could be \"Italian,\" \"Japanese,\" \"Mexican,\" etc.\n\n2. **Location**: This parameter defines the geographical area where the search for the highest rated restaurant should be conducted. It could be a city, a neighborhood, or a specific area code, allowing the function to limit its search to a manageable and relevant scope.\n\n3. **Condition**: This could represent any additional requirement or preference that the user wants the restaurant to meet. This condition could be related to price range, dietary options, ambiance, or any other factor that could influence the decision. The function uses this condition to further refine the list of qualified restaurants.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\n- The function first filters the restaurants based on the specified cuisine, ensuring that only those that serve the desired type of food are considered.\n- Next, it narrows down this list to include only those restaurants that are located within the given geographical area, as defined by the location parameter.\n- It then applies any extra condition provided by the user, further filtering the restaurants to meet this specific requirement.\n- Among the remaining restaurants, the function evaluates their ratings, which could be based on customer reviews or a rating system.\n- Finally, it retrieves and returns the restaurant with the highest rating from this refined list.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n-", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"cuisine": {"type": "string", "description": "Cuisine of the restaurant."}, "location": {"type": "string", "description": "City where restaurant is located."}, "condition": {"type": "string", "description": "Condition to be met by the restaurant (e.g., operating days, amenities, etc.)"}}, "required": ["cuisine", "location", "condition"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"get_restaurant1": {"cuisine": "sushi", "location": "Boston", "condition": "sundays"}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"get_restaurant1": {"cuisine": "sushi", "location": "Boston", "condition": "sundays"}}], "possible_answer": [{"get_restaurant1": {"cuisine": ["sushi"], "location": ["Boston"], "condition": ["open on Sundays", "opens on Sundays"]}}, {"get_restaurant2": {"cuisine": ["sushi"], "location": ["Boston"], "condition": ["open on Sundays", "opens on Sundays"]}}, {"get_restaurant3": {"cuisine": ["sushi"], "location": ["Boston"], "condition": ["open on Sundays", "opens on Sundays"]}}]}

The preprocessing involves two key steps: normalization of numerical data and encoding of categorical variables. \n\nFirstly, during the normalization step, the function scales numerical values to a consistent range. This typically involves transforming the numerical data so that it fits within a specific range, often between 0 and 1, or assigning it a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This scaling is crucial for many machine learning algorithms that are sensitive to the magnitude of input values, ensuring that no particular feature dominates due to its scale.\n\nSecondly, the function handles categorical variables by encoding them. This involves converting categorical data, which could be in the form of strings or other discrete identifiers, into a numerical format. Common encoding methods include one-hot encoding, where each category level is transformed into a binary vector, or label encoding, where each category is assigned a unique integer. This transformation is essential because machine learning models require input data to be in a numerical format to process it effectively.\n\nBy executing these steps, the function ensures that the input data is consistently formatted and ready for model training and evaluation.

Random Forest is a versatile machine learning algorithm capable of performing both regression and classification tasks, making it a popular choice for various types of predictive modeling. This algorithm operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees during the training phase and outputting either the mode of the classes (classification) or the mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.\n\n### Parameters:\n\n1. **Data**: The primary input for the function, which should be a structured dataset, typically in the form of a DataFrame or similar data structure. This dataset must contain both the features (independent variables) and the target variable (dependent variable) that the model will learn to predict.\n\n2. **Features**: The columns in the dataset that will be used as input for the model. These should be carefully selected and pre-processed to ensure effective model training. Features may need to be scaled or encoded depending on their types and the requirements of the model.\n\n3. **Target**: The specific column in the dataset that the model will learn to predict. It represents the output variable and should be clearly specified to guide the training process.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- **Hyperparameters**: While the basic function description does not specify, typically, a Random Forest model requires several hyperparameters such as the number of trees in the forest (`n_estimators`), the maximum depth of each tree (`max_depth`), and criteria for splitting nodes (`criterion`). These hyperparameters can significantly influence the model's performance and may need to be tuned for optimal results.\n\n- **Validation**: It's generally recommended to split the dataset into training and testing subsets to evaluate the model's performance properly. This step ensures that the model is not only fitting the training data but is also capable of generalizing to unseen data.\n\n- **Edge Cases**: When training the Random Forest model, it is important to consider edge cases such as missing data, multicollinearity", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"n_estimators": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of trees in the forest."}, "max_depth": {"type": "integer", "description": "The maximum depth of the tree."}, "data": {"type": "any", "description": "The training data for the model."}}, "required": ["n_estimators", "max_depth", "data"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "Error during inference: name 'my_data' is not defined", "model_result_decoded": [], "possible_answer": [{"random_forest.train1": {"n_estimators": [100], "max_depth": [5], "data": ["my_data"]}}, {"random_forest.train2": {"n_estimators": [100], "max_depth": [5], "data": ["my_data"]}}, {"random_forest.train3": {"n_estimators": [100], "max_depth": [5], "data": ["my_data"]}}]}

This allows for systematic categorization of queries based on their relevance to certain pre-defined intents.\n\nThe function can handle multiple intents at once, with each intent being a distinct parameter. For example, if the function is designed to classify queries into intents such as \"purchase\", \"support\", and \"feedback\", you would pass a list of queries that correspond to each of these intents.

This operation involves taking each string element from the list in sequential order and combining them into one long string without any separator or additional characters between the original strings. The list serves as the input to the function, and the strings are concatenated in the exact order they appear in the list. \n\n### Parameters\n\n- **strings_list (list of str):** This parameter represents the input list containing the strings to be concatenated. Each element of this list should be a string. The function will process each element, assuming all are valid strings, and append them together.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- If the list is empty, meaning there are no string elements to concatenate, the function will return an empty string as the output.\n- If the list contains only one string, the function will return that single string itself, as there is nothing else to concatenate it with.\n\n### Usage Examples\n\n1. **Basic Concatenation:**\n   ```python\n   result = concatenate_strings([\"Hello\", \" \", \"world\"])\n   # Result: \"Hello world\"\n   ```\n   In this example, the function concatenates the words \"Hello\", a space character, and \"world\" into a single string.\n\n2. **Single Element List:**\n   ```python\n   result = concatenate_strings([\"SingleString\"])\n   # Result: \"SingleString\"\n   ```\n   The list contains only one string, so the function simply returns that string.\n\n3. **Empty List:**\n   ```python\n   result = concatenate_strings([])\n   # Result: \"\"\n   ```\n   Here, since the list is empty, the function returns an empty string.\n\nThe function primarily assumes that all provided elements within the list are strings.

NPV is a financial metric used to assess the profitability of an investment or project by calculating the present value of expected future cash flows, subtracting the initial investment cost. \n\nThis function takes into account multiple parameters:\n\n1. **Future Cash Flows**: These are the anticipated cash inflows or outflows at different time periods in the future.

Compound interest is the interest on a loan or deposit that is calculated based on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. This calculation is crucial for understanding how investments grow over time or how debt can accumulate.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **Principal Amount (P)**: This is the initial sum of money that has been deposited or loaned. It is the base amount on which the interest will be calculated.\n- **Annual Interest Rate (r)**: The interest rate per period, usually expressed as a decimal. For example, an interest rate of 5% would be represented as 0.05.\n- **Number of Times Interest is Compounded Per Year (n)**: This defines how many times the interest is applied to the principal balance within one year. Common compounding frequencies include annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, and daily.\n- **Time in Years (t)**: The total time the money is invested or borrowed for, in years.\n\n#### Calculation:\nThe compound interest is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( A \\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- \\( P \\) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n- \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate (in decimal form).\n- \\( n \\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n- \\( t \\) is the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- If the interest rate is zero, the accumulated amount will equal the principal amount since no interest is accrued.\n- If the number of times interest is compounded per year is one, the formula simplifies to the calculation for annually compounded interest.\n- If the time", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"principal": {"type": "integer", "description": "The principal amount that the interest is applied to."}, "rate": {"type": "float", "description": "The annual interest rate.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.This function is designed specifically to execute system-level commands through the `os.system()` method available in Python, and it is tailored for use on Windows operating systems. The `os.system()` function is a simple way to run commands as if they were being executed directly in the command line interface or Command Prompt on a Windows machine. One of the key features of this functionality is its capability to handle not only individual commands but also to execute multiple commands that are linked or chained together using the `&&` operator. This operator serves as a conditional execution mechanism: if the command preceding the `&&` operator completes successfully, the subsequent command will be executed. This allows the user to create a sequence of commands that depend on the successful execution of the previous ones, effectively enabling more complex operations to be performed in a single call to the function. \n\nFor instance, if a user wishes to navigate to a specific directory and then list its contents, they might chain these commands as follows: `cd my_directory && dir`. In this example, if the change directory command (`cd my_directory`) runs successfully, the directory listing command (`dir`) will then execute. Such chaining allows for efficient command execution without the need for multiple separate function calls.\n\nIt is important to note that while `os.system()` is straightforward to use, any output generated by the executed command will be sent directly to the standard output stream, typically the console. Additionally, the function returns the exit status of the command run, where a value of `0` generally indicates successful execution, and any non-zero value indicates an error or abnormal termination. Furthermore, the `os.system()` method does not capture the output of the command; if capturing the output is necessary, alternative methods such as `subprocess.run()` should be considered.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'The function provided is designed to execute system-level commands by utilizing the `os.system()` function from the Python standard library, specifically tailored for use on Windows operating systems. This functionality is pivotal when you require your Python script to interact directly with the operating system's command line interface. The `os.system()` call allows a Python script to execute a command as if it were typed directly into the Command Prompt.\n\nFor executing the command, you simply need to pass the desired system command as a string argument to the `os.system()` function.

If the first command fails, the second command will not execute, thanks to the '&&' chaining.\n\nThis function is limited to the Windows operating system and relies on the capabilities and available commands of the Windows Command Prompt environment. It's important to note that while `os.system()` is a straightforward way to invoke system commands from within a Python script, it does not provide access to more advanced features such as capturing the output of the command.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.This function is designed to execute system-level commands specifically on Windows operating systems by utilizing the `os.system()` method from Python's `os` module. The `os.system()` function is a straightforward way to run a command as if it were being executed from the Windows command prompt or console. It is important to note that this function is particularly useful for running commands that are native to the Windows operating system, taking advantage of its command-line interface.\n\nThe function can handle and execute both single commands and multiple commands that are chained together. Chaining commands is achieved using the '&&' operator, which allows for sequential execution. When commands are chained with '&&', each command is executed in the order they are specified, and the next command is executed only if the previous command succeeds. This can be particularly useful for performing a series of dependent operations, ensuring that each command in the chain only runs if the preceding command succeeds without errors.\n\nFor example, if you want to navigate to a directory and then list its contents, you could use the following chained command: `\"cd C:\\\\example_directory && dir\"`. In this example, the function will first attempt to change the directory to `C:\\example_directory`. If successful, it will then execute the `dir` command to list the contents of that directory. If the `cd` command fails, for instance, if the directory does not exist, the `dir` command will not be executed.\n\nIt should be noted that this function is synchronous, meaning it will block the execution of further Python code until the system command has completed. Additionally, the return value of `os.system()` represents the exit status of the command executed, with a return value of `0` typically indicating success, and any non-zero value indicating an error occurred. This can be used to handle errors gracefully in the implementation of the function.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

It provides a targeted search by enabling the specification of several key parameters: the company name, the time frame during which the lawsuits were filed, and the geographical location where these legal actions took place.\n\nParameters:\n\n1. **Company Name**: This parameter requires the input of the name of the company for which the user wants to find related lawsuits. The company name should be entered as a string. It is crucial to provide the exact name or known variations to ensure accurate search results.\n\n2. **Date Range**: This parameter specifies the time period during which the lawsuits of interest were filed. It typically includes a start date and an end date, both formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD'. This allows users to narrow down the search results to a specific time frame, ensuring relevance and precision in the findings.\n\n3. **Location**: This parameter indicates the geographical area or jurisdiction where the lawsuits were filed. The location can be specified by country, state, city, or other relevant jurisdictional identifiers.

For complex tasks, create and run a .bat file.The function is designed to execute a specified command on a Windows operating system environment using the `os.system()` function from Python's `os` module. This function is particularly tailored for scenarios where you need to run shell commands directly from a Python script. \n\nWhen using this function to execute multiple commands in sequence, you should separate each command with the '&&' operator. This ensures that commands are executed one after the other in the specified order, and execution will stop if any command fails.

When executing multiple commands, `os.system('cd C:\\\\ && dir')` will change the directory to the root of the C drive and then list its contents. For more advanced operations, such as setting environment variables or looping through commands, consider creating a batch file and running it through `os.system('C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\your\\\\script.bat')`. \n\nBe aware that the `os.system()` function returns a system-dependent status code, which can be used to determine the success or failure of the", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The Windows command line instruction(s) to be executed.

This function is particularly useful for users who need to find suitable service providers quickly and efficiently, based on their specific needs and geographical preferences.\n\n### Parameters:\n\n- **service_type (str):** This parameter specifies the category or type of service required. It is a string that indicates the nature of the service being sought, allowing the function to filter the service providers accordingly. For example, valid inputs might include \"plumbing\", \"house cleaning\", or \"automotive repair\".\n\n- **location (str):** This parameter defines the geographical area where the service is needed. It is a string that can represent a city, town, zip code, or any other location identifier. This helps the function limit the search results to service providers who are available in the specified region.\n\n### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose you are looking for a plumber in the New York City area. You would call the function with the parameters `service_type=\"plumbing\"` and `location=\"New York City\"`. The function would then return a list of plumbers who offer services in New York City, allowing you to choose from those options based on further preferences such as price, ratings, or availability.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n\n- If no matching service providers are found based on the given criteria, the function should ideally return an empty list, indicating that no suitable providers are available for the specified service type and location.\n\n- It is important to ensure that both parameters are correctly formatted and", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["service_id"], "properties": {"service_id": {"type": "integer", "description": "Unique identifier for the service type.

Although renewable sources generally produce significantly lower emissions, this parameter accounts for any emissions that might occur during manufacturing, installation, or maintenance of renewable energy systems.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- **emissions_saved (float):** The function returns a floating-point number that quantifies the potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. It is calculated by subtracting the emissions produced by the renewable energy source from those produced by the current energy source.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\nConsider a scenario where a coal-powered plant emits 10,000 tons of CO2-equivalent gases annually. By switching to a solar power system that generates 500 tons of emissions per year, the function can be used to compute the emissions saved with the following invocation:\n\n```python\nemissions_saved = calculate_emissions_saved(10000, 500)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `emissions_saved` will be 9,500 tons, representing the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions achieved by the transition.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\nThe function should handle situations where the emissions from the renewable source are equal to or greater than those from the current source. In such cases, the potential savings would be zero,", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"energy_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of the renewable energy source."}, "usage_duration": {"type": "integer", "description": "Usage duration in months."}, "region": {"type": "string", "description": "The region where you use energy.

It operates by filtering movies based on a combination of three key attributes: the director, the genre, and the cast.\n\nFirstly, the user specifies the director whose movies they are interested in. The function then searches through a database or dataset to identify all movies associated with that director. This means that if a director has multiple entries or aliases, the function should account for these to ensure accurate retrieval.\n\nSecondly, the user provides a genre, which serves as another filter in the search process. The function cross-references the genre specified with the genres tagged to each movie in the dataset. This ensures that only the movies fitting the specified genre criteria are included in the results.\n\nFinally, the function considers the cast specified by the user. The user can provide names of actors or actresses, and the function will search for movies that include these cast members. It is important that the function handles cases where a cast member might have multiple roles or pseudonyms, ensuring that all relevant movies are captured.\n\nThe function combines these three elements\u2014director, genre, and cast\u2014to produce a final list of movies that match all the user's specified criteria. It returns this list in a format that is convenient for further analysis or consumption by other parts of the application or system.\n\nIt is crucial for the user to understand that the function's ability to retrieve movies is contingent upon the accuracy and completeness of the data available in the database. If the database lacks information on certain movies or has incorrect details about directors, genres, or cast members, the results may be incomplete or inaccurate. Additionally, in cases where the user provides conflicting criteria (e.g., a director not associated with a specified genre), the function might return an empty list, indicating no matches were found.\n\nFor effective use, the user is advised to ensure that the criteria provided are as specific and accurate as possible.

The new date or time for the event must be provided by the user in the ISO-8601 format, which ensures a standardized and unambiguous representation of the date and time across different systems and platforms.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **newDateTime**: A string representing the new date and/or time for the event. This should be formatted according to the ISO-8601 standard. ISO-8601 is a widely accepted format for date and time representation, using the pattern `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss\u00b1hh:mm` for full date and time with time zone information, or subsets thereof for partial representations.\n\n#### Functionality:\n- The function takes the `newDateTime` as input and updates the scheduled event to this specified date or time.\n- It handles the conversion of the provided ISO-8601 string into a format that the event management system can process.\n- It ensures that the event is moved accurately to the new time slot, taking into account any necessary adjustments for time zones if included in the provided string.\n\n#### Edge Cases and Considerations:\n- The function expects a correctly formatted ISO-8601 string; any deviations or formatting errors may result in failure to reschedule the event.\n- If only the date is provided without a time component (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD`), the assumption needs to be made regarding the default time, which may depend on the system configuration or user specification.\n- If the input includes a time zone offset (e.g., `\u00b1hh:mm`), the function will account for this in adjusting the event's timing.\n- Changes to the event that conflict with existing events or schedules may require additional handling outside the scope of this function.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nSuppose an existing meeting originally scheduled for `2023-03-01T15:00:00Z` needs to be", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["event_identifier", "new_datetime"], "properties": {"event_identifier": {"type": "string", "description": "The unique identifier of the event to be rescheduled."}, "new_datetime": {"type": "string", "description": "The new date and time for the event in ISO-8601 format, such as '2023-04-15T13:45:00Z'."}}}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"reschedule_event1": {"event_identifier": "456123", "new_datetime": "2023-10-24T14:30:00Z"}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"reschedule_event1": {"event_identifier": "456123", "new_datetime": "2023-10-24T14:30:00Z"}}], "possible_answer": [{"reschedule_event1": {"event_identifier": ["456123"], "new_datetime": ["2022-10-30T16:30:00Z"]}}, {"reschedule_event2": {"event_identifier": ["456123"], "new_datetime": ["2022-10-30T16:30:00Z"]}}, {"reschedule_event3": {"event_identifier": ["456123"], "new_datetime": ["2022-10-30T16:30:00Z"]}}]}

Additionally, the departure time needs to be specified in a recognized format, such as ISO 8601 or another standardized time format, ensuring that the booking system correctly processes the intended schedule.\n\nFurthermore, this function offers the flexibility to book a round-trip flight by allowing the user to optionally specify a return time. If the user chooses to include a return time, it must also follow an accepted format similar to that of the departure time. This ensures that the return segment of the trip is correctly scheduled in the system's itinerary. If a return time is not provided, the function defaults to booking a one-way trip, focusing solely on the outbound journey.\n\nTo ensure successful execution, users should verify that all provided details are accurate and complete, as incorrect or incomplete information may lead to booking errors or unsuccessful transactions.

Once the function identifies the desired song based on the provided search terms, it proceeds to play the song for the user.\n\n### Detailed Explanation:\n\n- **Input Parameter**: The function accepts a single input parameter, which is a string representing the search query. This query typically includes keywords related to the song, such as the song's title, artist name, or album name. The accuracy and specificity of this search query will directly influence the search results, so including detailed information (e.g., both the artist's name and song title) is recommended to narrow down the results effectively.\n\n- **Search Process**: The function utilizes Spotify's search capabilities to parse the input query and scour the platform's vast catalog of music content. It attempts to match the query against available songs, considering various metadata elements like song titles, artists, and albums to find the best match.\n\n- **Playback Initiation**: Upon identifying a song that closely matches the search criteria, the function initiates playback. This involves sending a command to Spotify's servers to stream the identified song to the user's device, thus allowing the user to listen to the chosen track directly through Spotify.\n\n### Edge Cases and Considerations:\n\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Queries**: If the provided search query is too vague or does not correspond to any recognizable song in the Spotify library, the function may fail to find a match. In such cases, it might return an error or prompt the user to refine their search input.\n\n- **Playback Restrictions**: The ability to play a song may depend on the user's Spotify account type (free or premium) and their current device's compatibility with Spotify's streaming services.\n\n### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose a user wants to listen to the song \"Shape of You\" by Ed Sheeran.

The input ensures that the statistics are retrieved for the right individual without any ambiguity.\n\n- **Output**: The function outputs a detailed statistical report, which may include various metrics such as points scored, assists, rebounds, steals, blocks, shooting percentage, minutes played, and any other relevant performance indicators from the player's last game.\n\n- **Edge Cases**: It handles scenarios where a player might not have played in a recent game due to injury, rest, or other reasons. In such cases, the function should ideally return a message indicating no recent game data is available, or it could return the last available set of statistics from a prior game.\n\n- **Usage Example**: Suppose a user wants to find out how a player performed in their last game. They would call this function with the player's ID as an input parameter. The function would then query the database or data source and return the player's performance statistics from their latest game.\n\n- **Parameter Explanation**: The key parameter for this function is the player's identifier, which uniquely distinguishes the player in the database. This could be in the form of a numeric ID, a combination of name and team attributes, or another unique key that ensures the player is correctly identified.\n\nIn summary, the Get Last Game Statistics for a Specific Player function is a valuable tool for obtaining the most recent performance data", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"player_name": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the basketball player."}, "team": {"type": "string", "description": "The team that player currently plays for."}, "metrics": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["Points", "Rebounds", "Assists", "Blocks"]}, "description": "Specific metrics to retrieve.

This criterion ensures that only sushi places with a satisfactory level of customer feedback are included in the results. If no places meet the specified review rate, the function might return an empty list.\n\n3. **Top Number**: This parameter specifies the number of top-rated sushi places the user wants to retrieve. It should be provided as a positive integer. The function will sort the sushi places meeting the review rate criterion in descending order of their ratings and select the top entries up to the number specified by this parameter. If there are fewer places that qualify than the number requested, the function will return as many as are available.\n\n### Usage Example\n\nConsider a scenario where a user wishes to find the top 3 sushi places in \"San Francisco\" with a minimum review rate of 4.5. The function call would look like this:\n\n```python\nbest_sushi_places = get_best_sushi_places(city=\"San Francisco\", review_rate=4.5, top_number=3)\n```\n\nUpon execution, the function would return a list of sushi restaurants", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"city": {"type": "string", "description": "The city in which to look for the sushi places."}, "top": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of top sushi places to be returned."}, "review_rate": {"type": "float", "description": "The review rating to filter the sushi places.
