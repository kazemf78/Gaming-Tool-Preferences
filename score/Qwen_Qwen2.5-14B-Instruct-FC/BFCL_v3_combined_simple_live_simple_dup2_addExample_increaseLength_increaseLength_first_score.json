The function assumes that the system is in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings, maintaining a constant temperature.\n\nIn addition to being isothermal, the process is also reversible.

Population density is defined as the number of people living per unit area of land, typically measured in people per square kilometer or people per square mile. To calculate this, the function requires two key pieces of data: the total population of the country in the specified year and the land area of the country.\n\nParameters:\n\n1. `country_name` (string): The name of the country for which you want to calculate the population density. This should be the official name as recognized in international databases to ensure accuracy.\n\n2. `year` (integer): The specific year you are interested in. This parameter helps fetch the population data corresponding to that year. It should be in the format of a four-digit year, for example, 2020.\n\nUsage:\n\nTo use this function, ensure you have reliable datasets that can provide the total population and land area for the country in the specified year. It's important to have accurate data since the function depends on these inputs to deliver a precise result.\n\nFor example, if you want to calculate the population density of Japan in the year 2020, you would need to know Japan's total population and land area for that year. Once you have these, the function will divide the total population by the land area, resulting in the population density.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\n- If the population data is unavailable for the specified year, the function may return an error or a null value depending on the implementation.\n- Similarly, if the land area is zero or not defined, handling such cases appropriately is crucial to avoid division by zero errors.\n\nThe function is instrumental in demographic studies, urban planning, and environmental assessments, where understanding how densely populated a country is can inform a wide range of strategic decisions.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"country": {"type": "string", "description": "The country for which the density needs to be calculated."}, "year": {"type": "string", "description": "The year in which the density is to be calculated."}, "population": {"type": "integer", "description": "The population of the country."}, "land_area": {"type": "integer", "description": "The land area of the country in square kilometers."}}, "required": ["country", "year", "population", "land_area"]}}, {"name": "calculate_density2", "description": "Calculate the population density of a specific country in a specific year.Example: calculate_density(country=\"Canada\", year=\"2020\", population=37742154, land_area=9984670) returns 3.78.\n\nExample: calculate_density(country=\"India\", year=\"2021\", population=1393409038, land_area=3287263) returns 424.74.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"country": {"type": "string", "description": "The country for which the density needs to be calculated."}, "year": {"type": "string", "description": "The year in which the density is to be calculated."}, "population": {"type": "integer", "description": "The population of the country."}, "land_area": {"type": "integer", "description": "The land area of the country in square kilometers."}}, "required": ["country", "year", "population", "land_area"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"calculate_density2": {"country": "Brazil", "year": "2022", "population": 213000000, "land_area": 8511965}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"calculate_density2": {"country": "Brazil", "year": "2022", "population": 213000000, "land_area": 8511965}}], "possible_answer": [{"calculate_density1": {"country": ["Brazil"], "year": ["2022"], "population": [213000000], "land_area": [8500000]}}, {"calculate_density2": {"country": ["Brazil"], "year": ["2022"], "population": [213000000], "land_area": [8500000]}}, {"calculate_density3": {"country": ["Brazil"], "year": ["2022"], "population": [213000000], "land_area": [8500000]}}]}

When invoked, it takes an input list containing elements that can be compared with each other, such as numbers or strings. The function's operation is contingent upon a specified parameter or flag which determines the order of sorting. \n\nWhen the ascending order is chosen, the function rearranges the list so that each element is less than or equal to the element that follows it. This means numbers will start from the smallest and increment to the largest, or strings will proceed alphabetically from A to Z. Conversely, when the descending order is selected, the list is reordered such that each element is greater than or equal to the one that follows, resulting in numbers being sorted from largest to smallest, or strings from Z to A.\n\nThe function handles a variety of lists, even those that are initially unsorted, and returns a new list in the desired order without altering the original list unless specified otherwise.

It accomplishes this by determining the positions of each hand relative to 12 o'clock and then computes the angle formed between them.\n\n### How the Function Works:\n1. **Input Parameters**: The function requires two input parameters representing the time of interest: \n   - `hour`: An integer value ranging from 0 to 23, representing the hour portion of the time. This allows for calculation in both AM and PM formats.\n   - `minute`: An integer value ranging from 0 to 59, indicating the minute portion of the time.\n\n2. **Position Calculation**:\n   - **Hour Hand Position**: The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours. Therefore, it moves 30 degrees per hour (360 degrees / 12 hours). Additionally, for every minute that passes, the hour hand moves 0.5 degrees (30 degrees / 60 minutes).\n   - **Minute Hand Position**: The minute hand completes a full circle, or 360 degrees, in 60 minutes. Hence, it moves 6 degrees per minute (360 degrees / 60 minutes).\n\n3. **Angle Calculation**:\n   - **Raw Angle**: The function first calculates the absolute difference between the angles of the hour and minute hands.\n   - **Minimal Angle**: Since the clock is circular, the function determines the smaller angle. This is done by taking the minimum between the raw angle and 360 degrees minus the raw angle, ensuring that the angle is always 180 degrees or less.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- **Exact hour**: If the minute is set to zero, the calculation must handle the scenario where the minute hand is at the 12 o'clock position, and the position of the hour hand is straightforwardly `hour * 30` degrees.\n- **Midnight and Noon**: These times are special cases", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"hours": {"type": "integer", "description": "The hour on the clock face."}, "minutes": {"type": "integer", "description": "The minutes on the clock face."}, "round_to": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of decimal places to round the result to, default is 2."}}, "required": ["hours", "minutes"]}}, {"name": "calculate_clock_angle2", "description": "Calculate the angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock at a given time.Example: calculate_clock_angle(hours=3, minutes=15) returns 7.5\n\nExample: calculate_clock_angle(hours=9, minutes=0) returns 90.0\n\nExample: calculate_clock_angle(hours=12, minutes=30, round_to=1) returns 165.0", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"hours": {"type": "integer", "description": "The hour on the clock face."}, "minutes": {"type": "integer", "description": "The minutes on the clock face."}, "round_to": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of decimal places to round the result to, default is 2."}}, "required": ["hours", "minutes"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"calculate_clock_angle1": {"hour": 18, "minute": 30}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"calculate_clock_angle1": {"hour": 18, "minute": 30}}], "possible_answer": [{"calculate_clock_angle1": {"hours": [6], "minutes": [30], "round_to": ["", 2]}}, {"calculate_clock_angle2": {"hours": [6], "minutes": [30], "round_to": ["", 2]}}, {"calculate_clock_angle3": {"hours": [6], "minutes": [30], "round_to": ["", 2]}}]}

It then returns the sum of the original purchase amount and the calculated tax, providing the total amount that should be paid by the customer. \n\nThe function takes two primary inputs: the purchase amount and the jurisdiction. The purchase amount is a numeric value representing the cost of goods or services before taxes are applied. This value should be non-negative, as negative values would not typically represent a valid transaction. The jurisdiction input specifies the geographical or regulatory area whose sales tax rules are to be applied. This could be a state, city, or other defined region with its own tax rate, and it determines the percentage rate used in calculating the tax.\n\nInternally, the function multiplies the purchase amount by the sales tax rate associated with the jurisdiction to obtain the tax amount. It then adds this tax amount to the initial purchase amount to arrive at the total amount with tax included. This total is then returned as the output of the function.\n\nUsers should ensure that the jurisdiction provided is valid and supported by the function, as different jurisdictions can have varying tax rates and rules. Additionally, the function assumes that the applicable tax rate for the given jurisdiction is pre-defined and accurate.

Allows for the bulk recording of query classifications in one function call.This function is designed to efficiently manage and record the classification of a large number of queries by associating them with specific intent names. It achieves this by leveraging keyword arguments, where each keyword corresponds to an intent name, and the associated value is a collection of queries that share this intent. By using this approach, users can perform bulk recordings of query classifications in a single function call, significantly streamlining the process.\n\n### Parameters\n\n- **intent_name**: Keyword arguments where each keyword represents the name of an intent. This acts as a label that describes the purpose or goal of the queries associated with it.\n\n- **queries**: The values that accompany each intent name keyword argument. These are the actual queries that need to be classified. They can be provided in various iterable forms, such as lists or tuples, allowing for flexibility in input data structures.\n\n### Functionality\n\nWhen you call this function, it processes each keyword argument, taking the name of the keyword as the intent and the corresponding value as the list of queries. The function then records the association between each query and its intent, effectively classifying them in bulk. This method is particularly useful for applications that require organizing a large number of queries systematically, such as natural language processing tasks, chatbots, or automated customer service systems.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- If no queries are provided for a given intent, the function will simply record the intent with an empty list of queries, ensuring that all intents are processed but without any associated data.\n  \n- If duplicate queries are provided under the same intent, the function will still record each instance, as this might be intentional depending on the use case (e.g., tracking frequency of certain queries).\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\n# Example of how to call the function with multiple intents and their associated queries\nrecord_classifications(\n    greeting=[\"Hello\", \"Hi there\", \"Good morning\"],\n    farewell=[\"Goodbye\", \"See you later\", \"Take care\"],\n    inquiry=[\"What's the weather", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["acc_routing_start", "atm_finder_start", "faq_link_accounts_start", "get_balance_start", "get_transactions_start", "outofscope"], "properties": {"acc_routing_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries requesting the bank routing numbers or account numbers."}, "atm_finder_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for locations of ATMs, specified in the format of 'City, State (abbr)', such as 'Berkeley, CA' or 'New York, NY'."}, "faq_link_accounts_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to linking accounts within the bank's system."}, "get_balance_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for account balances, available funds, or other financial balances."}, "get_transactions_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to viewing transactions, deposits, purchases, and transaction details."}, "outofscope": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries that do not classify to any other available intents."}}}}, {"name": "record2", "description": "Records classifications for a series of queries based on the intent names provided as keyword arguments.

For example, if the string \"hello\" is passed as input, the function will return \"olleh\". This operation is particularly useful for operations that require backward iteration or when comparing mirrored text forms.\n\nIn the case of boolean inputs, the function operates by returning the logical negation of the input value. This means if the input is `True`, the function will return `False`, and if `False` is provided, it will return `True`. This aspect of the function is valuable in scenarios where a toggle switch or logical inversion is required.\n\nWhen the input is a number, the function calculates and returns its negative value. This involves changing the sign of the number from positive to negative or vice versa. For instance, if the input is `10`, the function will return `-10`; similarly, if the input is `-5`, the function will return `5`. The function thus effectively inverts the numeric value, which can be particularly useful in mathematical computations where sign inversion is necessary.\n\nOverall, the function is versatile, capable of handling different data types, and performs distinct operations based on the type of the input.

The primary goal of this function is to interact with network management systems or APIs to extract information about the nodes, which can include switches, routers, or other networking devices, that are part of a particular fabric. \n\n### Parameters\n\n- **fabric_id**: This is a crucial parameter that uniquely identifies the fabric within the network for which the node information is being requested. It ensures that the correct set of nodes associated with the specified fabric is retrieved. It is important that this parameter is accurately provided in the request to avoid errors or retrieving data from an unintended fabric.\n\n### Usage Example\n\nWhen utilizing this function, it should be integrated into a system where network fabrics are managed, such as a data center configuration management tool or network orchestration service. Below is a hypothetical example of how this function might be called:\n\n```python\n# Assuming 'network_api_client' is an instance of a client capable of making HTTP requests\nfabric_id = \"fabric-12345\"\nnodes_list = network_api_client.get_nodes_by_fabric(fabric_id)\nprint(nodes_list)\n```\n\nIn this example, the function is expected to send a GET request, typically to a RESTful API endpoint, passing the fabric identifier as part of the URL or query parameters. The response, ideally in a structured format like JSON or XML, will contain the list of nodes associated with the specified fabric, which can then be processed or displayed according to the needs of the application.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- **Invalid Fabric ID**: If an incorrect or non-existent fabric ID is provided, the function may return an error response. It is essential to handle such cases by implementing error-checking mechanisms.\n  \n- **Network Errors**: Network issues, such as timeouts or connectivity problems, may prevent the successful execution of the GET request.

This string represents the exact command you would type into the Windows Command Prompt. The `os.system()` function will then pass this string to the operating system's command processor, where it is executed as if it had been entered manually.\n\nFor example, if you wish to execute the `dir` command to list directory contents, you would use the function as follows: `os.system(\"dir\")`. This effectively opens a new command shell, executes the `dir` command, and then returns the control back to the Python script upon completion of the command.\n\nIt's important to note that `os.system()` is a simple way to execute commands but may not be suitable for all use cases, especially when capturing the command's output is necessary. In such cases, using more advanced modules like `subprocess` might be preferable.\n\nAdditionally, the function's return value is the exit status of the command executed. Typically, a return value of `0` indicates success, while any other value suggests an error occurred. This behavior aligns with the convention used in shell scripting where the command's exit status can be used for conditional logic based on the success or failure of the executed command.\n\nCare should be taken with the input command to avoid security risks, such as command injection, especially if the command string includes user-generated input.

It does so by taking into account three primary parameters: the total initial investment amount, the annual yield rate, and the investment time period. These parameters are crucial for accurately determining how much the initial investment will grow over the specified time period.\n\n- **Total Initial Investment**: This parameter represents the amount of money initially invested in the mutual fund. It serves as the principal amount from which the investment will grow, based on the specified yield rate.\n\n- **Annual Yield Rate**: The annual yield rate is expressed as a percentage and signifies the expected rate of return on the investment each year. It is used to calculate the compound interest earned on the initial investment over the specified period.\n\n- **Time Period**: This parameter specifies the duration, typically in years, for which the investment will be held in the mutual fund. It determines how many times the annual yield rate should be applied to the initial investment.\n\nThe function employs the principles of compound interest to calculate the final balance. Compound interest involves reinvesting the earnings each year, so that interest is earned on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous years.

The `os.system()` function is a straightforward way to invoke a command in the system's command line interface. It is particularly tailored for use on Windows platforms, ensuring that the command is interpreted according to Windows' command syntax. \n\nIf there is a need to execute multiple commands sequentially, users should concatenate these commands with the '&&' operator. This operator ensures that the subsequent command will only execute if the preceding command is successful, meaning it returns a zero exit status. This is a crucial feature for script automation where the success of each step depends on the successful completion of the previous one.\n\nHowever, when dealing with more complex tasks that require multiple commands or more advanced logic, it is advisable to create a batch (.bat) file. A batch file is a text file containing a series of commands intended to be executed by the command-line interpreter, which can offer greater flexibility and control compared to running commands directly through `os.system()`. By writing your logic into a .bat file, you can manage intricate script processes more efficiently, including error handling, flow control, and conditional logic, which can be cumbersome or impractical to manage using `os.system()` alone.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the function:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Single command\nos.system('dir')  # Lists directory contents in Windows\n\n# Multiple commands\nos.system('cd C:\\\\ && dir')  # Changes directory and lists contents\n\n# For complex tasks, save commands in a .bat file and execute\nos.system('path_to_your_script\\\\your_script.bat')\n```\n\nIn using `os.system()`, it is also important to note that the function returns the exit status code of the command executed, which can be used to determine if the command was executed successfully or if an error occurred.

The `os.system()` function allows you to run shell commands directly from a Python script as if you were typing them in the command prompt. It is particularly suitable for executing simple system commands and scripts that do not require capturing the output within the Python environment.\n\nWhen you intend to execute multiple commands in succession, you can combine them using the '&&' operator.

The calculation is based on three crucial parameters: the distance traveled by the vehicle in that year, the type of fuel the vehicle uses, and the fuel efficiency of the vehicle.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n1. **Distance Traveled**: This parameter represents the total number of miles or kilometers the vehicle has traveled in a year. It is a critical factor, as greater distances typically result in higher emissions.\n\n2. **Fuel Type**: The type of fuel the vehicle uses significantly impacts the calculation. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, electric, and hybrid options. Each fuel type has a specific carbon emissions factor, which denotes the amount of carbon dioxide produced per unit of fuel consumed. This emissions factor is essential for accurately estimating the vehicle's carbon footprint.\n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency**: This represents how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel, usually expressed in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). Higher fuel efficiency indicates that the vehicle can travel further on a smaller amount of fuel, potentially reducing the total emissions.\n\n**Calculation Process:**\n\nThe function combines these parameters to estimate the annual carbon dioxide emissions. It considers the distance traveled and divides it by the vehicle's fuel efficiency to determine the total fuel consumed over the year. This result is then multiplied by the carbon emissions factor associated with the selected fuel type to calculate the total emissions in terms of carbon dioxide.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n- If the distance traveled is zero, the function should correctly return zero emissions, as no travel means no fuel consumption or emissions.\n- If the fuel efficiency is excessively high, it could result in minimal emissions even for significant travel distances, which should be correctly processed.\n- Different fuel types with different emissions factors must be handled accurately to reflect real-world differences in carbon output.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\nSuppose a vehicle travels 15,000 kilometers in", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"distance": {"type": "integer", "description": "The distance travelled in miles."}, "fuel_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of fuel used by the vehicle."}, "fuel_efficiency": {"type": "float", "description": "The vehicle's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon."}, "efficiency_reduction": {"type": "integer", "description": "The percentage decrease in fuel efficiency per year (optional).

This function leverages available data sources and statistical models to provide an approximation that can assist researchers, conservationists, and policy-makers in understanding the current status of the species in question.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **species_name**: A string representing the common or scientific name of the species for which the population estimate is desired. It is crucial that the name is accurate and corresponds to the recognized nomenclature to ensure the retrieval of relevant data.\n  \n- **country_name**: A string that specifies the name of the country where the population of the species is to be estimated. The country name should match the internationally recognized English spelling to avoid discrepancies in data sourcing.\n\n#### Functionality:\nUpon execution, the function accesses various ecological and environmental databases that track species populations and biodiversity metrics. It applies statistical algorithms that consider factors such as habitat size, known population densities, migration patterns, and any available historical data on population trends and threats, such as habitat loss or climate change impacts. The function may also integrate remote sensing data or citizen science reports to refine its estimates.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- **Data Availability**: In situations where data for a specific species-country combination is sparse or non-existent, the function may return a result with a higher degree of uncertainty. Researchers should be prepared to interpret such outputs with caution.\n  \n- **Species Identification**: Ensuring the correct identification of species is critical. Misidentification can lead to inaccurate estimates and potentially misinform conservation strategies.\n\n- **Country Boundaries**: Political or geographical changes may affect the accuracy of estimates if historical data correspond to different territorial boundaries.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n```python\n# Estimating the population of the African Elephant in Kenya\npopulation_estimate = estimate_species_population(species_name=\"African Elephant\", country_name=\"Kenya\")\nprint(f\"", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"species": {"type": "string", "description": "The species for which population needs to be estimated."}, "country": {"type": "string", "description": "The country where the species lives."}, "year": {"type": "integer", "description": "The year for which population estimate is sought.

By leveraging the powerful search capabilities of Spotify, the function allows users to input a query that can include parts of the song title, artist name, album, or other related metadata. Upon receiving the query, the function initiates a search within Spotify's extensive music library to find the best match or list of matches that correspond to the user's input.\n\nOnce the function identifies the correct song from the search results, it proceeds to play the song through the Spotify platform. The function ensures that the song is played using the user's Spotify account, provided that the account is authenticated and has the necessary permissions to play music through the service.\n\n#### Parameter Explanation\n\n- **query**: The query parameter is a string that represents the search term or terms the user wishes to use to find a song on Spotify. This can be a fragment or complete song title, the artist's name, album name, or a combination thereof. The query should be formulated to maximize the accuracy of the search results.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\nSuppose a user wants to listen to \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by Queen. The user can call the function with the query parameter set to \"Bohemian Rhapsody Queen\" or simply \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" to search for the song. The function will then search Spotify's library, identify the track, and proceed to play it.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n\n- If the query does not correspond to any identifiable song, the function should handle this scenario gracefully, possibly by returning an error message or prompt indicating that no match was found.\n- If multiple songs match the query closely, the function may either play the first result or prompt the user to choose from a list of possible matches.\n- The function requires an active internet connection and a valid Spotify account with streaming permissions to function correctly.

By incorporating all these criteria, the function offers a comprehensive and user-friendly way to discover exhibitions that align with the user's interests and expectations.\n\nIn terms of edge cases, the function is capable of handling scenarios where some criteria might not be applicable or available. For instance, if a user does not specify a location, the function might default to displaying popular exhibitions from a broader geographical range. Similarly, if user ratings are not available for certain exhibitions, the function might rely more heavily on other available metrics like the art form or timing to determine popularity. This flexibility ensures that the function remains robust and effective across a wide range of user queries and data scenarios.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"location": {"type": "string", "description": "The city and state where the exhibition is held, e.g., New York City, NY."}, "art_form": {"type": "string", "description": "The form of art the exhibition is displaying e.g., sculpture."}, "month": {"type": "string", "description": "The month of exhibition.

This function is particularly useful for composers, musicians, and music producers who are looking to craft new pieces of music or explore different harmonic structures within a specific key. The user can define both the key in which the progression should occur and the number of chords to be included in the progression, allowing for a high degree of customization and flexibility to suit various musical styles and needs.\n\nParameters:\n\n- `key` (string): This parameter specifies the musical key in which the chord progression will be created. The key is indicated by a string value, which should correspond to a recognized musical key, such as 'C', 'G', 'D minor', 'E flat major', etc. This parameter determines the tonal center and the set of pitches that the chords will be built upon.\n\n- `numChords` (integer): This parameter dictates the total number of chords to be generated within the progression.

This makes the function robust in handling both standard time and daylight saving time adjustments.\n\nAn edge case to consider is when the conversion falls into a time that does not exist due to the forward clock change during the start of daylight saving time, or a time that occurs twice due to the backward clock change at the end of daylight saving time. The function should handle such scenarios by providing options to specify if the time should be adjusted to the nearest valid time or if an error should be raised.\n\nFor example, suppose the function receives a datetime representing 2:30 AM on March 14, 2023, in the Pacific Standard Time (PST) zone, and the target time zone is Eastern Standard Time (EST). The function will convert this to 5:30 AM on the same date, reflecting the 3-hour difference between PST and EST.
