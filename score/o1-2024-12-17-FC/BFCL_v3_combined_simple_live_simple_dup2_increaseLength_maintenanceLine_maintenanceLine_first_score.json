This calculation is crucial in thermodynamics to understand how energy is dispersed in such a process without any loss due to irreversibility. \n\nIn an isothermal and reversible process, the change in entropy (\u0394S) is determined using the formula \u0394S = Q/T, where Q represents the heat exchanged during the process and T is the absolute temperature at which the process occurs, expressed in Kelvin.

Allows for the bulk recording of query classifications in one function call.This function is designed to facilitate the process of recording classifications for a collection of queries by utilizing intent names that are specified through keyword arguments. It serves as a mechanism to efficiently handle multiple query classifications in a single execution, thereby streamlining the workflow for users who need to manage large datasets or multiple queries simultaneously.\n\nThe primary purpose of this function is to map each query to its corresponding intent classification based on the intent names that are passed as keyword arguments. By allowing keyword arguments, users have the flexibility to specify intent names that accurately describe the purpose or category of each query. This feature enables precise classification and organization of data, which is particularly useful in applications such as natural language processing, user interaction analysis, and automated response systems.\n\nIn practical usage, the function accepts several keyword arguments where each key corresponds to a query, and its value represents the intent name. For example, if you have a series of queries related to customer support interactions, you might use the function to assign intents like \"billing_inquiry\", \"technical_support\", or \"general_feedback\" to each query, thereby tagging them for further processing or analysis.\n\nAn edge case to consider when using this function is ensuring that the intent names provided in the keyword arguments are valid and recognized by the system. Invalid or misspelled intent names may result in misclassification or errors.

This score is a numerical representation that evaluates and indicates the level of certainty or reliability of the retrieved information concerning copyright ownership. \n\nThe confidence score is an important aspect because it helps users understand the degree of trust they can place in the provided data. Such scores are particularly useful in determining the credibility of the information, especially in cases where the copyright data may be ambiguous or uncertain due to multiple claims or lack of clear documentation.\n\n### Usage Example:\nWhen using this function, a user inputs a reference to specific content, such as a digital file or document, for which they are seeking copyright information. The function processes this input and returns two key pieces of information: \n\n1. The **name of the copyright holder**, which is a string identifying the person, organization, or entity that legally holds the copyright to the content. This might include authors, artists, publishers, companies, or other entities.\n\n2. A **confidence score**, typically represented as a percentage or a decimal between 0 and 1, where a higher score indicates greater confidence and accuracy in the provided copyright information. For example, a confidence score of 0.95 or 95% would suggest very high accuracy, whereas a score of 0.5 or 50% might suggest that the information should be verified further for reliability.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- **Ambiguous Ownership**: In situations where content has multiple potential copyright holders, the function should aim to identify the most likely holder or provide multiple names along with their respective confidence scores.\n  \n- **Lack of Data**: If no reliable copyright information is available, the function may return a null or default value for both the holder's name and confidence score, indicating that", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["copyright_content", "copyright_holder", "confidence_score"], "properties": {"copyright_content": {"type": "string", "description": "The specific content that is claimed to be copyrighted."}, "copyright_holder": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the individual or organization that holds the copyright."}, "confidence_score": {"type": "float", "description": "A decimal value representing the confidence score as a percentage, ranging from 0.0 to 100.0."}}}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"get_copyright_info1": "{\n  \"copyright_content\": \"Image containing the Coca-Cola logo\",\n  \"copyright_holder\": \"The Coca-Cola Company\",\n  \"confidence_score\": 100.0\n}"}], "model_result_decoded": [{"get_copyright_info1": {"copyright_content": "Image containing the Coca-Cola logo", "copyright_holder": "The Coca-Cola Company", "confidence_score": 100.0}}], "possible_answer": [{"get_copyright_info1": {"copyright_content": ["Coca-Cola logo"], "copyright_holder": ["The Coca-Cola Company"], "confidence_score": [100.0]}}, {"get_copyright_info2": {"copyright_content": ["Coca-Cola logo"], "copyright_holder": ["The Coca-Cola Company"], "confidence_score": [100.0]}}, {"get_copyright_info3": {"copyright_content": ["Coca-Cola logo"], "copyright_holder": ["The Coca-Cola Company"], "confidence_score": [100.0]}}]}

The calculation is based on three primary factors: the distance the vehicle travels in a year, the type of fuel used by the vehicle, and its fuel efficiency.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n1. **Distance Traveled (annual_distance):** This represents the total distance covered by the vehicle over the course of a year. It is usually measured in miles or kilometers, depending on the preferred unit system. Accurate input of this parameter is crucial as it directly influences the resulting emissions calculation.\n\n2. **Fuel Type (fuel_type):** This denotes the type of fuel the vehicle uses. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, natural gas, and electricity. Different fuels emit varying amounts of CO2 when consumed, and this parameter allows the function to use the appropriate emission factor for the calculation. \n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency (fuel_efficiency):** This is a measure of how effectively a vehicle uses fuel, typically expressed in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). Higher fuel efficiency indicates that the vehicle can travel more distance using less fuel, thus producing fewer emissions for the same distance traveled.\n\n**Calculation Process:**\n\nThe core calculation involves determining the total fuel consumption for the given distance based on the vehicle's fuel efficiency. Once the total fuel consumption is established, the function applies the specific emission factor associated with the fuel type to calculate the total CO2 emissions. The emission factor is a standard value that indicates the amount of CO2 released per unit of fuel consumed.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n- **Extreme Values for Distance:** When calculating emissions for vehicles that travel extremely high or low annual distances, ensure that the inputs remain realistic. For instance, commuting vehicles may have significantly lower distances compared to long-haul trucks.\n\n- **Fuel Efficiency Limits:** Consider edge cases where fuel efficiency is unusually high or", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"distance": {"type": "integer", "description": "The distance travelled in miles."}, "fuel_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of fuel used by the vehicle."}, "fuel_efficiency": {"type": "float", "description": "The vehicle's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon."}, "efficiency_reduction": {"type": "integer", "description": "The percentage decrease in fuel efficiency per year (optional).

This parameter is crucial as it helps narrow down the search to the correct artist, especially in cases where multiple artists may have songs with the same title.\n  \n- **song_title**: A string that specifies the title of the song for which the lyrics are being sought. The accuracy of this parameter is important to ensure the correct lyrics are retrieved, as different songs may share similar or identical titles across various artists.\n\n### Usage Example:\nSuppose a user wishes to find the lyrics for the song \"Imagine\" by John Lennon. They would call this function with the `artist_name` parameter set to \"John Lennon\" and the `song_title` parameter set to \"Imagine\". The function would then process these inputs, search the lyrics database, and return the full lyrics of the song \"Imagine\" sung by John Lennon.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- **Case Sensitivity**: Depending on the implementation, the search for the artist's name and song title may be case-sensitive. It is advisable to standardize the input strings by converting them to a uniform case, such as lowercase, to ensure successful retrieval.\n  \n- **Multiple Versions**: Some songs might have multiple versions, for example, live performances or remixes. The function needs to clearly specify which version is being retrieved, or it should default to the most widely recognized version if multiple versions exist.\n\n- **Special Characters**: Artist names or song titles with special characters, such as accents or punctuation marks, should be handled appropriately to prevent search errors. Normalizing these characters before performing the lookup can improve", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"song_title": {"type": "string", "description": "The title of the song."}, "artist_name": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the artist who performed the song."}, "lang": {"type": "string", "description": "The language of the lyrics.
