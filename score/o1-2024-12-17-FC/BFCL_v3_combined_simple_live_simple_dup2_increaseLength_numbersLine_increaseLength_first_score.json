Prime factors are the set of prime numbers that multiply together to represent the original number. The function systematically breaks down the input number into its constituent prime components.\n\n#### Parameters\n- **number (int)**: A positive integer for which the function will determine the prime factors. The input should be greater than 1, as numbers less than 2 do not have prime factors.\n\n#### Returns\n- **List[int]**: A list containing the prime factors of the provided number. Each prime factor appears in the list as many times as it is used in the multiplication to achieve the original number. The list is sorted in ascending order.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n- If the input number is a prime number itself, the function will return a list containing just that number, as a prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.\n- The smallest prime factor for any positive integer greater than 1 is 2. If the input is an even number, the function will first divide by 2 repeatedly until it becomes odd.\n- For negative numbers or non-integer input, the function should raise an exception or handle the error gracefully, as prime factorization is defined only for positive integers.\n\n#### Usage Example\n```python\n# Example 1: Prime factors of 28\n# 28 can be expressed as 2 * 2 * 7\nprime_factors(28)\n# Output: [2, 2, 7]\n\n# Example 2: Prime factors of a prime number like 13\nprime_factors(13)\n# Output: [13]\n\n# Example 3: Prime factors of 100\n# 100 can be expressed as 2 * 2 * 5 * 5\nprime_factors(100)\n# Output: [2, 2, 5, 5]\n```\n\n####", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"number": {"type": "integer", "description": "Number for which prime factors need to be calculated"}, "formatted": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Return formatted string if true, array if false.

The entropy change is a measure of the disorder or randomness in the system, and this function provides a quantitative assessment of that alteration.\n\nIn order to perform the calculation, the function requires precise input parameters that define the initial and final states of the substance.

An isothermal process is characterized by maintaining a constant temperature throughout the process, meaning that any heat exchange with the surroundings does not result in a change in temperature of the system. A reversible process is an idealized or hypothetical process that occurs in such a way that the system and its surroundings can be returned to their initial states by exactly reversing the process without any increase in entropy.\n\nIn thermodynamics, entropy is a measure of the amount of energy in a physical system that is not available to do work, often associated with the degree of disorder or randomness in the system. The change in entropy, denoted as \u0394S, during a reversible process can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\u0394S = Q_rev / T,\n\nwhere Q_rev is the amount of reversible heat exchange (in joules) and T is the absolute temperature (in Kelvin) at which the process occurs. Since the process is isothermal, the temperature remains constant, simplifying the calculation of entropy change.\n\nThis function is particularly useful in theoretical physics and engineering contexts where understanding the flow of energy and the efficiency of processes is crucial. It is important to note that this calculation assumes ideal conditions and may not accurately predict entropy changes in real-world, irreversible processes due to additional factors like friction, turbulence, or non-ideal material behavior.\n\nExample Usage:\n- To calculate the entropy change for a gas expanding reversibly and isothermally when it absorbs 1000 J of heat at a constant temperature of 300 K, you can use the formula as follows: \u0394S = 1000 / 300 = 3.33 J/K.

The function plays a crucial role in maintaining an organized system of query classifications, which can be instrumental for further processing, reporting, and fulfilling banking operational requirements.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **query_id**: A unique identifier for each query that is to be recorded. This ensures that each query can be distinctly recognized and tracked.\n- **query_content**: The actual content or body of the query. This is the text or message that describes the banking-related issue or request.\n- **category**: A predefined list or system of categories under which the query will be classified. Categories might include loan inquiries, transaction disputes, account management, fraud alerts, etc.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- The function should handle scenarios where a query does not clearly fit into any defined category, potentially by assigning it to a default or miscellaneous category or flagging it for manual review.\n- It must also address queries that could belong to multiple categories by applying predefined rules for prioritization or categorization to ensure consistency.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nTo illustrate the function's application, consider a scenario where a customer submits a query about a potential credit card fraud.

It provides the capability to run a single command or multiple commands that are chained together using the '&&' operator, which is a common practice in command-line operations to ensure that subsequent commands are only executed if the previous one completes successfully. \n\nThe `os.system()` function takes a single string argument, which should contain the command or set of commands you wish to execute.

The '&&' operator ensures that each command is executed sequentially, with the next command only running if the previous command finishes with a success (exit status 0). This is particularly useful for tasks that depend on the successful execution of previous commands.\n\nHere is a usage example: \n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Executes a single command\nos.system('echo Hello, World!')\n\n# Executes multiple commands chained with '&&'\nos.system('cd C:\\\\MyDirectory && dir && echo Done')\n```\n\nIn this example, first, a single command is executed, which simply outputs \"Hello, World!\" to the console.

This functionality is pivotal when you require your Python script to interact directly with the operating system's command line interface. The `os.system()` call allows a Python script to execute a command as if it were typed directly into the Command Prompt.\n\nFor executing the command, you simply need to pass the desired system command as a string argument to the `os.system()` function. This can include a single command or multiple commands that are chained together using the '&&' operator. The '&&' operator ensures that commands are executed sequentially, where the subsequent command will only run if the previous one completes successfully (i.e., returns a zero exit status). This is particularly useful for executing a series of dependent commands where the successful execution of the first command is necessary for the execution of the next.\n\nFor example, to execute a single command, you might use:\n```python\nos.system('dir')\n```\nThis would invoke the `dir` command, listing the contents of the current directory in the Command Prompt.\n\nTo execute multiple commands, you could use:\n```python\nos.system('cd \\\\ && mkdir new_folder')\n```\nIn this example, the script first navigates to the root directory using `cd \\\\` and then creates a new folder named `new_folder` using `mkdir new_folder`. If the first command fails, the second command will not execute, thanks to the '&&' chaining.\n\nThis function is limited to the Windows operating system and relies on the capabilities and available commands of the Windows Command Prompt environment. It's important to note that while `os.system()` is a straightforward way to invoke system commands from within a Python script, it does not provide access to more advanced features such as capturing the output of the command.

This means that if the first command fails, any commands following the '&&' will not be executed. \n\nFor example, if you wanted to first create a directory and then navigate into it, you could use a command string like `mkdir new_folder && cd new_folder`. Here, `mkdir new_folder` will create the directory, and if successful, the command `cd new_folder` will change the current directory to `new_folder`.\n\nWhen using this function, it is important to consider the security implications of executing system commands, especially if any part of the command string is constructed based on user input.

The `os.system()` function allows users to issue commands to the underlying operating system, facilitating tasks such as running executables, managing files and directories, or querying system information directly from a Python script.\n\nThe function is capable of executing not just a single command, but also multiple commands that are chained together.

This function call is specifically intended for use within Windows operating systems. When using this function, you can execute a single command directly by passing it as a string argument. In scenarios where you need to execute multiple commands in sequence, you should separate each command with the '&&' operator.

This parameter specifies the exact day for which you wish to obtain the weather data, allowing you to plan activities based on predicted weather conditions.\n\nThe function will typically return a comprehensive weather report, which may include temperature highs and lows, precipitation chances, wind speed, humidity levels, and other relevant meteorological information. The forecast is useful for individuals planning travel, events, or simply wanting to stay informed about upcoming weather conditions.\n\nIt is important to note that the accuracy of the forecast might vary based on the source of the weather data and the inherent unpredictability of weather patterns. Users should consider checking forecasts closer to the desired date for more precise information.\n\nExample usage of this function could look like this: `getWeatherForecast(\"New York\", \"2023-12-25\")`, which would provide the weather forecast for New York City on December 25th, 2023.

When using this function, the user must provide two essential parameters: the 'key' and the 'number of chords'. \n\nThe 'key' parameter is a string that indicates the musical key in which the chord progression will be composed. This key can represent both major and minor tonalities, allowing for versatile musical creation. For example, the key could be 'C Major', 'A Minor', or any other key from the chromatic scale.\n\nThe 'number of chords' parameter is an integer value that specifies how many chords will be included in the progression. This allows the user to tailor the length and complexity of the progression according to their needs. For instance, a common pop song might use a progression of four chords, while a more intricate piece could involve eight or more chords.\n\nThe function ensures that the chords generated are harmonically compatible with the specified key. Therefore, it selects chords that naturally occur within the given key's scale. For example, if the key is 'C Major', the chords generated might include C major, D minor, E minor, F major, G major, A minor, and B diminished.\n\nHere's an example of how the function might be used:\n\nExample:\n```python\nchord_progression = create_chord_progression(key='G Major', number_of_chords=4)\n```\n\nIn this example, the function will generate a chord progression in the key of G Major consisting of four chords.

This function is particularly useful for musicians, composers, and music theorists who need to understand harmonic structures or create chord progressions. \n\nWhen you provide the function with a key, it analyzes the notes that comprise that key's scale. The function then identifies the third chord, counting from the tonic, which is constructed using the major scale pattern. It\u2019s important to note that in Western music theory, a major chord is typically built using the first (root), third, and fifth notes of the scale. This function specifically targets the third position major chord within the sequence of triads that can be derived from the given key.\n\nFor instance, if the given key is C major, the function will calculate the third major chord in this key. In the C major scale (C, D, E, F, G, A, B), the third chord is E minor when considering the diatonic triads, but if the focus is solely on major chords, it will identify the next major chord after C major and G major, which does not exist in the basic major scale triads of C major.\n\nIn terms of usage, the function typically requires input specifying the desired key. This key can be represented in various forms, such as a string indicating the key signature (e.g., \"C major\" or \"G# major\"). The result is the name of the major chord that is third in the sequence of major chords possible in that key, or an indication that only two major chords are typically present within a diatonic major scale before repeating the cycle.\n\nThis function is highly relevant in music education and the development of software applications that analyze or generate music.

When invoked, it accurately computes and returns the time based on the specified time zone input. The function is particularly useful for applications that require time zone awareness, such as scheduling systems, internationalization features, or applications that display time-sensitive information to users across different geographical regions.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **time_zone**: A string that specifies the desired time zone. The input must correspond to a valid time zone identifier based on the IANA time zone database. Examples include \"America/New_York\", \"Europe/London\", or \"Asia/Tokyo\". It is important to ensure the correctness of this parameter as invalid inputs may lead to errors or exceptions being raised.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\nUpon receiving a valid time zone identifier, the function performs the following actions:\n\n1. Validates the provided time zone to ensure it matches an entry in the IANA time zone database.\n2. Retrieves the current time from the system clock or an external time service.\n3. Adjusts the retrieved time according to the rules of the specified time zone, taking into account any applicable daylight saving time adjustments or historical changes to time zone definitions.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Invalid Time Zone**: If an invalid or unrecognized time zone identifier is provided, the function may throw an exception or return an error message indicating the issue. The user should handle such cases to ensure smooth functionality.\n- **Daylight Saving Time**: The function considers daylight saving time transitions automatically, ensuring that the returned time is accurate even during these periods.\n- **Time Zone Changes**: Any changes to time zone definitions, such as shifts in borders or policy changes by governments, are automatically handled based on the latest IANA time zone database updates.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\n```python\n# Example usage in Python\ncurrent_time = get_current_time_in_timezone(\"America", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"location": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the city."}, "country": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the country."}, "timezone": {"type": "string", "description": "The optional timezone to get current time.
