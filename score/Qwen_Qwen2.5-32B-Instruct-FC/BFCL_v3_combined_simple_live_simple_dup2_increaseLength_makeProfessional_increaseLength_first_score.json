It takes an input that specifies the food item the customer desires to select. The critical aspect of this function is its adherence to a specific requirement: the name of the food item provided by the customer must be in uppercase letters. This ensures consistency and prevents errors that could arise from case sensitivity in processing food item names.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\n- **Input Requirement:** The function expects the food item name to be passed as a string. It is crucial that this string is entirely in uppercase letters. For example, if a customer wants to select \"pasta,\" the input should be \"PASTA\" instead of \"pasta\" or \"Pasta.\" This requirement is in place to maintain uniformity in how food items are recorded and processed within the system.\n\n- **Selection Process:** Upon receiving the request, the function checks the provided food name against a predefined list of available food items. It confirms that the requested food item exists in the list and then updates the current selection to reflect the customer's choice. The function will only successfully execute if the food name matches an item in the list exactly, taking into account the uppercase requirement.\n\n- **Error Handling:** If the food name is not supplied in uppercase or does not match any item in the available food list, the function will not proceed with changing the selection. Instead, it will typically return an error message or code indicating the nature of the issue, such as \"Invalid food item name\" or \"Food item not found.\" This helps guide users to correct the input and resubmit their requests appropriately.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose a customer wants to change their selection to a salad. The function call should look like this:\n\n```plaintext\nchangeFoodSelection(\"SALAD\")\n```\n\nIn this scenario, \"SALAD\" is the correct input because it adheres to the uppercase requirement.

It is crucial for the input to accurately match the recognized scientific or common name of the substance to ensure correct retrieval of data. For example, if you are interested in water, you would pass \"water\" as the argument.\n- **sea_level**: While the sea-level condition is typically implied, it is crucial to note that the boiling and melting points provided by this function are calibrated to standard atmospheric pressure found at sea level, which is approximately 101.3 kPa (kilopascals). This condition is important because atmospheric pressure can influence the boiling and melting points of substances.\n\n### Output\nThe function outputs two key values:\n1. **Boiling Point**: This is the temperature at which the substance transitions from a liquid to a gas at sea-level atmospheric pressure. For example, water boils at 100\u00b0C (212\u00b0F) under these conditions.\n2. **Melting Point**: This temperature marks the transition of the substance from a solid to a liquid, again assuming sea-level atmospheric pressure. For instance, the melting point of ice, which is solid water, is 0\u00b0C (32\u00b0F).\n\n### Usage Example\nConsider a scenario where you need to determine the thermal properties of ethanol for an experiment. You would call the function as follows:\n```python\nboiling_point, melting_point = get_thermal_properties(\"ethanol\")\n```\nUpon execution, this function call will return the boiling point and melting point of ethanol under standard sea-level atmospheric pressure.\n\n### Edge Cases\n- If an unrecognized substance name is provided, the function may return null values", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"substance": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the substance."}, "sea_level": {"type": "integer", "description": "The sea level in meters."}}, "required": ["substance", "sea_level"]}}, {"name": "get_boiling_melting_points2", "description": "Retrieve the boiling point and melting point of a substance based on its name and the sea level.This function retrieves the boiling point and melting point of a specified substance, taking into account the provided sea level.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"substance": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the substance."}, "sea_level": {"type": "integer", "description": "The sea level in meters."}}, "required": ["substance", "sea_level"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"get_boiling_melting_points1": {"substance_name": "water", "sea_level": 5000}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"get_boiling_melting_points1": {"substance_name": "water", "sea_level": 5000}}], "possible_answer": [{"get_boiling_melting_points1": {"substance": ["water"], "sea_level": [5000]}}, {"get_boiling_melting_points2": {"substance": ["water"], "sea_level": [5000]}}, {"get_boiling_melting_points3": {"substance": ["water"], "sea_level": [5000]}}]}

Such processes are fundamental concepts in thermodynamics, often used in the analysis of idealized systems.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **Q**: The heat exchanged during the process, typically measured in joules (J). This parameter is crucial since, for an isothermal process, the entropy change is directly related to the heat transfer.\n- **T**: The absolute temperature at which the process occurs, measured in Kelvin (K). The temperature must remain constant throughout the process for the calculations to be valid. It is critical to ensure the temperature is given in Kelvin, as this is the standard unit in thermodynamics calculations.\n\n#### Details:\nIn the context of an isothermal and reversible process, the change in entropy (\\(\\Delta S\\)) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta S = \\frac{Q}{T}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\Delta S\\) is the change in entropy,\n- \\(Q\\) is the heat absorbed by the system,\n- \\(T\\) is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe function assumes that the process is carried out reversibly, which implies that the system remains in thermodynamic equilibrium throughout the process. This is an idealization that allows for the calculation of entropy changes without additional entropy generation, which would occur in irreversible processes.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- **Zero Heat Exchange**: If \\(Q = 0\\), the entropy change \\(\\Delta S\\) will be zero, indicating no change in the system's disorder.\n- **Negative Heat Exchange**: If the system releases heat (i.e., \\(Q\\) is negative), the entropy change will be negative, signifying a decrease in the system's entropy.\n\n#### Example Usage:\nImagine a scenario where a system absorbs 500 J of heat at a constant temperature of", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"initial_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial temperature in Kelvin."}, "final_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The final temperature in Kelvin."}, "heat_capacity": {"type": "integer", "description": "The heat capacity in J/K."}, "isothermal": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether the process is isothermal.

To achieve this, the function takes into account three critical parameters: the initial starting number of bacteria, the frequency with which the bacteria duplicate, and the total duration over which the evolution is measured.\n\n1. **Starting Number**: This parameter represents the initial count of bacteria present at the beginning of the observation period. It is crucial for establishing the baseline from which the population growth is measured.\n\n2. **Duplication Frequency**: This parameter specifies how often the bacteria population doubles in number. It is a measure of the replication speed of the bacteria and is typically expressed in terms of time, such as every hour or every 30 minutes. Understanding this frequency is essential for predicting how quickly the population will grow over the given duration.\n\n3. **Total Duration**: This parameter defines the overall time span during which the bacterial population's evolution is being calculated. It is an essential factor as it determines the number of duplication cycles that occur and thus the final population size at the end of the period.\n\nBy combining these parameters, the function computes the evolution rate, which is essentially the growth rate of the bacterial population over the specified time frame. This calculation allows users to understand how rapidly the bacteria evolve under certain conditions. For example, if you start with 100 bacteria that duplicate every 2 hours over a 10-hour period, the function can calculate how many bacteria will be present at the end of the 10 hours.\n\nThe function assumes ideal conditions for bacterial growth, meaning it does not account for factors such as resource limitation, environmental changes, or other biological constraints that might affect the actual growth rate in a real-world scenario.

The behavior of the function varies depending on the data type of the input, as it handles strings, booleans, and numbers differently, each in a manner appropriate to its type.\n\nWhen the input is a string, the function processes the input by reversing the order of the characters within the string.

It is important to note that this operation only changes the order of characters, so the characters themselves remain unchanged.\n\nIn the case of a boolean input, the function returns the logical negation of the boolean value. For instance, if the input is `true`, the output will be `false`, and conversely, if the input is `false`, the output will be `true`. This operation effectively inverts the truth value of the boolean.\n\nFor numerical inputs, the function returns the negative value of the number. This means that if a positive number is provided as input, the function will return its negative counterpart. For example, an input of 5 will result in an output of -5. Similarly, if the input is a negative number, the function will return the positive version of that number, such as converting -3 to 3.

It is typically provided as a decimal, where a 5% return would be input as 0.05. The yield rate is crucial as it directly influences the growth of the investment over time.\n\n2. **Investment Amount**: This is the initial sum of money that is invested in the mutual fund. It represents the principal amount upon which the returns will be calculated. The investment amount is essential for determining the scale of the potential returns, with larger investments leading to proportionately higher estimated returns, assuming the same yield rate and time period.\n\n3. **Time Period**: This parameter specifies the duration, usually in years, for which the investment is held in the mutual fund. The time period impacts the compounding effect, where longer durations typically result in greater overall returns due to the exponential growth facilitated by compounding interest.\n\nThe calculation process assumes the concept of compound interest, where the returns are reinvested and generate their own returns over time. This means that each year, the mutual fund's yield is applied not only to the original investment amount but also to the accumulated returns from previous years.\n\nFor example, if an investor puts $10,000 into a mutual fund with an annual yield of 7% for 5 years, the function will estimate the future value of this investment by applying the compound interest formula. It multiplies the original investment by the compound factor, which is calculated using the formula \\( (1 + \\text{yearly yield})^{\\text{time period}} \\).

This chaining ensures that the subsequent command will only be executed if the preceding command succeeds, that is, returns an exit status of zero. This feature is particularly useful for scripting and automating sequences of operations where the successful completion of one command is a prerequisite for the next.\n\nFor example, to update a system and then clean up temporary files only if the update was successful, you might use a command string such as \"update_command && cleanup_command\". This ensures that cleanup is only attempted if \"update_command\" executes successfully.\n\nIt's important to note that this function operates synchronously.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.This function is designed to execute system-level commands specifically on Windows operating systems by utilizing the `os.system()` method from Python's `os` module. The `os.system()` function is a straightforward way to interface with the underlying operating system to run shell commands from within a Python script. This function is capable of executing a single command or multiple commands that are chained together using the '&&' operator. The use of '&&' ensures that the commands are executed sequentially, meaning that each command is only executed if the preceding command is successful (i.e., it returns an exit status of zero). This is particularly useful for constructing command sequences where each step depends on the successful completion of the previous step.\n\nWhen using this function, it is important to be aware of the return value of `os.system()`, which is the exit status of the executed command. A zero return value typically indicates that the command was executed successfully, while a non-zero value signifies an error. Additionally, since `os.system()` starts a new shell to execute the command, any environment variables or changes to the current directory will not affect the current Python script's environment after the function call completes.\n\nHere's a simple usage example:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Execute a single command\nos.system(\"echo Hello, World!\")\n\n# Execute multiple commands chained with '&&'\nos.system(\"cd C:\\\\ && dir\")\n```\n\nIn the first example, the command `echo Hello, World!` is executed, which simply outputs the string \"Hello, World!\" to the console. In the second example, two commands are executed in sequence: changing the current directory to the root of the C drive (`cd C:\\\\`) and then listing the directory contents using the `dir` command. Note that if the `cd` command were to fail for some reason, the `dir` command would not execute due to the use of '&&'.

This means that when you request an exchange rate, the function not only provides the base rate at which the two currencies can be exchanged but also adjusts this rate to include any additional costs that would be incurred due to transaction fees. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where the fee is a percentage of the transaction amount, as it allows users to understand the effective rate they will receive.\n\n### Parameters:\n- **currency_from (str):** The code for the currency you are exchanging from. This should be provided in a standard format, typically a three-letter ISO 4217 currency code (e.g., 'USD' for United States Dollar, 'EUR' for Euro).\n- **currency_to (str):** The code for the currency you are exchanging to. Similar to `currency_from`, this should also be a three-letter ISO 4217 currency code.\n\n### Returns:\n- **effective_exchange_rate (float):** The function returns the effective exchange rate as a float. This value represents the rate at which the `currency_from` can be exchanged to the `currency_to`, adjusted for any transaction fees. This allows you to understand the net rate you would receive or pay after accounting for additional charges.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- If either of the currency codes provided is invalid or not supported, the function should handle this gracefully, potentially returning an error message or a special value indicating that the rate cannot be retrieved.\n- In cases where there is no transaction fee, the function should still be able to return the base exchange rate accurately, allowing users to make decisions based solely on the current market conditions without additional charges.\n\n### Usage Example:\nSuppose you want to exchange US Dollars (USD) to Euros (EUR) and there is a transaction fee involved. By calling this function with `currency_from` set to 'USD' and `currency_to` set to 'EUR', you will get back the", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"base_currency": {"type": "string", "description": "The base currency."}, "target_currency": {"type": "string", "description": "The target currency."}, "fee": {"type": "float", "description": "The transaction fee in percentage.
