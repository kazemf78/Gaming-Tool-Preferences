It requires the user to specify the restaurant from which they wish to order as well as the specific food items they intend to purchase, along with the corresponding quantities for each item. \n\n#### Parameters:\n- **Restaurant Selection**: The user must provide the name or unique identifier of the restaurant from which they want to order. This ensures that the function targets the correct establishment on the Uber Eats platform, thereby accessing the menu specific to that restaurant.\n  \n- **Items and Quantities**: The user should specify the exact menu items they wish to order. Alongside each item, the user must indicate the desired quantity. This involves creating a list or dictionary structure where each entry contains a menu item as the key and the quantity as the value, allowing for precise order customization.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nSuppose a user wants to order from the restaurant \"Joe's Burger Shack.\" They decide to order two cheeseburgers and one side of fries. The function call might look like this:\n\n```python\nplace_order(restaurant=\"Joe's Burger Shack\", items={\"Cheeseburger\": 2, \"Fries\": 1})\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The `restaurant` parameter is set to \"Joe's Burger Shack\".\n- The `items` parameter is a dictionary with keys representing menu items (\"Cheeseburger\" and \"Fries\") and values indicating the quantities (2 and 1, respectively).\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- **Invalid Restaurant Name/Identifier**: If the provided restaurant name or identifier does not match any current listings on Uber Eats, the function should handle this gracefully by notifying the user of the error and possibly suggesting alternative options.\n  \n- **Unavailable Items or Incorrect Quantities**: If a specified item is not available in the chosen restaurant's menu or if the quantity is not feasible (e.g.,", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["restaurant", "items", "quantities"], "properties": {"restaurant": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the restaurant from which to order food."}, "items": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of food item names selected for the order."}, "quantities": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "integer"}, "description": "A list of quantities for each food item, corresponding by index to the items array."}}}}, {"name": "uber.eat.order2", "description": "Place an order for food delivery on Uber Eats by specifying the restaurant and the items with their respective quantities.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["restaurant", "items", "quantities"], "properties": {"restaurant": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the restaurant from which to order food."}, "items": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of food item names selected for the order."}, "quantities": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "integer"}, "description": "A list of quantities for each food item, corresponding by index to the items array."}}}}]}, "model_result_raw": "It seems there's a misunderstanding here.

The function ensures that no multiple values or commands can be bundled together in a single execution, thereby maintaining a strict one-to-one correspondence between a call and a command. \n\nThis feature is particularly useful when interacting with devices that require precise and isolated commands, ensuring that each action is deliberate and distinct from others.

It prepares data for machine learning models, ensuring numerical values are scaled properly and categorical variables are appropriately transformed.This function is designed to preprocess the input data, a crucial step in preparing the dataset for machine learning models. The preprocessing involves two primary operations: normalization and encoding of categorical variables. \n\nFirstly, normalization is applied to the numerical values within the dataset. This process adjusts the scale of the numerical data so that it fits within a specific range, usually between 0 and 1, or sometimes between -1 and 1. By scaling the numerical values appropriately, normalization ensures that no individual feature dominates the learning process due to its scale, thereby aiding in the convergence of optimization algorithms and improving the model's performance.\n\nSecondly, the function handles categorical variables by encoding them into a numerical format. Categorical encoding is essential because machine learning algorithms typically require numeric input, and encoding transforms these non-numeric categorical variables into a suitable numerical representation. Common encoding techniques include one-hot encoding, which creates binary columns for each category, and label encoding, which assigns an integer to each category. The choice of encoding technique depends on the specific requirements of the model and the nature of the categorical data.\n\nBy executing these preprocessing steps, the function ensures that the data is in a consistent and model-friendly format. This preparation is critical for the success of machine learning models, as it prevents issues related to varying data scales and non-numeric input. Proper scaling of numerical features helps maintain balance and consistency, while encoding categorical variables allows the model to interpret and utilize these features effectively.

It serves as a tool for organizing and categorizing customer interactions based on predefined classification criteria or categories, enabling better handling and analysis of customer service data.\n\n#### Functionality\n- **Purpose**: The primary goal of this function is to ensure that each customer query is associated with an appropriate classification. This process is crucial for maintaining an organized database of customer interactions, facilitating efficient query handling, and enabling data-driven insights into customer service performance.\n\n- **Input**: The function typically takes specific parameters that include the details of the customer service query. This can include information such as the query ID, customer details, and the classification category, which may be predetermined by an automated system or a customer service agent.\n\n- **Process**: Upon receiving the necessary input parameters, the function records the classification in a centralized system. This might involve updating a database or a CRM system with the classification details, ensuring that the query is stored under the correct category.\n\n- **Output**: The function does not necessarily return a value but ensures that the classification is stored correctly. Success or failure in recording the classification might be logged or signaled through a status message or a boolean indicator.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n- **Invalid Classification**: If a query is attempted to be classified into a category that does not exist or is invalid, the function should handle this gracefully, possibly by returning an error message or logging the incident for further investigation.\n\n- **Duplicate Queries**: In cases where the same customer query is attempted to be classified multiple times, the function should check for duplicates to prevent redundant data entries.\n\n- **Data Integrity**: The function must ensure the integrity and accuracy of the classification data, avoiding situations where queries are misclassified due to incorrect input parameters.\n\n#### Usage Example\nConsider a scenario where a customer service department receives a query related to billing issues.

The primary purpose of this function is to ensure that each query is systematically placed into a specific category that matches its intent. The intent names act as identifiers that help group the queries into relevant categories for easier retrieval and analysis.\n\nWhen using this function, you will pass the queries as keyword arguments, with each keyword representing an intent name and its corresponding value being the query that matches that intent. The function then processes each keyword argument, extracting the intent name and associating it with the provided query. By doing so, it effectively creates a mapping of queries to their respective intent categories.\n\nFor instance, if you have queries related to booking a flight, checking the weather, and setting an alarm, you would pass these queries with intent names like `book_flight`, `check_weather`, and `set_alarm`. The function would then categorize each query under these intent names, ensuring that all queries with the same intent are grouped together. This categorization aids in the organization of queries, making it easier to perform subsequent operations such as analysis or retrieval based on specific intents.\n\nThis functionality is particularly useful in applications involving natural language processing, where understanding the intent behind user queries is crucial.

It should be a string input that precisely matches the registered company name of the customer in the database. It serves as the key identifier for the search operation, enabling the function to locate and compile all the associated tickets.\n\n#### Output\n\n- **List of Tickets:** The function returns a list containing all the tickets that are tied to the specified company. Each ticket in the list includes detailed information such as the ticket ID, date of issue, status, description of the issue, and any other relevant data that can assist in understanding and resolving the customer's request.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n\n- **Non-Existent Company Name:** If the company name provided does not exist in the system's database, the function will return an empty list, indicating that there are no tickets associated with such a company name.\n  \n- **Multiple Companies with Similar Names:** In situations where there are companies with similar names, the function relies on the exact match of the provided string to ensure accurate retrieval. It is critical for the user to input the exact company name to avoid fetching incorrect or incomplete ticket data.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\nSuppose a customer service representative wants to view all tickets for a company named \"Tech Innovators.\" They would call the function providing \"Tech Innovators\" as the company name.

The initial investment amount is then subtracted from the sum of these discounted cash flows. A positive NPV indicates that the projected earnings, in present dollars, exceed the anticipated costs, thereby suggesting that the investment might be profitable. Conversely, a negative NPV suggests that the investment may result in a loss.\n\n### Parameters:\n- **Future Cash Flows**: This is an array or list of expected cash inflows from the investment over time.

This URL might point to a web page, an API endpoint, or any other resource accessible over the internet via HTTP or HTTPS protocols.\n\nOnce the GET request is dispatched, the server hosting the URL processes the request. If the request is successful, the server responds with the requested data, which could be in various formats such as JSON, XML, HTML, or plain text, depending on the endpoint specifications.\n\nSeveral scenarios can affect the outcome of the GET request. A successful data retrieval is typically indicated by a status code of 200 (OK) in the HTTP response. However, if the URL is malformed, unreachable, or if there is a network issue, the function could encounter errors, such as a 404 (Not Found) if the resource does not exist, a 500 (Internal Server Error) indicating a problem on the server side, or a timeout error if the server takes too long to respond.\n\nFurthermore, this function does not alter the state of the server, as GET requests are idempotent and meant solely for data retrieval.

It is capable of executing both single commands as well as multiple commands. When dealing with multiple commands, they can be chained together using the '&&' operator. The '&&' operator ensures that each command is executed sequentially, with the subsequent command running only if the preceding command completes successfully.\n\nFor instance, suppose you want to navigate to a directory and then list its contents; you might use the command string `'cd path\\to\\directory && dir'`.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.The function is designed to execute system-level commands specifically within the context of Windows operating systems, utilizing the `os.system()` method provided by Python's standard library. This method enables interaction with the underlying operating system by sending commands directly to the system shell, allowing for a wide range of operations such as file manipulation, program execution, or system configuration changes.\n\nOne key feature of this function is its ability to execute not just a single command, but also multiple commands in sequence. This is achieved through the use of '&&', a logical operator that allows commands to be chained together. When commands are chained using '&&', each command is executed only if the preceding command was successful, i.e., it returned a zero exit status. This ensures that subsequent commands are only executed if previous commands have not encountered any errors, providing a simple error handling mechanism.\n\nFor example, if you need to change directories and then list files within that directory, you could use the function to execute a command string like \"cd C:\\ExampleDirectory && dir\". If the directory change is successful, the directory listing will proceed; otherwise, if the 'cd' command fails, the 'dir' command will not execute.\n\nIt is important to note that since this function relies on the `os.system()` call, it inherits certain limitations and behaviors of this method. For instance, `os.system()` is a blocking call, meaning that the program will wait until the command has completed execution before proceeding. Additionally, it returns the exit status of the command executed, where a return value of zero typically indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates an error.\n\nFurthermore, because it interacts with the system shell, any command passed to this function must be formatted correctly according to shell syntax and must be something that the system shell can interpret and execute. This includes considerations for command-line syntax, escaping special characters, and ensuring that any paths or filenames are correctly specified.\n\nIn summary, this function provides a straightforward mechanism for executing system commands on Windows platforms", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

This calculation is essential for understanding the environmental impact of a vehicle's operation over the course of a year. The function takes into account three primary factors to determine these emissions: the distance traveled by the vehicle, the type of fuel that the vehicle uses, and the fuel efficiency of the vehicle.\n\n1. **Distance Traveled**: This parameter represents the total number of miles or kilometers that the vehicle covers in a year. It is a crucial factor because the more a vehicle is driven, the more fuel it consumes, and consequently, the more emissions it produces.\n\n2. **Fuel Type**: The type of fuel used by the vehicle plays a significant role in the calculation. Different fuels have varying carbon content and therefore produce different amounts of carbon dioxide when burned. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, and alternative fuels like natural gas or electricity. Each of these fuels has a specific carbon dioxide emission factor, which is used in the calculation to ensure accurate results.\n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency**: Also known as fuel economy, this parameter measures how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel to cover a distance. It is typically expressed in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). A vehicle with higher fuel efficiency will consume less fuel over the same distance compared to a less efficient vehicle, thereby producing fewer emissions.\n\nThe function combines these parameters in a formula to determine the total annual carbon dioxide emissions for the vehicle. It is important to input accurate values for each parameter to ensure the validity of the calculation. This information can be beneficial for vehicle owners seeking to reduce their carbon footprint by understanding the emissions associated with their driving habits and vehicle characteristics.\n\n**Example Usage**:\n- A user can input the following: a vehicle that travels 15,000 miles annually, runs on gasoline, and has a fuel efficiency of 25 MPG.

The number of chords parameter determines how many individual chords will make up the progression, thereby controlling the complexity and duration of the sequence.\n\nThis function is versatile and can be used in various musical contexts, from simple three-chord progressions typical in many pop songs to more complex sequences that might be used in jazz or classical compositions. It is essential to ensure that input parameters are valid; the key should correspond to a recognized musical key (such as C major, A minor, etc.), and the number of chords should be a positive integer. Incorrect input could result in an inability to generate a meaningful progression or lead to unexpected results.\n\nAn example of usage could be calling the function with parameters set to 'C major' for the key and '4' for the number of chords, resulting in a progression suitable for a wide range of musical genres. This function is particularly useful for musicians, composers, and producers looking to automate or experiment with chord progressions in their projects.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"key": {"type": "string", "description": "The key for the chord progression."}, "chords": {"type": "integer", "description": "Number of chords in the progression."}, "progression_type": {"type": "string", "description": "The type of the chord progression.

The function analyzes the cards held by each player, identifies the best possible hand each player can make, and then compares these hands against each other to decide which is the strongest according to the rules of Poker.\n\nWhen multiple players have hands of the same rank, the function further evaluates their hands by comparing the values of the individual cards that make up the hand. For example, if two players both have a flush, the player with the highest card in their flush wins. If necessary, the comparison continues to the second-highest card, third-highest, and so on, until a winner is determined or a tie is declared.\n\nThe function handles edge cases, such as ties between players, by considering detailed Poker rules, including kicker cards or splitting the pot when players have identical hands.

It's important to ensure that the start date is earlier than the end date to avoid any errors or invalid booking requests. The function may include sanity checks to verify the availability of rooms during the requested period and handle any conflicts by providing appropriate feedback to the user.\n\nFor example, if a user wishes to book a hotel room from September 1st, 2023, to September 5th, 2023, the function will check the hotel's inventory for these dates. If available, it will proceed to reserve the room and notify the user of the booking confirmation. However, if the room is unavailable for any part of the specified range, the function might return a message indicating the unavailability, prompting the user to select alternative dates or accommodations.\n\nEdge cases to consider include handling reservations that span seasons with different pricing or availability, as well as ensuring that public holidays or special events do not affect the reservation process without notification to the client. Additionally, the function should manage any pre-booked rooms or maintenance schedules that could impede availability.\n\nOverall, this function serves as an essential tool for guests looking to secure accommodations during their travels, offering a streamlined and efficient booking process for hotel rooms over a specific date range.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"hotel_name": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the hotel."}, "location": {"type": "string", "description": "The city and state, e.g. New York, NY."}, "start_date": {"type": "string", "description": "The start date of the reservation.
