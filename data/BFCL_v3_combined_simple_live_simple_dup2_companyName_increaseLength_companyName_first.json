The last non-zero remainder is the gcd of the original pair of integers.\n\nHere is a usage example of the function:\n\nSuppose you want to find the gcd of 48 and 18. The function will first divide 48 by 18, resulting in a remainder of 12. Then, it will divide 18 by 12, yielding a remainder of 6. Next, 12 is divided by 6, resulting in a remainder of 0. Since the remainder is now zero, the greatest common divisor is the last non-zero remainder, which is 6. Therefore, the gcd(48, 18) is 6.\n\nIn summary, this function efficiently computes and returns the greatest common divisor of two integers, handling edge cases such as zero inputs appropriately, and utilizing the well-established Euclidean algorithm to ensure accurate and efficient computation.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"num1": {"type": "integer", "description": "The first number."}, "num2": {"type": "integer", "description": "The second number."}}, "required": ["num1", "num2"]}}]}

This is done repeatedly until the number is no longer divisible by 2. The function then proceeds to check subsequent odd numbers, which are potential prime factors, up to the square root of the remaining quotient.

It should be a positive number indicating the existing population size at the start of the estimation period.\n  \n- **growth_rate (float):** The growth rate is expressed as a decimal (e.g., 0.05 for a 5% growth rate). It represents the annual increase in the elephant population. A positive growth rate indicates that the population is expected to increase, whereas a negative growth rate would suggest a decline.\n\n- **years (int):** This optional parameter specifies the number of years into the future for which you want the population estimate. If not provided, the function defaults to estimating the population one year into the future.\n\n#### Returns:\n- **future_population (float):** The function returns an estimated population size as a floating-point number.

These categories typically classify BMI values into the following ranges:\n\n- Underweight: BMI less than 18.5\n- Normal weight: BMI between 18.5 and 24.9\n- Overweight: BMI between 25 and 29.9\n- Obesity: BMI 30 or greater\n\nIt is important to note that while BMI is a useful general indicator of health based on weight and height, it does not directly measure body fat or consider factors such as muscle mass, bone density, or distribution of fat.

This should include both predictor variables (features) and target variables (labels), formatted as a DataFrame or a similar tabular structure. The dataset should be pre-processed before being passed to the function, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing or standardizing features if necessary.\n\n- **n_estimators** (optional): An integer specifying the number of trees in the forest. More trees generally improve the performance but also increase computational cost and memory usage. A typical default value is 100, but this can be adjusted based on dataset size and performance considerations.\n\n- **max_depth** (optional): The maximum depth of the tree. Limiting the depth can prevent overfitting, especially with smaller datasets. If not specified, nodes are expanded until all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain fewer than `min_samples_split` samples.\n\n- **random_state** (optional): Controls the randomness of the bootstrapping of the samples and the selection of features when looking for the best split at each node. Setting this parameter ensures reproducibility of results.\n\n#### Returns:\n\n- **model**: The trained Random Forest model object. This object can be used to make predictions on new data using the `predict` method, and it can be further evaluated using metrics such as accuracy for classification tasks or mean squared error for regression tasks.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nHere is a basic example of how this function might be used in practice:", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"n_estimators": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of trees in the forest."}, "max_depth": {"type": "integer", "description": "The maximum depth of the tree."}, "data": {"type": "any", "description": "The training data for the model."}}, "required": ["n_estimators", "max_depth", "data"]}}]}

It is pertinent to check these assumptions before applying the t-test, as violations can affect the accuracy of the results. The datasets should be independent, meaning the observations in one dataset are not related to those in the other dataset.\n\nWhen conducting the t-test, the null hypothesis posits that there is no difference between the means of the two datasets. The alternative hypothesis suggests that a significant difference exists. The result of the t-test is a t-statistic and a p-value. The t-statistic measures the size of the difference relative to the variation in the sample data, while the p-value helps determine the significance of the results.

This calculation is fundamental for investors and stakeholders who are interested in understanding how much dividend income they can expect per share they own.\n\nTo perform this calculation, the function takes two primary inputs: the total dividend payout and the number of outstanding shares. The total dividend payout represents the aggregate amount of money that the company has decided to distribute to its shareholders for a particular quarter. Meanwhile, the outstanding shares refer to the total number of shares currently held by all shareholders, including company insiders but excluding treasury shares.\n\nThe calculation itself is straightforward: the function divides the total dividend payout by the number of outstanding shares. This division yields the dividend per share, which is expressed in the currency in which the dividend payout was made. It allows shareholders to determine the amount they will receive for each share they hold.\n\nEdge cases to consider might include scenarios where the number of outstanding shares changes significantly during the quarter due to events like stock splits, buybacks, or additional share issuances. These can affect the calculation if not properly accounted for, although such adjustments are typically handled outside of the basic function.\n\nHere is an example usage of the function:\n\nSuppose a company declares a total dividend payout of $500,000 for the quarter, and there are 1,000,000 outstanding shares.

This function requires two primary inputs: a series of cash flows and the discount rate. The series of cash flows typically includes both incoming and outgoing payments over a specified period, where each cash flow can occur at different intervals, such as annually, semi-annually, or monthly.\n\nThe discount rate is the interest rate used to discount future cash flows back to their present value, reflecting the risk and opportunity cost associated with the investment.

This yield is typically expressed as a percentage, reflecting the anticipated growth rate of the investment over one year. For example, a yearly yield of 5% indicates that the investment is projected to grow by 5% over a one-year period.\n\nThe **investment amount** is the principal sum of money that is initially invested into the mutual fund. This value represents the starting point for the calculation and is the base on which the yearly yield will be applied. For instance, if an investor allocates $10,000 to the mutual fund, this amount would be used as the investment amount in the calculation.\n\nThe **time period** is the duration for which the investment is held in the mutual fund, typically measured in years. The time period determines how many times the yearly yield will be applied to the investment amount to calculate the total return. A longer time period generally results in a higher return due to the compounding effect of the yield applied over multiple years. For example, if the time period is 5 years, the function will calculate the compounded return over these 5 years.\n\nThe function is likely to use a mathematical formula that incorporates these three parameters to estimate the total return of the investment after the specified time period.

It requires three key parameters: the initial investment amount, the annual rate of return, and the time frame over which the investment will grow. By leveraging these inputs, the function applies the principles of compound interest to determine the amount of money that the initial investment will grow to at the end of the specified period.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **Initial Investment**: This parameter represents the principal amount or the initial sum of money that is being invested. It is crucial as it forms the base upon which the investment will grow. The value should be input as a positive numerical value, typically in the currency of the investment.\n\n2. **Annual Rate of Return**: This parameter denotes the expected yearly rate of return on the investment, expressed as a decimal. For instance, an annual rate of return of 5% should be entered as 0.05. It represents the percentage gain on the investment each year.\n\n3. **Time Frame**: This is the duration over which the investment will be held and allowed to grow. It is expressed in years and should be a positive integer. The time frame directly impacts the compounding effect on the investment’s growth.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\nThe function calculates the future value by applying the formula for compound interest: \n\n\\[ \\text{Future Value} = \\text{Initial Investment} \\times (1 + \\text{Annual Rate of Return})^{\\text{Time Frame}} \\]\n\nThis formula ensures that the interest earned each year is added to the principal, and the total amount grows exponentially over the specified time frame, reflecting the power of compounding. The compounding occurs annually, meaning that at the end of each year, the interest is computed and added to the principal, becoming the new base for the calculation in the following year.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose you have an initial investment of $10,000, and", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"initial_investment": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial investment amount."}, "rate_of_return": {"type": "float", "description": "The annual rate of return."}, "years": {"type": "integer", "description": "The time frame of the investment in years."}, "contribution": {"type": "integer", "description": "Optional: Additional regular contributions.

These coordinates should be provided in a format that includes both the latitude and longitude of each point, usually expressed in decimal degrees. It's important that the input values are valid geographical coordinates, meaning that the latitude must range from -90 to 90 degrees, and the longitude must range from -180 to 180 degrees.\n\nThe function works by determining the vertical change in elevation between the two points. This elevation difference is typically derived from a digital elevation model (DEM) or similar data source that provides the altitude for any given location on Earth's surface. Simultaneously, the function calculates the horizontal distance between the two coordinates, accounting for the curvature of the Earth if necessary—often using the Haversine formula or similar methods for distance measurement.\n\nThe slope gradient is then computed as the ratio of the vertical change to the horizontal distance.

Higher input or weight increases firing rate and higher decay rate decreases it.This function is designed to compute the neuronal activity, specifically the rate at which a neuron fires, by evaluating several key parameters: the input synaptic rate, the weight of the synaptic inputs, and the decay rate. Each of these parameters plays a critical role in determining the overall firing rate of the neuron.\n\nFirstly, the input synaptic rate refers to the frequency at which signals are received by the neuron from synapses. An increase in this rate implies that the neuron is receiving more frequent inputs, which in turn can lead to a higher neuronal firing rate. This parameter is crucial as it represents the external stimulation that a neuron receives and processes.\n\nSecondly, the weight of the inputs is a measure of the strength or efficacy of each synaptic input. A higher weight means that each individual input has a stronger effect on the neuron, contributing more significantly to the neuronal firing rate. This parameter typically reflects the importance or priority of certain inputs over others.\n\nLastly, the decay rate is a factor that reduces the overall firing rate of the neuron. It represents the natural tendency of the neuron's activity to diminish over time due to various inhibitory processes or energy constraints. A higher decay rate indicates stronger inhibitory effects or faster dissipation of the neuron's activity, thus lowering the overall firing rate.\n\nBy combining these parameters, the function calculates the rate of neuronal firing as a balance between excitatory inputs (input synaptic rate and weight) and inhibitory influences (decay rate). For instance, if both the input synaptic rate and weight of inputs are high, the neuron is more likely to fire at a higher rate, assuming the decay rate does not proportionately offset this effect. Conversely, if the decay rate is high, it counteracts the excitatory influences, leading to a lower firing rate.\n\nHere's an example of how this function might be used. Suppose you have a neuron with an input synaptic rate of 5 Hz, a synaptic weight of 2, and a decay rate of 1.

Account for coverage efficiency of the paint and exclusions (like windows).The function is designed to determine the total amount of paint necessary to cover a specified area effectively. This calculation takes into account several critical factors to ensure accuracy. Firstly, the total area to be covered must be provided as an input parameter, typically measured in square units such as square feet or square meters, depending on the context.\n\nIn addition to the area itself, the function must also consider the paint's coverage efficiency, which is a measure of how much area a single unit of paint can cover. This efficiency is often provided by the paint manufacturer and is usually expressed in terms of square units per gallon or liter. By incorporating this efficiency factor, the function can accurately estimate the quantity of paint required, ensuring that there is neither a surplus nor a shortage.\n\nAnother important aspect of the calculation involves accounting for any exclusions within the area to be painted. These exclusions typically include features such as windows, doors, or any other elements that should not be painted. The function should allow input for the total area of these exclusions and subtract them from the overall area, thus refining the estimate to represent only the paintable surface.\n\nTo illustrate, consider the following usage example: if a room has a total wall area of 500 square feet, with windows and doors covering 50 square feet, and the paint covers 350 square feet per gallon, the function should first subtract the exclusion area (50 square feet) from the total area (500 square feet), resulting in 450 square feet of paintable surface. Then, it divides this by the coverage efficiency (350 square feet per gallon) to determine that approximately 1.29 gallons of paint are required. In practical terms, this would typically be rounded up to ensure complete coverage.\n\nIn summary, the function's purpose is to provide a precise estimate of the paint required by considering the total area, adjusting for paint coverage efficiency, and subtracting any areas that do not need painting. This ensures an efficient and cost-effective use of resources while accommodating all necessary adjustments for exclusions", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"area": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"width": {"type": "integer", "description": "The width of the area to be painted in feet."}, "height": {"type": "integer", "description": "The height of the area to be painted in feet."}}, "description": "The area to be painted."}, "paint_coverage": {"type": "integer", "description": "Coverage area per gallon of the paint in square feet.", "default": 350}, "exclusion": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"type": {"type": "string", "description": "The type of the exclusion e.g window, door etc."}, "area": {"type": "integer", "description": "The area of the exclusion in square feet."}}, "description": "Area not to be painted.

The rectangle is defined by its dimensions, where the width represents the horizontal length, and the height signifies the vertical length of the shape.\n\n#### Parameters\n- **Width (w):** A numerical value that determines the horizontal extent of the rectangle. This parameter is crucial because it sets the length of the rectangle from one side to the opposite side, along the horizontal axis. Ensure that the value provided is positive and ideally a whole number, as negative or zero values do not logically represent a physical dimension and might cause the function to behave unexpectedly or not render a visible shape.\n  \n- **Height (h):** A numerical value indicating the vertical reach of the rectangle. Like the width, this parameter must be positive and is typically a whole number to ensure the shape is drawn correctly without errors. It defines how tall the rectangle is from its bottom side to its top side.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n- **Zero or Negative Dimensions:** If either the width or height is zero or negative, the function may not create a visible rectangle, as these values are not feasible for forming such a shape.\n- **Non-integer Dimensions:** Supplying non-integer values (e.g., floating-point numbers) might lead to rounding or truncation, depending on the implementation specifics of the function. It is crucial to understand how the underlying system handles such inputs to anticipate the output accurately.\n\n#### Usage Example\nTo draw a rectangle with a width of 5 units and a height of 3 units, call the function as follows:\n\n```python\ndraw_rectangle(5, 3)\n```\n\nThis invocation will result in a rectangle that is 5 units wide and 3 units tall, depicted within the constraints or medium provided by the function (such as a GUI canvas or a console output).\n\n### Functionality\nThe function works by utilizing the", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"width": {"type": "integer", "description": "The width of the rectangle."}, "height": {"type": "integer", "description": "The height of the rectangle."}, "color": {"type": "string", "description": "The color of the rectangle.

The analysis focuses on evaluating various aspects that are crucial for understanding the building's integrity, safety, and design efficiency.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **Id (string or integer):** This parameter serves as the unique identifier for the building. It allows the function to access specific data related to the building, ensuring that the analysis is accurate and relevant. The Id could be a string or an integer, depending on the database or system in use, and it must correspond to an existing record to avoid errors during the analysis process.\n\n- **floorNumbers (integer):** This parameter indicates the total number of floors within the building. It is crucial for assessing the building's vertical structure and helps in calculating aspects such as load distribution, structural stability, and emergency evacuation plans. The value must be a non-negative integer, as negative numbers or non-integers would not make physical sense in the context of a building's floors.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\nThe function leverages the Id to retrieve information about the building, such as its dimensions, materials used, load-bearing design, and architectural features, from a centralized database or repository. Using the provided number of floors, it can make calculations related to structural load distribution, potential stress points, and compliance with building codes and safety standards.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- If the Id does not match any existing building record, the function should handle this gracefully, possibly by returning a meaningful error message or an empty result indicating that the building cannot be found.\n\n- If the floorNumbers parameter is zero, this might indicate a non-standard structure, such as a pavilion or a single-floor design, which may require special handling in the analysis.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\n```python\n# Example of calling the AnalyzeBuildingStructure function\nresult = AnalyzeBuildingStructure(Id=12345, floorNumbers=10)\n```\n\nIn this example", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"building_id": {"type": "string", "description": "The unique identification number of the building."}, "floors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "integer"}, "description": "Floor numbers to be analyzed."}, "mode": {"type": "string", "description": "Mode of analysis, e.g. 'static' or 'dynamic'.

The radius, which is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on its boundary, serves as the sole input parameter for this function.\n\nTo calculate the area of the circle, the function utilizes the mathematical formula for the area of a circle, which is expressed as A = π * r^2. Here, A represents the area, π (pi) is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159, and r is the radius provided by the user. The function squares the radius and multiplies the result by π to obtain the area.\n\nFor determining the circumference, which is the total distance around the circle, the function applies the formula C = 2 * π * r. In this formula, C denotes the circumference, and once again, π is the mathematical constant, while r represents the radius. By multiplying the radius by 2 and then by π, the function calculates the circumference.\n\nEdge cases to consider include when the radius is zero or a negative number. If the radius is zero, both the area and circumference will be zero, as there is no circle to measure. In the case of a negative radius, which is not physically meaningful in the context of a circle, the function may need to either return an error or handle the input in a predefined manner, such as taking the absolute value of the radius, depending on implementation specifics.\n\nA typical usage example for this function would involve calling it with a positive numerical value for the radius. For instance, if the radius is provided as 5 units, the function would calculate an area of approximately 78.54 square units (using the formula π * 5^2) and a circumference of approximately 31.42 units (applying the formula 2 * π * 5).", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"radius": {"type": "integer", "description": "The radius of the circle."}}, "required": ["radius"]}}]}

This ranking is determined based on the results and performance metrics of a particular season and the type of league being considered. The function aims to provide insights into where the team stands among its competitors by evaluating its achievements during the specified timeframe.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `season`: This parameter allows the user to specify the particular season for which they want to obtain the team rankings. This could be represented in various formats, such as a single year (e.g., 2023) or a range of years (e.g., 2022-2023) depending on how the sports league organizes its seasons. It is crucial for the user to input the correct season to ensure the accuracy of the ranking data retrieved.\n\n- `type`: The `type` parameter refers to the specific category or division within the league. Sports leagues often have multiple types such as regular season, playoffs, or different divisions/classes within the league. Selecting the appropriate type is essential for obtaining the correct and relevant ranking as it influences the context and scope of the standings.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\nSuppose a user wants to find out how their favorite basketball team ranked during the 2022 season in the regular season category. The user would call the function with `season` set as `2022` and `type` as `Regular Season`. The function would then process these inputs, access the historical data for the specified season and type, and return the team's ranking position among all competing teams.\n\n**Edge Cases and Considerations:**\n\n- It is important to ensure that the season and type inputs are valid and correspond to existing data within the league's records.

The `rank` parameter represents the value of the card, which can vary from numbers such as 2 through 10 to face cards like Jack, Queen, King, and Ace. The second parameter, `suit`, indicates one of the four possible categories: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, or Spades. By providing these parameters, the function systematically searches through the deck to identify and locate the card that exactly matches both the specified rank and suit.\n\nThe function assumes that the input deck is a complete set of 52 playing cards, each uniquely defined by a combination of rank and suit. If the deck is structured as a list or array, the function would iterate over each card, comparing the rank and suit of each card in the deck to the provided parameters.

It then divides this by the total number of possible 5-card hands that can be dealt from the deck. With a 52-card deck, the total number of possible hands is calculated as \"52 choose 5\", which represents the number of combinations of 52 cards taken 5 at a time.\n\nThe function's output is a probability value, usually expressed as a decimal or a percentage, indicating the likelihood of being dealt a full house in a single hand of poker. It's important to note that this function assumes a fair and random distribution of cards. Additionally, it presumes no prior knowledge of other players' cards or any cards that may have been discarded, thus providing an unbiased statistical probability.\n\nExample usage of this function might involve invoking it without any additional parameters, as the calculation only depends on the fixed properties of a standard deck of cards. The result can be useful for players seeking to understand their odds in a game or for those involved in developing poker-related software or simulations. It's also important to highlight that the function does not account for strategic elements of gameplay, such as bluffing or betting strategies, as it solely focuses on the mathematical aspect of card distribution.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"deck_size": {"type": "integer", "description": "The size of the deck.

It performs an essential task by ensuring that the name of the food item, as provided in the customer's request, is altered to comply with a particular format requirement — being in uppercase letters. This functionality is crucial for maintaining uniformity and meeting system standards that dictate the use of uppercase for all food item entries.\n\n#### Functionality Details:\n- **Input:** The function takes in a food item name as part of the customer's order or request. It is expected that this name is provided as a string.\n- **Processing:** Upon receiving the input, the function processes the string to check and convert the food name to uppercase. This step ensures that regardless of how the food name is initially input (whether in lowercase, mixed case, etc.), it will be stored or returned in an uppercase format.\n- **Output:** The function outputs the modified food name, ensuring it is in uppercase, thus guaranteeing consistency across all food selections within the system.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- If the input food name is already in uppercase, the function will recognize this and maintain the current format without unnecessary modifications.\n- The function should handle cases where the input might be an empty string by appropriately managing such instances to prevent errors or unexpected behavior.\n- Non-string inputs should be checked and managed, either by converting them to strings if possible or raising an error to notify that the input is invalid.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nSuppose a customer requests \"pasta\" as their food choice. When this function is applied, the output will be \"PASTA,\" ensuring that the system records the food selection in the required uppercase format.\n\n```python\nchange_food_selection(\"pasta\")  # Output: \"PASTA\"\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates the function's role in transforming the input string to meet the uppercase requirement, highlighting how it achieves both data consistency and system compliance.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["TheFod"], "properties": {"TheFod": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the food to be changed, provided in uppercase letters only (e.g., 'PIZZA', 'BURGER').", "enum": ["PIZZA", "BURGER", "SALAD", "SOUP", "STEAK"]}}}}]}

This requirement is crucial for maintaining consistency, possibly due to system constraints or display standards that necessitate uniform formatting of food names.\n\nWhen the function is executed, it takes the customer's desired food selection as input and processes it to verify and transform the name into uppercase form. This step is essential to ensure that the entry complies with the predefined format standards that might be used throughout the system for data storage, retrieval, or display purposes.\n\nEdge cases that the function might handle include scenarios where the input food name is already in uppercase, which should be retained as is, or where the input is in mixed or lowercase, necessitating conversion to uppercase. Additionally, if the input is not a valid food name or does not exist in the list of available options, the function should ideally handle such exceptions gracefully, perhaps by notifying the user of the invalid entry or requesting a new input.\n\nFor example, if the customer requests a food item called \"pizza,\" the function would process this request by converting \"pizza\" to \"PIZZA\" before changing the selection. Conversely, if the input is already \"PIZZA,\" no transformation is needed, and the selection is updated directly.\n\nIn summary, this function plays a critical role in standardizing food selections by ensuring that all names are in uppercase, thus aligning with system requirements or user interface design principles.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["TheFod"], "properties": {"TheFod": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the food to be changed, provided in uppercase letters only (e.g., 'PIZZA', 'BURGER').", "enum": ["PIZZA", "BURGER", "SALAD", "SOUP", "STEAK"]}}}}]}

This ensures consistency and helps in preventing any issues related to case sensitivity that could arise during the processing of the request. \n\nTo use this function, the user should input the desired food name in all uppercase characters. For instance, if a customer wishes to select \"pizza,\" the input should be provided as \"PIZZA.\" The function will then verify that the input meets the uppercase requirement. If the input is correctly formatted, the function will proceed to change the selection of food to the specified item and update the relevant records or display accordingly. \n\nEdge cases to consider include ensuring that any extraneous spaces or non-alphabetic characters in the food name are handled appropriately before processing.

This function strictly requires both parameters to be integers; if any non-integer values are provided, the function may not work as intended, potentially leading to an error or unexpected behavior. The primary operation performed by this function is the arithmetic multiplication of the two integer values. \n\nFor example, if the function is called with the integers 3 and 4, it computes the product by multiplying 3 by 4, which results in 12. Therefore, the function will return 12 in this case. When dealing with multiplication, it is important to consider the possibility of exceeding typical integer limits, which may vary depending on the programming language and system architecture. In practice, this means that multiplying very large integers could result in an overflow, where the resulting product exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by an integer in the given environment.\n\nAnother example would be multiplying a positive and a negative integer, like -2 and 5. The function would return -10, as the product of a negative and a positive number is negative.

The primary purpose of this function is to perform a straightforward arithmetic addition operation, which is a fundamental function in many computational tasks.\n\n#### Parameters\n- **value1**: The first numeric value to be summed. This value can be of any numeric data type, including integers and floating-point numbers. The function will use this as the initial operand in the addition operation.\n  \n- **value2**: The second numeric value to be summed. Like `value1`, this can also be any numeric data type, including integers and floating-point numbers. This value acts as the second operand in the addition operation.\n\n#### Return Value\n- The function returns the result of the addition of `value1` and `value2`. The return type will match the type that can accommodate the result of the addition. For instance, if both inputs are integers, the result will be an integer. However, if at least one input is a floating-point number, the result will be a floating-point number to preserve precision.\n\n#### Edge Cases and Considerations\n- If both input parameters are integers and their sum exceeds the maximum value storable in an integer type, the function should handle this by either returning an error or converting the result to a floating-point number, depending on the language-specific behavior.\n- The function should handle special numeric values such as `NaN` (Not a Number) and `Infinity`. The presence of these values in `value1` or `value2` will result in a return value of `NaN` or `Infinity`, following the rules of arithmetic operations with such values.\n- If the inputs are of mismatched types (e.g., one integer and one floating-point number), the function will implicitly convert the integer to a floating-point number to ensure the operation is carried out correctly.\n\n#### Usage Example\nHere is", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["a", "b"], "properties": {"a": {"type": "float", "description": "The first operand in the summation; a floating-point number."}, "b": {"type": "float", "description": "The second operand in the summation; a floating-point number."}}}}]}

It prepares data for machine learning models, ensuring numerical values are scaled properly and categorical variables are appropriately transformed.This function is designed to preprocess input data in preparation for machine learning models by applying a series of transformations, specifically normalization and encoding of categorical variables. The preprocessing step is a crucial part of the data preparation pipeline, as it ensures that the input data is in a suitable format for model training and prediction. \n\nNormalization is applied to the numerical values within the dataset. This process adjusts the scale of the numerical features so that they contribute equally to the model's learning process. By scaling these values, the function helps to eliminate potential biases that could arise from differences in the range or units of measurement among the features. Normalization typically involves transforming the data to a standard range, such as 0 to 1, or adjusting it to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.\n\nIn addition to normalization, this function handles categorical variables by encoding them into numerical representations. Categorical variables, which contain discrete values or categories, must be transformed into a numerical format for most machine learning algorithms to process them effectively. The function achieves this by applying techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding. One-hot encoding represents each category as a separate binary feature, while label encoding assigns an integer value to each category. By converting categorical variables in this manner, the function ensures that these features can be utilized effectively in the modeling process.\n\nThe combined effect of normalization and encoding prepares the dataset by maintaining the integrity and usefulness of data while ensuring that all variables are transformed in a way that is compatible with machine learning algorithms.

For strings, it returns the characters in reverse order. For booleans, it returns the negation. For numbers, it returns the negative value.This function is designed to reverse the given input by transforming it into an opposite or inverted form based on its data type. It handles different types of inputs, including strings, booleans, and numbers, each with their specific rules for reversal:\n\n- **Strings**: When the input is a string, this function processes it by reversing the order of its characters. For example, if the input string is \"hello\", the function will return \"olleh\". This reversal is achieved by iterating over the string from the end to the beginning, constructing a new string that starts with the last character of the input and ends with the first.\n\n- **Booleans**: In the case of a boolean input, the function returns its logical negation. Specifically, if the input is `true`, the function returns `false`, and if the input is `false`, the function returns `true`. This is accomplished using the logical NOT operation, which toggles the boolean state.\n\n- **Numbers**: For numerical inputs, the function returns the negative of the given number. For example, if the input is `5`, the function returns `-5`, and if the input is `-3`, it returns `3`. This inversion is performed by multiplying the number by `-1`, effectively changing its sign.\n\nEdge cases and considerations include ensuring that the input is of a recognized type (string, boolean, or number) before attempting to reverse it. If the input is of an unsupported type, the function may need to handle this scenario, potentially by throwing an error or returning a specific value indicating the unsupported type. Additionally, for integer inputs that are `0`, the function will return `0`, as the negative of zero is still zero. It is important to consider how the function should behave with complex numbers or other numerical types that might not clearly fall into the typical category of integers or floats.\n\nIn summary, this versatile function adapts its behavior according to the type of input provided,", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["input_value"], "properties": {"input_value": {"type": "any", "description": "The value to be reversed.

The function does not capture the output of the command; it merely returns the status code indicating the success or failure of the command execution. \n\nAs an example, if you want to execute a single command like listing the contents of a directory, you might use:\n\n```python\nos.system('dir')\n```\n\nFor executing multiple commands, such as creating a directory and then listing its contents, you might write:\n\n```python\nos.system('mkdir new_directory && dir new_directory')\n```\n\nThis function is suitable for straightforward command execution needs. However, for more complex requirements, such as capturing command output or handling errors more gracefully, other functions like `subprocess.run()` might be more appropriate.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

It utilizes the `os.system()` method, which is a built-in function in Python's `os` module, to carry out the command execution. The primary purpose of this function is to allow users to interact with the underlying Windows operating system by sending commands that can be executed in the command shell.\n\n#### Functionality\n\n- **Command Execution**: The function can execute both individual commands and a series of commands. In the case of multiple commands, these can be chained together using the logical 'AND' operator `&&`. This means that each command will be executed sequentially, and the execution of subsequent commands will only occur if the previous command completes successfully without errors.\n  \n- **Windows OS Specific**: It is important to note that this function is tailored for use on Windows operating systems. While `os.system()` is available on other operating systems, the behavior and shell syntax may vary. Thus, this function is specifically optimized and intended for Windows environments.\n\n- **Return Value**: The `os.system()` function returns an exit status code of the command being executed. On Windows, a return value of `0` typically indicates that the command was executed successfully without errors. Any non-zero value usually signifies that an error occurred during the execution of the command.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n\n- **Command Syntax**: If there is a syntactical error in the command string, or if the command is not recognized by the Windows command shell, the execution will fail, and an error code will be returned. It is crucial for the user to ensure that the command string is correctly formatted and valid.\n\n- **Environment and Permissions**: The success of the command execution may depend on the environment in which the function is run. Certain commands might require administrative privileges. If such privileges are not granted, the command might fail, returning an error code.\n\n#### Example Usage\n\n- **Single Command Execution**: To run", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

This functionality is highly useful for automating command-line tasks or integrating system commands into Python scripts.\n\nThe function can handle not only individual commands but also multiple commands that are chained together using the '&&' operator. This chaining mechanism is particularly advantageous when you need to execute multiple commands in sequence and want subsequent commands to run only if the preceding ones succeed. For example, if you want to change the directory and then list its contents, you could pass a command string like `cd my_directory && dir` to the function. This ensures that the `dir` command will only execute if the `cd my_directory` command is successful.\n\nAn important detail to note is that because this function utilizes the `os.system()` method, it is synchronous, meaning the Python script will wait for the command to complete before moving on to execute the next line of code.

This functionality is particularly useful for planning events, travel, or simply staying informed about future weather conditions in a given location. Users can specify the desired city for which they wish to obtain the forecast, ensuring that the information is tailored to their particular geographic area of interest. Additionally, the function allows the user to select a particular date, which can be a current or future date, enabling them to access weather predictions for that specific time. \n\nUsage of this function would typically involve input parameters that define both the city and the date. It is important for users to ensure that the input city is recognized by the system, which may require using an official city name or ensuring correct spelling. The date parameter should be formatted correctly according to the system’s requirements, commonly in the format of year-month-day (YYYY-MM-DD), ensuring that the date is within a range for which forecasts are available. \n\nThis function can handle a variety of edge cases, such as cities with the same name in different countries. In such cases, additional parameters like country code might be necessary to accurately specify the intended location. The function may also need to address the handling of dates that are too far in the future, beyond the range of available forecast data. \n\nThe output of this function is typically a structured data set that includes key weather elements such as temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy) for the specified city on the given date.

It should be provided in string format. The city name must be correctly spelled and preferably include any necessary suffixes or prefixes (such as \"New York\" or \"Los Angeles\") to ensure accurate retrieval of the forecast data specific to that location.\n  \n- **Date (date or string):** The function also requires the date for which the weather prediction is needed. This can typically be provided in a date format recognized by the system, such as \"YYYY-MM-DD\". It is important to ensure that the date is valid and falls within the range for which forecast data is available. Future dates can generally be accommodated, but there might be limitations on how far in advance the forecast can be reliably retrieved. Similarly, past dates may not be supported as the function focuses primarily on forecasting rather than historical weather data.\n\n### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose you wish to find out the weather in Paris on December 25, 2023. You would call the function with the \"City\" parameter set to \"Paris\" and the \"Date\" parameter set to \"2023-12-25\".

This is particularly useful for users who are fans of certain filmmakers and wish to explore more of their work.\n\n2. **Genre Parameter**: Users can also define a specific genre or multiple genres that they are interested in. The function will filter the movie list to include only those that fall under the specified genre(s). Genres can range from action, comedy, drama, horror, thriller, science fiction, and more, enabling users to find movies that match their current mood or interest.\n\n3. **Cast Parameter**: Additionally, users can input names of actors or actresses they wish to see in the movies. The function will then compile a list of movies featuring the specified cast members. This is ideal for users who are looking to watch films with their favorite actors or actresses.\n\nThe function will only return movies that match all the provided criteria. If a user specifies all three parameters—director, genre, and cast—the resulting list will contain movies that simultaneously match the director, fall within the chosen genre, and include the specified cast members. However, if any parameter is left unspecified, the function will only filter movies based on the parameters provided.\n\n**Usage Example**: Suppose a user is interested in finding movies directed by Christopher Nolan, within the science fiction genre, and starring actor Leonardo DiCaprio. By utilizing this function, the user would receive a list of movies that match all these criteria, such as \"Inception.\"\n\nThis function serves as a powerful tool for users to narrow down their movie search efficiently, allowing them to quickly find films that align with their specific tastes and preferences", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": [], "properties": {"directed_by": {"type": "string", "description": "Director of the movie.

It takes a single argument, `query`, which represents the keywords that the user wants to use to find the desired song. These keywords could include the song title, artist name, album, or a combination of these elements.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- `query` (string): This is a required parameter that specifies the search criteria. The function expects a string input that may contain the name of the song, the artist, or any relevant keyword associated with the music track the user wishes to play. The more specific the query, the more accurate the search results will be.\n\n#### Functionality:\n1. **Search Mechanism:** The function initiates a search on the Spotify platform using the provided query. It sends a request to Spotify's search API to retrieve a list of songs that match the given criteria. The search is comprehensive and scans a wide database of music, covering various genres, artists, and albums.\n\n2. **Selection and Playback:** After retrieving the search results, the function selects the most relevant song based on the query. The criteria for selecting the best match could include exact title matches, the popularity of the song, or recency of release. Once the appropriate track is identified, the function sends a command to Spotify to play the song through the user's Spotify account.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- If the query is vague or too broad, the function may return multiple results, and the selection might not always be the user's intended choice.\n- In scenarios where no matches are found for the given query, the function should handle this gracefully, potentially by notifying the user of the issue or suggesting alternative queries.\n- The function assumes that the user is authenticated with Spotify and has an active session for playback to occur.

The volume level can be specified as an integer percentage between 0 (mute) and 100 (maximum volume).The function is designed to adjust the global volume level for all audio playback across the system. This means that it impacts the overall loudness of any sound produced by the device, including music, videos, system alerts, and other audio outputs. Users can specify the desired volume level by providing an integer value that represents a percentage. The valid range for this integer percentage is from 0 to 100, inclusive. A value of 0 corresponds to mute, where no sound is audible, effectively silencing all audio outputs. Conversely, a value of 100 sets the audio to the maximum volume level, ensuring that all sounds are played at their highest possible loudness. \n\nIt is important to note that values outside this specified range are not acceptable and may result in an error or be automatically adjusted to fit within the valid range. For example, if a value below 0 or above 100 is passed to the function, it might be clamped to the nearest boundary value (0 or 100, respectively). This function is often used in applications where users need control over audio playback, such as media players or system settings panels.\n\nHere is an example of how the function might be used:\n\n```python\nset_global_volume(75)\n```\n\nIn this example, the global volume is set to 75%, which represents a moderately high level of sound output but is not at the maximum.

The user ID is a required parameter, while the status is optional and can be used to filter the mandates by their current status.This function is designed to retrieve a comprehensive list of mandates associated with a specific user. To successfully execute this function, it requires the provision of the user's unique identifier, often referred to as the user ID. This is a mandatory parameter, as it allows the function to accurately target and fetch mandates that belong to the particular user in question.\n\nIn addition to the user ID, this function offers the flexibility of an optional parameter—status. The status parameter enables users to fine-tune the query by filtering the mandates based on their current status. This means that if the status is specified, the function will return only those mandates which match the given status criteria. If this parameter is left unspecified, the function defaults to retrieving all mandates associated with the user, irrespective of their current status.\n\nFor example, calling this function with only the user ID will result in an unfiltered list of mandates. If, however, both the user ID and a specific status are provided, the function will narrow down the results to include only those mandates that are in the specified status. This dual parameter capability ensures both broad and precise data retrieval, depending on the needs of the user.\n\nThis function is particularly useful in scenarios where a user needs to monitor or audit their mandates, allowing for effective management and oversight based on current mandate statuses.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["user_id"], "properties": {"user_id": {"type": "string", "description": "The unique identifier of the user for whom the mandates need to be fetched."}, "status": {"type": "string", "description": "The current status of the mandates to fetch.

The primary purpose of this function is to ensure that user queries are addressed accurately and efficiently, particularly in scenarios where the automated system encounters a question or issue that it cannot adequately resolve on its own. The function activates when the automated system reaches a threshold of uncertainty or inability to provide a satisfactory response, thereby triggering the transfer process.\n\nUpon activation, the function initiates a series of steps to seamlessly hand off the conversation. Firstly, it identifies available human agents who can take over the interaction. It might prioritize agents based on their expertise, availability, or workload to ensure that the query is resolved promptly and effectively. Once an appropriate agent is selected, the function transfers all relevant details of the chat interaction to the agent. This includes the context of the conversation, previous questions, and the responses provided by the automated system, allowing the agent to understand the situation quickly and continue assisting the user without unnecessary repetition.\n\nIn addition to improving user experience by reducing frustration from unresolved queries, this function helps maintain the credibility of the support system by ensuring users receive the most accurate information possible. It is particularly useful in complex or sensitive scenarios where human judgment and empathy are required to address user concerns effectively.\n\nAn example of where this function would be activated is when a user asks a question that involves multi-step problem-solving or requires access to specific account details that the automated system cannot retrieve or process. By transferring the chat to a human agent, the function ensures that the user receives the necessary assistance in a timely manner. \n\nEdge cases for this function might include scenarios where no human agents are available.
