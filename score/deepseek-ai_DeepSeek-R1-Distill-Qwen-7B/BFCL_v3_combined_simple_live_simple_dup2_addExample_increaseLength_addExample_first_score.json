The calculation leverages the fundamental geometric formula for the area of a triangle, which is derived from the basic principles of geometry.\n\n#### Formula Used:\nThe area \\( A \\) of a triangle is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\]\n\n#### Parameters:\n1. **Base (base):**\n   - Type: A non-negative numeric value.\n   - Description: Represents the length of the base of the triangle. This is one of the sides of the triangle, ideally perpendicular to the height.\n   - Edge Cases: If the base is zero or negative, the area calculation will yield zero or may be deemed invalid in a practical context, as a valid triangle cannot have a zero or negative base.\n\n2. **Height (height):**\n   - Type: A non-negative numeric value.\n   - Description: Represents the vertical height from the base to the opposite vertex of the triangle. The height must be perpendicular to the base.\n   - Edge Cases: Similar to the base, if the height is zero or negative, the area calculation will also result in zero or may be considered invalid, as a practical triangle cannot have a zero or negative height.\n\n#### Edge Cases and Considerations:\n- **Zero Values:** If either the base or the height is zero, the triangle essentially collapses to a line or point, and thus, its computed area will be zero.\n- **Negative Values:** Negative values for base or height are not physically meaningful in the geometrical context of a triangle and should be avoided or handled with appropriate error checking in implementation.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n```python\n# Example usage of the function to calculate the area of a triangle\nbase_value = 10  # Units (e.g", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"base": {"type": "integer", "description": "The base of the triangle."}, "height": {"type": "integer", "description": "The height of the triangle."}, "unit": {"type": "string", "description": "The unit of measure (defaults to 'units' if not specified)"}}, "required": ["base", "height"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\ncalculate_triangle_area1({'base': 10, 'height': 5})", "model_result_decoded": [{"calculate_triangle_area1": {}}], "possible_answer": [{"calculate_triangle_area1": {"base": [10], "height": [5], "unit": ["units", ""]}}, {"calculate_triangle_area2": {"base": [10], "height": [5], "unit": ["units", ""]}}, {"calculate_triangle_area3": {"base": [10], "height": [5], "unit": ["units", ""]}}]}

This calculation is equivalent to finding the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed by the vector and the coordinate axes. The Euclidean norm is determined by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the vector's components, x and y. This process involves squaring each of the vector's components, adding these squared values together, and then taking the square root of the resulting sum.

It is designed to provide a straightforward method for determining how much space the triangle occupies on a two-dimensional plane, given these two parameters.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **base (b)**: A numerical value representing the length of the base of the triangle. This value should be a positive number, as negative or zero values would not logically represent a physical dimension of a triangle.\n  \n- **height (h)**: A numerical value representing the perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite vertex of the triangle, also known as altitude. Similar to the base, this should be a positive number to ensure it accurately reflects a physical property of the triangle.\n\n#### Formula:\n\nThe area \\( A \\) of a triangle is calculated using the formula:\n\\[ A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\]\n\nThis formula derives from the understanding that the area of a triangle is essentially half the area of a rectangle with the same base and height.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- If either the base or the height is zero, the resulting area will be zero because a triangle with no height or no base does not occupy any space.\n- Negative values for base or height are not valid inputs, as dimensions cannot be negative in standard geometric interpretations.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nConsider a triangle with a base of 5 units and a height of 10 units. Using the function:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 5 \\times 10 = 25 \\]\nThus, the area of the triangle is 25 square units.\n\nThis function is particularly useful in various fields such as architecture, engineering, and any geometric calculations where understanding the spatial coverage of a triangular shape is necessary.

To determine the final velocity, the function requires three parameters as inputs: the initial velocity of the object, the acceleration acting on the object, and the time duration over which the acceleration is applied. \n\nThe initial velocity is the velocity of the object at the start of the time period being considered. It is essential to note whether this velocity is in the same direction as the acceleration, as this will affect the magnitude of the final velocity. Acceleration, on the other hand, is the rate at which the velocity of the object is changing with respect to time. It can either be positive, which means the object is speeding up, or negative, which indicates the object is slowing down, commonly referred to as deceleration. Time is the duration over which the acceleration occurs, usually measured in seconds, and must be a non-negative number since a negative time duration does not make physical sense.\n\nThe formula used by the function to compute the final velocity is derived from one of the basic equations of motion in physics: \n\n\\[ \\text{final velocity} = \\text{initial velocity} + (\\text{acceleration} \\times \\text{time}) \\]\n\nThis equation assumes that the acceleration is constant over the time period considered.

Returns an empty string if the LLM output is 'answer not found'.This function serves the important role of analyzing and evaluating the output produced by a Language Learning Model (LLM) to ensure that it meets certain criteria of validity. Upon receiving the generated answer from the LLM, the function performs a parsing operation to dissect and comprehend the structure and content of the response.\n\nThe primary purpose of the parsing process is to detect whether the LLM's output includes a specific phrase indicating that the desired answer could not be determined. Specifically, the function is designed to identify the occurrence of the phrase 'answer not found' within the LLM's output. If this exact phrase is detected, it signifies that the LLM was unable to formulate a valid or relevant response to the query it was given.\n\nIn such cases where the phrase 'answer not found' is present, the function will not proceed with any further validation processes or attempt to interpret the response as meaningful information. Instead, it will promptly return an empty string. This return value of an empty string serves as a clear indicator to the calling process or user that the LLM was unable to generate a suitable answer to the input query.\n\nThe function is particularly useful in scenarios where it is crucial to distinguish between valid, informative outputs and instances where the LLM acknowledges its limitations in understanding or responding to a given query. By returning an empty string, the function provides a straightforward mechanism to handle cases where the LLM's capabilities fall short, allowing further decision-making processes to accommodate or address the lack of a valid answer.\n\nExample usage of the function might include situations where an application interfaces with an LLM to provide users with answers to questions and needs to ensure that the responses given are both relevant and meaningful. For instance, the function could be integrated into a larger system that logs user queries and LLM responses, selectively ignoring or flagging cases where the output is identified as lacking by returning an empty string.

In thermodynamics, entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness in a system, and understanding changes in entropy is crucial for analyzing energy exchanges in various physical and chemical processes.\n\nFor an isothermal process, the temperature remains constant throughout the entire process. This condition is significant because it allows simplifications in the calculation of entropy. The function assumes that the system is in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings, maintaining a constant temperature.\n\nIn addition to being isothermal, the process is also reversible. A reversible process is an idealized concept in thermodynamics where the system changes in such a way that both the system and its surroundings can be returned to their original states with no net change. Reversible processes are an important theoretical model because they represent the maximum efficiency with which energy can be converted or transferred.\n\nTo calculate the entropy change, the function uses the formula:\n\n\\[ \\Delta S = \\frac{Q_{\\text{rev}}}{T} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\Delta S \\) is the change in entropy.\n- \\( Q_{\\text{rev}} \\) is the amount of heat absorbed or released by the system during the reversible process.\n- \\( T \\) is the absolute temperature at which the process occurs.\n\nThis formula highlights the direct relationship between the heat exchanged and entropy change for a reversible process: the greater the amount of heat exchanged at a given temperature, the greater the change in entropy.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\nConsider a system where 500 J of heat is absorbed from a reservoir at a constant temperature of 300 K.

The service connects to a vast database of linguistic resources, ensuring accurate and contextually appropriate translations.\n\nThe parameters for this function generally include:\n\n1. **Source Language**: This identifies the language of the input text. It can be specified using standardized language codes (such as 'en' for English, 'es' for Spanish, etc.), allowing the service to accurately interpret the text's linguistic structure.\n\n2. **Target Language**: This specifies the language into which the source text should be translated. Like the source language, it is indicated using standard language codes, guiding the translation service in selecting the appropriate linguistic rules and vocabulary for conversion.\n\n3. **Text Input**: This is the actual content that needs to be translated. It can range from a simple word or phrase to complex sentences and paragraphs.\n\nThe translation process involves several intricate steps, such as tokenizing the input text, identifying its grammatical structures, and then rendering the equivalent expressions in the target language. The service may also handle edge cases, such as idiomatic expressions or cultural nuances, to deliver translations that are not just literal conversions but also contextually meaningful.\n\nUsage Example:\nSuppose you intend to translate the English sentence \"Hello, how are you?\" into French.

The function's operation is contingent upon a specified parameter or flag which determines the order of sorting. \n\nWhen the ascending order is chosen, the function rearranges the list so that each element is less than or equal to the element that follows it. This means numbers will start from the smallest and increment to the largest, or strings will proceed alphabetically from A to Z.

The function returns the total amount with tax.The function is designed to compute the applicable sales tax for a specified purchase amount based on the sales tax rate of a particular jurisdiction. When provided with a purchase amount, the function determines the appropriate tax rate according to the given jurisdiction, applies this rate to calculate the sales tax due, and then adds the calculated tax to the original purchase amount. Consequently, the function returns the total amount payable, inclusive of the original purchase amount and the added sales tax.\n\n### Parameters:\n- **purchase_amount (float or int):** The monetary amount of the purchase before tax. It should be a positive numerical value representing the subtotal on which the sales tax will be computed.\n- **jurisdiction (string):** A string identifier for the geographical or political region in which the tax is being applied. This could be a state, province, or country, each having potentially different tax rates.\n\n### Return Value:\n- **total_amount (float):** This value represents the sum of the original purchase amount and the calculated sales tax. It reflects the total cost the buyer will need to pay, inclusive of the applicable sales tax for the specified jurisdiction.\n\n### Example Usage:\nSuppose a purchase is made in a jurisdiction with a sales tax rate of 5%. If the purchase amount is $100, this function will calculate a $5 sales tax, resulting in a total amount of $105 being returned. This ensures that the financial transaction reflects the correct tax obligations as determined by local laws and regulations.\n\n### Edge Cases and Considerations:\n- Ensure that the jurisdiction is correctly specified as the function relies on this to determine the correct tax rate. An incorrect jurisdiction could result in an inaccurate tax calculation.\n- The function assumes that the purchase amount is a valid numerical entry. Non-numeric or negative inputs should be handled appropriately to prevent incorrect outputs or errors.\n- It is important to verify that the tax rates for jurisdictions are up-to-date and correctly implemented in the function for accuracy.

Each of these parameters plays a crucial role in determining the overall market value of the property.\n\n- **Number of Bedrooms**: This parameter indicates the total count of bedrooms within the house. It is a significant factor as it often influences family size accommodation and, consequently, the house's market appeal and price.\n  \n- **Number of Bathrooms**: This parameter reflects the number of bathrooms available in the house. Properties with more bathrooms may offer greater convenience and luxury, thus potentially commanding a higher market price.\n  \n- **Area**: This parameter specifies the total livable or usable area of the house. Generally, properties with a larger area are valued higher due to the increased space they offer, which is attractive to buyers looking for spacious living environments.\n\nThe function processes these inputs to output an estimated price value. The price prediction could be based on historical data, real estate market trends, and perhaps other underlying statistical models or algorithms that consider these factors.

Allows for the bulk recording of query classifications in one function call.This function is designed to efficiently manage and record the classification of a large number of queries by associating them with specific intent names. It achieves this by leveraging keyword arguments, where each keyword corresponds to an intent name, and the associated value is a collection of queries that share this intent. By using this approach, users can perform bulk recordings of query classifications in a single function call, significantly streamlining the process.\n\n### Parameters\n\n- **intent_name**: Keyword arguments where each keyword represents the name of an intent. This acts as a label that describes the purpose or goal of the queries associated with it.\n\n- **queries**: The values that accompany each intent name keyword argument. These are the actual queries that need to be classified. They can be provided in various iterable forms, such as lists or tuples, allowing for flexibility in input data structures.\n\n### Functionality\n\nWhen you call this function, it processes each keyword argument, taking the name of the keyword as the intent and the corresponding value as the list of queries. The function then records the association between each query and its intent, effectively classifying them in bulk. This method is particularly useful for applications that require organizing a large number of queries systematically, such as natural language processing tasks, chatbots, or automated customer service systems.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- If no queries are provided for a given intent, the function will simply record the intent with an empty list of queries, ensuring that all intents are processed but without any associated data.\n  \n- If duplicate queries are provided under the same intent, the function will still record each instance, as this might be intentional depending on the use case (e.g., tracking frequency of certain queries).\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\n# Example of how to call the function with multiple intents and their associated queries\nrecord_classifications(\n    greeting=[\"Hello\", \"Hi there\", \"Good morning\"],\n    farewell=[\"Goodbye\", \"See you later\", \"Take care\"],\n    inquiry=[\"What's the weather", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["acc_routing_start", "atm_finder_start", "faq_link_accounts_start", "get_balance_start", "get_transactions_start", "outofscope"], "properties": {"acc_routing_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries requesting the bank routing numbers or account numbers."}, "atm_finder_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for locations of ATMs, specified in the format of 'City, State (abbr)', such as 'Berkeley, CA' or 'New York, NY'."}, "faq_link_accounts_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to linking accounts within the bank's system."}, "get_balance_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for account balances, available funds, or other financial balances."}, "get_transactions_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to viewing transactions, deposits, purchases, and transaction details."}, "outofscope": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries that do not classify to any other available intents."}}}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\nTo classify the query 'what is the weather like', we need to use the `record1` function.

When the input is a string, the function processes it by reversing the order of its characters, effectively providing the string in a backward reading manner. For example, if the string \"hello\" is passed as input, the function will return \"olleh\". This operation is particularly useful for operations that require backward iteration or when comparing mirrored text forms.\n\nIn the case of boolean inputs, the function operates by returning the logical negation of the input value.

The primary goal of this function is to interact with network management systems or APIs to extract information about the nodes, which can include switches, routers, or other networking devices, that are part of a particular fabric. \n\n### Parameters\n\n- **fabric_id**: This is a crucial parameter that uniquely identifies the fabric within the network for which the node information is being requested. It ensures that the correct set of nodes associated with the specified fabric is retrieved. It is important that this parameter is accurately provided in the request to avoid errors or retrieving data from an unintended fabric.\n\n### Usage Example\n\nWhen utilizing this function, it should be integrated into a system where network fabrics are managed, such as a data center configuration management tool or network orchestration service. Below is a hypothetical example of how this function might be called:\n\n```python\n# Assuming 'network_api_client' is an instance of a client capable of making HTTP requests\nfabric_id = \"fabric-12345\"\nnodes_list = network_api_client.get_nodes_by_fabric(fabric_id)\nprint(nodes_list)\n```\n\nIn this example, the function is expected to send a GET request, typically to a RESTful API endpoint, passing the fabric identifier as part of the URL or query parameters.

The NPV calculation is fundamental in financial analysis as it aids in determining the value of an investment by discounting future cash flows to their present value, thereby allowing for an assessment of profitability.\n\nTo perform this calculation, the function requires a series of cash flows, which are usually represented as a list or an array, where each element corresponds to a cash flow occurring at a specific time period. These cash flows may include both incoming cash, such as revenue, and outgoing cash, such as expenses or initial investments.\n\nThe function also requires an interest rate, often called the discount rate, which is a critical parameter in the NPV calculation. The discount rate reflects the time value of money, risk associated with the investment, and opportunity cost. It's used to discount future cash flows back to their present value, providing a comprehensive view of the project's worth today.\n\nFor each cash flow in the series, the function applies the formula for Net Present Value: NPV = \u03a3 (C_t / (1 + r)^t), where C_t represents the cash flow at time t, r is the discount rate, and t is the time period. This formula ensures that each future cash flow is appropriately adjusted for the time value of money.\n\nEdge cases to consider when using this function include scenarios where cash flows are zero or negative across all periods, which would result in an NPV of zero or a negative value, respectively. Additionally, attention should be paid to the choice of the discount rate, as an excessively high or low rate can significantly affect the NPV outcome, potentially leading to misleading investment decisions.\n\nHere is a simple usage example:\n\n```python\ncash_flows = [-1000, 300, 400, 500, 600]\ndiscount_rate = 0.05\n\nnpv = calculate_npv(c", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"cash_flows": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "integer"}, "description": "A list of cash flows."}, "discount_rate": {"type": "float", "description": "The annual interest rate used to discount the cash flows."}, "years": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "integer"}, "description": "A list of years when the cash flow occurs.

This calculation considers the effects of interest being compounded, meaning that interest is calculated on the initial principal, which accumulates over time, and subsequently on the interest already added to the principal at each compounding interval.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n1. **Principal (P):** \n   - This is the initial sum of money deposited or invested, serving as the base amount that interest will accrue on. It should be provided as a positive numerical value.\n   \n2. **Annual Interest Rate (r):** \n   - The percentage rate at which the principal amount earns interest per year. It's typically represented as a decimal (e.g., 5% as 0.05).\n   \n3. **Number of Compounding Periods per Year (n):** \n   - This refers to how often the interest is calculated and added to the principal within a year. Common compounding frequencies include annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, and daily.\n   \n4. **Time (t):** \n   - The total time in years for which the money is invested or borrowed. This time frame determines how long the principal will earn interest.\n\n#### Formula\n\nThe calculation of compound interest is based on the formula:\n\n\\[ A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( A \\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- \\( P \\) is the principal investment amount (initial deposit or loan amount).\n- \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n- \\( n \\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per unit year.\n- \\( t \\) is the time the money is invested or borrowed for, in years.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\nSuppose you deposit $1,000 in a savings account with an annual interest rate", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"principal": {"type": "integer", "description": "The principal amount that the interest is applied to."}, "rate": {"type": "float", "description": "The annual interest rate.

It bases its calculations on three key financial inputs: the purchase price of the stock, the sale price of the stock, and any dividends received during the holding period of the investment. By taking these inputs into account, the function provides a comprehensive measure of the investment's profitability over time.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **Purchase Price**: This is the initial cost at which the stock was bought. It represents the amount paid per share at the time of investment. The purchase price is a crucial input since it forms the baseline against which the sale price is compared to determine capital gains or losses.\n\n2. **Sale Price**: This is the price at which the stock is sold. It indicates the per-share amount received upon selling the stock. The sale price is compared to the purchase price to calculate the gain or loss from the investment. A higher sale price relative to the purchase price suggests a capital gain, whereas a lower sale price implies a capital loss.\n\n3. **Dividends Received**: These are the total dividends paid to the investor during the period the stock was held. Dividends are distributions of a portion of a company's earnings to its shareholders and are considered an integral part of the ROI calculation as they contribute directly to the investor's profit.\n\n#### Calculation:\n\nThe ROI is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROI} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{(Sale Price - Purchase Price) + Dividends Received}}{\\text{Purchase Price}} \\right) \\times 100 \\% \\]\n\nThis formula allows the investor to see the percentage return achieved on the stock, taking into account both the capital gain/loss and any additional income from dividends.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose an investor buys a stock for $100 per share.

Compounded interest is a method where the interest amount is added to the principal, and then the subsequent interest is calculated on the new total, which includes previously accumulated interest. This results in exponential growth of the investment or loan over time.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **Principal (P)**: This is the initial amount of money that is either invested or borrowed. It is the base amount on which interest will be calculated. This should be a non-negative number.\n\n2. **Interest Rate (r)**: This represents the percentage at which the principal amount earns interest over each compounding period. It is typically expressed as an annual rate in decimal form. For example, a 5% annual interest rate would be input as 0.05.\n\n3. **Period (n)**: The number of times that interest is compounded per year. This is usually a positive integer. Common compounding intervals include annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, daily, etc. The choice of compounding period significantly affects the amount of interest accrued over time.\n\n#### Return Value:\n\nThe function returns the total compounded amount after applying the interest for the given period. This amount consists of the original principal plus the accumulated interest.\n\n#### Formula:\n\nThe formula used to calculate the compounded interest is:\n\\[ A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt} \\]\nwhere:\n- \\( A \\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- \\( P \\) is the principal amount (the initial deposit or loan amount).\n- \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n- \\( n \\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per unit year.\n- \\( t \\) is the number of years the money is invested or borrowed", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"principal": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial principal."}, "interest_rate": {"type": "float", "description": "The annual interest rate."}, "period": {"type": "integer", "description": "The period in years."}, "compounding_frequency": {"type": "string", "description": "The frequency of compounding per year.

However, users must ensure that the commands are properly formatted and are compatible with the command line syntax of Windows. It is important to note that since `os.system()` operates by invoking the command as a subprocess, the behavior and output can differ based on the exact environment and command syntax used.

This method is more robust for complex scenarios because it allows for more sophisticated scripting capabilities, such as loop constructs, conditional statements, and error checking, providing greater control over the execution flow.\n\nHere is an example of using this function:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Example of executing a single command\nos.system('echo Hello World')\n\n# Example of executing multiple commands\nos.system('cd C:\\\\ && dir')\n\n# For complex tasks, write the commands to a .bat file and execute it\nwith open('task.bat', 'w') as file:\n    file.write('echo Hello\\n')\n    file.write('cd C:\\\\\\n')\n    file.write('dir\\n')\n\nos.system('task.bat')\n```\n\nIn this example, the first `os.system()` call demonstrates executing a single command, which simply echoes \"Hello World\" to the console. The second call shows how to execute two commands in sequence, using '&&' to change directory to the root of the C: drive and then listing the contents of that directory. The third example illustrates creating a batch file for more complex", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The Windows command line instruction(s) to be executed.

The `os.system()` function is a straightforward way to invoke a command in the system's command line interface. It is particularly tailored for use on Windows platforms, ensuring that the command is interpreted according to Windows' command syntax. \n\nIf there is a need to execute multiple commands sequentially, users should concatenate these commands with the '&&' operator.

This is a crucial feature for script automation where the success of each step depends on the successful completion of the previous one.\n\nHowever, when dealing with more complex tasks that require multiple commands or more advanced logic, it is advisable to create a batch (.bat) file. A batch file is a text file containing a series of commands intended to be executed by the command-line interpreter, which can offer greater flexibility and control compared to running commands directly through `os.system()`.

For complex tasks, create and run a .bat file.This function serves the purpose of executing a specified command string within a Windows operating system environment by utilizing the `os.system()` function from Python's standard library. The `os.system()` function is a straightforward way to run shell commands; it passes the command in the form of a string to the system shell for execution. It should be noted that this approach is particularly tailored for Windows OS users.\n\nWhen constructing the command string, if your task involves a sequence of multiple commands, it is crucial to separate these commands using the '&&' operator. This ensures that each command is executed in order, where subsequent commands are only executed if the preceding command completes successfully. For example, if you need to change directories and then list its contents, you would structure your command string like so: `\"cd example_directory && dir\"`. This ensures that the directory listing only occurs if the directory change operation is successful.\n\nHowever, for more complex or conditional operations that surpass the basic capabilities of `os.system()`, or if your command sequence becomes excessively lengthy, it is advisable to encapsulate these operations within a batch script (a .bat file). A batch file allows for a more robust and maintainable approach to script writing. Once the batch file is created, you can execute it using `os.system()` by passing the file's path as the command argument, such as `os.system(\"example_script.bat\")`.\n\nBear in mind that `os.system()` returns a status code, with a return value of zero typically indicating successful execution, while non-zero values denote various types of errors.

It is a critical factor, as greater distances typically result in higher emissions.\n\n2. **Fuel Type**: The type of fuel the vehicle uses significantly impacts the calculation. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, electric, and hybrid options. Each fuel type has a specific carbon emissions factor, which denotes the amount of carbon dioxide produced per unit of fuel consumed. This emissions factor is essential for accurately estimating the vehicle's carbon footprint.\n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency**: This represents how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel, usually expressed in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). Higher fuel efficiency indicates that the vehicle can travel further on a smaller amount of fuel, potentially reducing the total emissions.\n\n**Calculation Process:**\n\nThe function combines these parameters to estimate the annual carbon dioxide emissions.

The function operates by filtering movies based on three primary attributes: the director of the movie, the genre, and members of the cast. Each of these attributes plays a crucial role in the search query to ensure that the results align closely with the user's interests.\n\n#### Parameters:\n1. **Director**: The name of the director is a key parameter for this function. It allows the user to filter movies directed by a particular filmmaker, enabling them to explore a director's body of work or discover new films by a director they admire.\n\n2. **Genre**: This parameter allows the user to specify the type or category of movie they are interested in. Whether the user is in the mood for a comedy, drama, action, thriller, or any other genre, this filter ensures that the movies retrieved align with the specified genre preference.\n\n3. **Cast**: Users can specify one or more actors or actresses to filter movies featuring these cast members. This is particularly useful for fans of specific performers who wish to explore their filmography or discover new works they have participated in.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nSuppose a user wishes to find movies directed by \"Christopher Nolan,\" within the \"Science Fiction\" genre, and starring \"Leonardo DiCaprio.\" By inputting these criteria into the function, the user would receive a list of movies that match all these attributes, such as \"Inception.\" This ensures a highly personalized and relevant movie discovery experience.\n\n#### Considerations:\n- If a user specifies only one or two of the parameters, the function will still retrieve movies based on the available criteria, thereby offering flexibility in how the search is conducted.\n- In cases where no movies match all the criteria provided, the function should ideally return an empty list, indicating that no such films are found within the database or collection being queried.\n\nThis functionality is particularly useful", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": [], "properties": {"directed_by": {"type": "string", "description": "Director of the movie.

The primary purpose of this function is to handle raw fMRI data, which may consist of complex time-series information captured from brain scans, and apply various analytical techniques to extract meaningful insights. \n\n#### Input\n- **fMRI Data**: The function accepts fMRI data, which typically comprises three-dimensional or four-dimensional datasets that represent brain activity over time. This data is usually formatted in standard neuroimaging file formats, such as NIfTI or DICOM. The input may also contain metadata that provides additional context or information necessary for proper analysis.\n\n#### Process\n- The function employs a series of analytical methods to process the input data. These methods may include pre-processing steps such as motion correction, spatial normalization, and temporal filtering. The analysis may also involve statistical techniques to identify patterns of brain activity, connectivity assessments to examine neural networks, or machine learning approaches to classify or predict specific cognitive states or responses.\n\n#### Output\n- **Analyzed Data**: The result of the function is a set of analyzed data that provides insights into the brain's activity patterns. This output can be in the form of statistical maps, graphs representing neural connectivity, or other data visualizations that highlight significant findings. The analyzed data is typically ready for further interpretation by researchers or clinicians.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n- The function should handle cases where the input data is incomplete or contains artifacts that could affect analysis. It should be robust enough to manage variability in data quality and accommodate different scanning protocols or resolutions.\n\n#### Usage Example\n```python\n# Example usage of the function\nraw_fmri_data = load_fmri_data(file_path)\nanalyzed_results = analyze_fmri_data(raw_fmri_data)\ndisplay_results(analyzed_results)\n```\n\nThis function is essential for neuroscientists and researchers who require efficient and accurate", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"data_source": {"type": "string", "description": "The path where the data is stored."}, "sequence_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of fMRI sequence"}, "smooth": {"type": "integer", "description": "Spatial smoothing FWHM.

To calculate BMI, this function requires two primary parameters: weight and height.\n\n- **Weight**: This parameter should represent the individual's weight, typically measured in kilograms. It is crucial to ensure that the weight value provided is accurate and corresponds to the person's current body mass to obtain a precise BMI calculation.\n\n- **Height**: This parameter should denote the individual's height, commonly measured in meters.

They mentioned they've been into fantasy-type movies lately. I remember that the function Movies_3_FindMovies2 is designed for this kind of search. It allows specifying director, genre, and cast. Since the user is into something more fantastical, I should set the genre to 'Fantasy' or maybe 'Imaginative fiction' if that's an option. Wait, looking at the function's parameters, the genre has 'Fantasy' as an option, but not 'Imaginative fiction'. Hmm, maybe I should check if 'Imaginative fiction' is included. Oh, no, it's not listed. So, perhaps the closest option is 'Fantasy'. Alternatively, maybe the user can specify 'dontcare' for genre if they just want to filter by other criteria. But since they specifically mentioned 'Imaginative fiction', I might need to see if that's an option. If not, I'll have to proceed with 'Fantasy' as the closest match. Alternatively, I can set genre to 'dontcare' and let the function search without that constraint. But the user wants to focus on 'Imaginative fiction', so maybe I should look for that. Wait, checking the function's parameters, the genre enum doesn't include 'Imaginative fiction'. So, perhaps the user can't specify that exact genre. In that case, I might have to proceed without the genre filter or suggest that the function can't handle that exact genre. Alternatively, maybe the user can use 'dontcare' for genre and focus on other criteria. But the user specifically wants to filter by genre.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that the Big Five model includes five traits: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. The user provided four adjectives, so I need to map each to the appropriate trait.\n\n1. **Efficient**: This seems to relate to Conscientiousness, which is about being reliable, responsible, and organized. The user being efficient suggests they are thorough and organized.\n\n2. **Organized**: Again, this aligns with Conscientiousness. Being organized is a key aspect of this trait.\n\n3. **Easy Going**: This might point to Neuroticism, but wait, Neuroticism is more about emotional stability. Alternatively, it could relate to Agreeableness, which is about being cooperative and having good interpersonal skills. Since the user is described as easy going, which is more about approachability and tolerance for conflict, maybe it's Agreeableness.\n\n4. **Compassionate**: Compassion is typically linked to Agreeableness as well, as it involves a willingness to help others and have good interpersonal relations.\n\nWait, but the user only provided four characteristics, and the function requires a list of characteristics. So I need to make sure I cover all five traits. Maybe the user's traits are missing one. Let me think: efficient and organized cover Conscientiousness, easy going might be Neuroticism, and compassionate is Agreeableness. That leaves Openness. Openness is about thinking abstractly and having a wide range of interests. The user didn't mention anything about thinking deeply or having diverse interests, so perhaps they scored low on Openness.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's traits are more aligned with other aspects. Let me consider each trait:\n\n- **Openness**: Usually involves thinking abstractly, creativity, and being open to new ideas. The user didn't mention anything about thinking deeply or having a wide range of interests, so maybe a low score here.\n\n- **Conscientiousness**: High, as they are efficient and organized.\n\n- **Extraversion**: This is about being sociable and outgoing. The user is described as easy going, which could imply they are not overly outgoing, so maybe a medium score here.\n\n- **Agreeableness**: High, as they are compassionate and approachable.\n\n- **Neuroticism**: This is about emotional stability. The user is described as compassionate, which might suggest they are emotionally stable, so perhaps a low score here.\n\nWait, but the user is compassionate, which could imply they are emotionally stable, so Neuroticism might be low. Alternatively, if they are easy going, maybe they have a moderate score.\n\nI think I need to structure this properly. Let me list the traits and map the user's characteristics:\n\n1. **Conscientiousness**: High (efficient, organized)\n2. **Agreeableness**: High (compassionate)\n3. **Extraversion**: Medium (easy going)\n4. **Openness**: Low (no mention of abstract thinking or diverse interests)\n5. **Neuroticism**: Low (compassionate suggests emotional stability)\n\nSo, the function call would include these characteristics and the default scale, which is medium.\n\nWait, but the function requires the 'characteristics' array and 'scale' parameter. So I need to include all five traits in the characteristics array, even if the user didn't mention them. Alternatively, perhaps the user's traits are only four, so maybe the fifth trait is inferred or perhaps it's not provided.

By leveraging a combination of historical records and databases, the function aims to identify and return relevant data regarding the leader who was prominent or held significant influence in the specified area at the given time.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n- **Location (string):** This parameter represents the geographic area of interest. It should be provided in a format that the function can recognize, such as a city name, country, or region. The accuracy and specificity of the information retrieved will depend on the precision of the location input.\n\n- **Date (string):** This parameter should be a date in a recognizable format (e.g., \"YYYY-MM-DD\"). This date serves as a point of reference to determine which historical leader's information to retrieve. The date should ideally correspond to a time period when the specified location had a clear leader or ruling figure.\n\n#### Functionality\n\nUpon receiving the location and date inputs, the function conducts a search through historical data sources to pinpoint a leader associated with the given parameters. The search considers political, social, and historical contexts to ensure the leader identified is relevant to the time and area specified. The retrieved information typically includes, but is not limited to, the leader's name, title, significant achievements, and a brief overview of their historical impact.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\nSuppose a user wants to retrieve information about a leader in Paris on July 14, 1789. The function would take the inputs as `Location: \"Paris\"` and `Date: \"1789-07-14\"`. It would then return information about a leader such as King Louis XVI, who was the reigning monarch of France during that period, including relevant context about his role during the French Revolution.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n\n- **Ambiguous Locations or Dates:** If the location or date provided is ambiguous or corresponds to a period with multiple leaders or overlapping jurisdictions", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"location": {"type": "string", "description": "The country or region in question."}, "date": {"type": "integer", "description": "The year being queried."}, "title": {"type": "string", "description": "The official title of the position.

By leveraging the powerful search capabilities of Spotify, the function allows users to input a query that can include parts of the song title, artist name, album, or other related metadata. Upon receiving the query, the function initiates a search within Spotify's extensive music library to find the best match or list of matches that correspond to the user's input.\n\nOnce the function identifies the correct song from the search results, it proceeds to play the song through the Spotify platform. The function ensures that the song is played using the user's Spotify account, provided that the account is authenticated and has the necessary permissions to play music through the service.\n\n#### Parameter Explanation\n\n- **query**: The query parameter is a string that represents the search term or terms the user wishes to use to find a song on Spotify. This can be a fragment or complete song title, the artist's name, album name, or a combination thereof. The query should be formulated to maximize the accuracy of the search results.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\nSuppose a user wants to listen to \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by Queen. The user can call the function with the query parameter set to \"Bohemian Rhapsody Queen\" or simply \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" to search for the song. The function will then search Spotify's library, identify the track, and proceed to play it.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n\n- If the query does not correspond to any identifiable song, the function should handle this scenario gracefully, possibly by returning an error message or prompt indicating that no match was found.\n- If multiple songs match the query closely, the function may either play the first result or prompt the user to choose from a list of possible matches.\n- The function requires an active internet connection and a valid Spotify account with streaming permissions to function correctly.

It aims to provide a seamless experience for users by directly connecting their search inputs to Spotify's vast music library and initiating playback of the desired track.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **query (string):** A string that represents the search term or phrase used to find a song on Spotify. This could include the song title, artist name, album title, or any combination of these elements to increase the accuracy of the search results.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\nUpon receiving the query, the function interacts with Spotify's search API to locate a song that matches the terms provided by the user. The search is conducted in real-time, leveraging Spotify's powerful search algorithms to navigate through its extensive catalogue of music tracks, albums, and artists. Once a relevant match is found, the function proceeds to play the song immediately, allowing for an intuitive and efficient user experience.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Ambiguous Queries:** If the query can lead to multiple potential matches (e.g., common song titles or artist names), the function might select the most popular or most recent track by default, unless additional logic is implemented to refine the selection.\n\n- **No Results:** In instances where the search query does not return any results, the function should have a mechanism to handle this gracefully, possibly by notifying the user that no match was found, and suggesting alternative queries or corrections.\n\n- **Playback Restrictions:** Depending on the user's Spotify account type (free or premium) and regional restrictions, some functionality such as playback might be limited or unavailable. It is essential for the function to consider these limitations and provide appropriate feedback or fallbacks.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\n```python\n# Example usage of the search_and_play function\nsearch_and_play(\"Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the function would search Spotify for the song \"Bohemian Rhapsody\"", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["query"], "properties": {"query": {"type": "string", "description": "The search query for the song.

This number is a distinct sequence associated with the passenger's booking and is necessary to confirm their specific reservation details.\n\nThe function will process these inputs to check the status of the flight, which may include information such as whether the flight is on time, delayed, cancelled, or if there are any other pertinent updates affecting the flight. It is important for users to provide accurate and complete information for the function to retrieve the correct status efficiently.\n\nAn example use case might look like this: a passenger named \"John Doe\" with a ticket number \"XYZ567\" wants to check the status of flight \"AB1234.\" By providing these three pieces of information, the function can return the current status of the flight, allowing John to plan accordingly.\n\nEdge cases to consider include situations where the flight identifier, passenger's name, or ticket number are incorrect, incomplete, or do not match the records in the airline's database.

I remember that there's a function called flight.status.check1 which can help with this. Let me see what parameters I need to provide.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the function's requirements. The function requires 'airlines', 'person_name', and 'ticket_number'. Karan mentioned the airline is Indigo, so that's straightforward. The ticket number is given as IND4567, so that's covered too. But wait, the function needs the passenger's name. Karan didn't provide that. Hmm, the examples show that person_name can be either full name or first name. Since Karan didn't specify, maybe I can assume a name or check if the function can handle it without it. But looking at the function's description, it seems it requires the passenger's name as a parameter. So I might need to make an assumption here or perhaps the function can't proceed without it.\n\nWait, the examples provided for flight.status.check1 don't include a person_name, but in the description, it says the function requires the passenger's name. So I think I need to include it. Since Karan didn't provide it, maybe I can use a placeholder or perhaps the function can't be called without it. Alternatively, maybe the function can infer the name from the ticket number, but that doesn't seem likely. \n\nSo, perhaps I should inform Karan that the function requires the passenger's name and that without it, the check can't be performed. Alternatively, I can proceed by making an assumption, but that might not be accurate. It's better to ask for the missing parameter. \n\nWait, but the user hasn't provided the passenger's name. So, in the response, I should mention that the function requires the passenger's name and that it's necessary to include that parameter. Alternatively, if I can't proceed without it, I should let Karan know that the function can't be called as is.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I should call flight.status.check1 with the airlines as 'Indigo', the ticket_number as 'IND4567', and include the passenger's name. Since Karan didn't provide it, I need to prompt him to add that information. Alternatively, if I can't proceed without it, I should state that.\n\nWait, but the user is asking me to provide the function call.

This analysis is conducted based on two critical pieces of information: the building's unique identifier (Id) and the number of floors it comprises. By utilizing these parameters, the function provides insights into various structural aspects of the building, helping to assess its design and integrity.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **Id** (String/Integer): This parameter represents the unique identifier assigned to the building. It is crucial for distinguishing the building from others in the dataset and allows the function to retrieve and analyze specific data relevant to the building's structural attributes. The Id should be a value that accurately identifies the building within the system or database being used.\n\n- **Floor Numbers** (Integer): This parameter specifies the total number of floors present in the building. It is essential for evaluating the building's vertical structure and is a determinant in calculating load distributions, the building's stability, and other structural dynamics. The floor number must be a positive integer, as negative or zero values would not represent a valid physical building structure.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n```python\n# Example usage of the AnalyzeBuildingStructure function\nbuilding_id = \"B123\"\nfloor_count = 10\nanalysis_result = AnalyzeBuildingStructure(Id=building_id, FloorNumbers=floor_count)\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `AnalyzeBuildingStructure` is called with a building Id of \"B123\" and a floor count of 10. The function will then perform its analysis and return results that include insights into the structural integrity and characteristics of the specified building.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- **Invalid Id**: If an invalid or non-existent building Id is provided, the function should handle it gracefully, possibly by returning an error message or a null result indicating that the analysis could not be performed.\n\n- **Non-Positive Floor Numbers**: If the number of floors is zero or negative, the function should", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"building_id": {"type": "string", "description": "The unique identification number of the building."}, "floors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "integer"}, "description": "Floor numbers to be analyzed."}, "mode": {"type": "string", "description": "Mode of analysis, e.g. 'static' or 'dynamic'.

The function takes in three primary parameters: the chord progression, the number of measures, and the instrument selection.\n\n1. **Chord Progression**: This parameter requires an input of a sequence of chords, typically expressed in a standard musical notation format. The chord progression serves as the harmonic foundation over which the melody will be composed. The progression should be well-defined and structured to ensure a coherent musical output.\n\n2. **Number of Measures**: This parameter specifies the total length of the melody composition in terms of musical measures or bars. It determines how long the piece will last, with each measure typically consisting of a set number of beats depending on the time signature of the music. The melody will be constructed to fit exactly within this specified duration.\n\n3. **Instrument**: The instrument parameter defines which musical instrument the melody is intended for. It influences the timbre, range, and style of the melody, as different instruments have unique characteristics that affect how a melody is composed and perceived. Common choices include piano, guitar, violin, and flute, among others.\n\nIn executing this function, the user provides these three inputs, and the result is a melody that complements the provided chord progression, fits within the designated number of measures, and is suitable for performance on the specified instrument. This process involves algorithmically generating musical notes that adhere to the harmonic constraints of the chord progression while considering the practical range and expressive capabilities of the chosen instrument.\n\nFor example, if a user inputs a chord progression of C-G-Am-F, a measure count of 8, and selects a piano as the instrument, the function will compose an 8-measure melody that harmonizes with the C-G-Am-F progression, taking advantage of the piano's wide range and expressive dynamics to create an engaging musical piece.

They mentioned using the compose_melody function. Let me check the parameters required for that function. \n\nFirst, the function needs a progression, which is an array of chords. The user provided ['C', 'F', 'G'], but wait, that's only three chords. The example in the description shows a progression with four chords, like ['C', 'G', 'Am', 'F'] for four measures. So, maybe the user needs four chords for four measures. Alternatively, perhaps they just want three chords repeated or extended.\n\nLooking at the required parameters, the function expects a progression array, measures, and instrument. The user specified 4 measures and the instrument as Piano, which is the default. So, I should make sure the progression has four chords. \n\nWait, the user wrote \"progression of C, F and G\". That's three chords. Maybe they meant to have a four-chord progression. Alternatively, perhaps they want a three-chord progression repeated. But the example in the description uses four chords for four measures, so each chord corresponds to one measure. So, to make four measures, the progression should have four chords.\n\nSo, the user might have intended to provide four chords. Let me check the example again. The first example uses four chords for four measures, so each chord is one measure. Therefore, the user's progression should have four chords. \n\nThe user wrote ['C', 'F', 'G'], which is three. So, perhaps they made a typo. Alternatively, maybe they want a three-measure melody, but they specified four. Hmm. To be safe, I should ask for the correct number of chords. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function can handle any number of chords, but the example shows four. So, the user might need to adjust their input to have four chords. \n\nSo, the function call should have progression as ['C', 'F', 'G', 'something'], but the user didn't specify the fourth chord. Maybe they just want to use the three chords and repeat them or add another. Alternatively, perhaps they made a mistake and meant four chords. \n\nIn any case, the function requires the progression array, so I need to make sure it's correctly provided. Since the user provided three chords, but the example uses four, I should clarify. \n\nWait, the user's exact query is: \"Compose a simple piano melody with a progression of C, F and G for 4 measures.\" So, three chords for four measures. That might mean the progression is three chords, but the example shows four chords for four measures. So, perhaps the user wants a four-chord progression, but they only provided three. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the function can handle any number of chords, and each chord is one measure. So, the user can provide three chords for three measures, but they asked for four. So, perhaps they need to add another chord. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the function can handle any number of chords, and the user can specify how the progression is applied. For example, if the progression is shorter than the number of measures, it can repeat. \n\nBut in the example, the progression is four chords for four measures, so each chord is one measure. Therefore, the user's progression should have four chords. \n\nSo, the user's input is missing a fourth chord. They provided C, F, G. So, perhaps they intended to have a four-chord progression, but forgot the fourth. Alternatively, maybe they want to use a three-chord progression and have the melody repeat or something. \n\nBut since the function expects an array of chords, I should make sure the user provides the correct number. So, I should ask them to provide the fourth chord in the progression. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function can handle any number of chords, and the user can specify how the progression is applied. For example, if the progression is shorter than the number of measures, it can repeat. \n\nBut in the example, the progression is four chords for four measures, so each chord is one measure.

A key signature is a collection of sharps or flats that indicates the key of a piece of music, dictating which notes are to be consistently played as sharps or flats throughout the work. This function takes into consideration both major and minor scales, which are the two most common types of scales in Western music.\n\nFor a major scale, the key signature is determined based on the number of sharps or flats present, following the standard sequence used in Western music theory. For example, the key of C major has no sharps or flats, while G major has one sharp (F#), and F major has one flat (Bb).\n\nIn the case of a minor scale, the key signature is similarly determined, often by identifying its relative major key\u2014an approach where the minor scale shares the same key signature as its relative major. For instance, A minor, which is the relative minor of C major, also has no sharps or flats in its key signature.\n\nThis function is useful for musicians, composers, and music theorists who need to identify or verify the key signature of a given scale as part of their music analysis or composition work. It serves as a quick reference tool to ensure accurate recognition of the scale's key signature, facilitating both the understanding and the performance of music.\n\nThe function's input typically specifies the root note and the type of scale (major or minor), and it outputs the corresponding key signature in terms of the number and type (sharp or flat) of alterations.

A major key consists of seven distinct notes, and each note serves as the root for a potential chord. In the context of this function, the focus is on identifying and constructing the third major chord based on the tonal structure of the key provided.\n\nTo achieve this, the function first determines the scale notes specific to the given key. For example, in the key of C major, the scale notes are C, D, E, F, G, A, and B. The function then uses these notes to identify the root of the third chord in the sequence of diatonic chords. In a major scale, the third chord is typically a minor chord; however, this function specifically targets major chords in the key, which may require adjustments to align with the theoretical structure of major chord construction.\n\nThe function then constructs the chord by selecting the appropriate notes, typically the root, major third, and perfect fifth intervals from the scale. For instance, in the key of C major, while the third scale degree (E) forms an E minor chord, the function would adjust this to find the relevant major chord within the key.\n\nEdge cases include keys with sharps or flats, where the note selection must accurately reflect the key signature to ensure the correct chord is generated.

In the classic scenario, each die has six faces, numbered from 1 to 6, and the total possible outcomes for rolling two dice is 36, since each die operates independently. The function determines how likely it is to achieve a particular sum by considering the different combinations of numbers on the dice that can produce that sum.\n\nFor example, if you want to calculate the probability of rolling a sum of 7, you consider the combinations: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), and (6,1). There are six combinations that result in a sum of 7, making it the most common outcome when rolling two dice. To find the probability, the function divides the number of successful combinations by the total number of possible outcomes (36). Hence, the probability of rolling a 7 is 6/36 or 1/6.\n\nIt's important to note edge cases such as the smallest possible sum (2), which can only be achieved with the combination (1,1), and the largest sum (12), achieved with the combination (6,6). These sums have only one combination each, resulting in a probability of 1/36. This function is particularly useful for strategic decision-making in games by helping players understand the likelihood of certain outcomes based on the roll of the dice.\n\nTo use this function effectively, you input the desired sum, and it outputs the probability as a fraction or a decimal.

The evaluation process involves comparing the ranks and suits of the cards to ascertain which hand holds the highest value according to poker hand rankings, such as high card, pair, two pairs, three of a kind, straight, flush, full house, four of a kind, straight flush, and royal flush.\n\nAdditionally, this function handles ties by applying tie-breaking rules, such as comparing the highest cards in each hand, to ensure a clear winner is identified. In scenarios where multiple players have hands of identical rank, the function will further examine the specific values of the cards in each hand to decide the winner.

A full house is a hand consisting of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank, such as three 10s and two 8s. The calculation involves determining the number of ways to draw such a hand from a 52-card deck.\n\nTo achieve this, the function first calculates the number of ways to choose a rank for the three-of-a-kind portion of the hand, which can be done in 13 ways (one for each rank). For each chosen rank, there are \\(\\binom{4}{3}\\) ways to select three cards of that rank, since there are four suits in a deck.\n\nNext, the function calculates the number of ways to choose a different rank for the pair portion of the hand, which can be done in 12 ways (since one rank is already used for the three-of-a-kind). For each chosen rank for the pair, there are \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) ways to select two cards from the four available suits.\n\nThe total number of full house combinations is then given by multiplying these possibilities: \\(13 \\times \\binom{4}{3} \\times 12 \\times \\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nFinally, to find the probability, this total is divided by the total number of 5-card hand combinations from a 52-card deck, which is \\(\\binom{52}{5}\\).\n\nAn edge case to consider is ensuring the distinction between the rank chosen for the three-of-a-kind and the rank chosen for the pair, as they must be different.

It calculates the total time needed based on a standard cooking guideline to ensure the chicken is fully cooked and safe to eat. The function takes into account the weight of the chicken and uses a predetermined cooking formula to return the total cooking time.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **weight** (float or int): The weight of the chicken in pounds or kilograms. It is crucial that the weight is accurately provided, as the cooking time is directly proportional to this value. The function assumes that the weight is a positive number.\n\n#### Calculation Details:\nThe function typically employs a rule of thumb where the chicken is roasted at a standard temperature (e.g., 350\u00b0F or 180\u00b0C). For instance, a common guideline might be to cook the chicken for a baseline time of 20 minutes per pound, plus an additional 15 minutes for overall cooking. However, specific formulas may vary according to regional cooking standards or personal preferences, so it's important to adjust as needed.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- If the weight is extremely low (e.g., less than 2 pounds), the function should ensure that the calculated time does not fall below a minimum safe cooking threshold (e.g., 45 minutes), to ensure that the chicken is adequately cooked.\n- For unusually high weights, the function should account for variations in oven performance and potentially recommend checking the internal temperature of the chicken to confirm doneness.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n```python\ndef calculate_cooking_time(weight):\n    # Example guideline: 20 minutes per pound plus 15 minutes\n    time_per_pound = 20  # minutes\n    additional_time = 15  # minutes\n    total_time = (weight * time_per_pound) + additional_time\n    return total_time\n\n# Example usage:\nchicken_weight = 5  # pounds\ncooking_time = calculate_cooking_time(chicken_weight)", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"weight_kg": {"type": "float", "description": "The weight of the chicken in kilograms."}, "cooking_method": {"type": "string", "description": "The method of cooking, defaults to 'roast'."}, "temp_celsius": {"type": "integer", "description": "The cooking temperature in degrees celsius, defaults to 180."}}, "required": ["weight_kg"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\nTo determine the cooking time for a 1.5 kg roast chicken, we can use the `calculate_cooking_time2` function since it accepts the required weight_kg parameter and has default values for the other parameters.\n\n[calculate_cooking_time2(weight_kg=1.5)]", "possible_answer": [{"calculate_cooking_time1": {"weight_kg": [1.5], "cooking_method": ["", "roast"], "temp_celsius": ["", 180]}}, {"calculate_cooking_time2": {"weight_kg": [1.5], "cooking_method": ["", "roast"], "temp_celsius": ["", 180]}}, {"calculate_cooking_time3": {"weight_kg": [1.5], "cooking_method": ["", "roast"], "temp_celsius": ["", 180]}}]}

This is typically a string representing the desired time zone, such as \"America/New_York\", \"Europe/London\", or \"Asia/Tokyo\". The identifier should conform to the IANA time zone database standards to ensure compatibility and correctness.\n\n#### Return Value:\n\n- **Current Time**: The function returns the current time in the specified time zone. The time output is typically in a 24-hour format, but the exact format may depend on the implementation details of the function. The returned time is adjusted for any daylight saving time (DST) rules applicable to the specified time zone, ensuring accuracy.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nTo use the function, simply call it with the desired time zone identifier. For instance, if you want to retrieve the current time in New York, you would invoke the function with the argument \"America/New_York\". The function will process this input and return the current time in New York, taking into account any local time changes due to DST.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Invalid Time Zone**: If the provided time zone identifier is invalid or unrecognized, the function should handle this gracefully, possibly by returning an error message or a default time zone.\n  \n- **Daylight Saving Time Changes**: The function should automatically adjust for DST changes, which occur at", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"location": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the city."}, "country": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the country."}, "timezone": {"type": "string", "description": "The optional timezone to get current time.
