It requires the user to specify the restaurant from which they wish to order as well as the specific food items they intend to purchase, along with the corresponding quantities for each item. \n\n#### Parameters:\n- **Restaurant Selection**: The user must provide the name or unique identifier of the restaurant from which they want to order. This ensures that the function targets the correct establishment on the Uber Eats platform, thereby accessing the menu specific to that restaurant.\n  \n- **Items and Quantities**: The user should specify the exact menu items they wish to order. Alongside each item, the user must indicate the desired quantity. This involves creating a list or dictionary structure where each entry contains a menu item as the key and the quantity as the value, allowing for precise order customization.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nSuppose a user wants to order from the restaurant \"Joe's Burger Shack.\" They decide to order two cheeseburgers and one side of fries.

The calculation uses fundamental principles of physics, specifically the equations of motion under constant acceleration due to gravity.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **initial_height** (float): This parameter represents the initial height from which the object is dropped, measured in meters. It is crucial that this value is a positive number, as a negative height does not physically make sense in this context.\n\n- **gravity** (float, optional): This parameter represents the gravitational acceleration, typically measured in meters per second squared (m/s\u00b2). The default value is 9.81 m/s\u00b2, which is the standard acceleration due to Earth's gravity at sea level. This parameter allows for adjustments if the calculation is needed for different planets or conditions where gravity may vary.\n\n#### Description:\n\nWhen an object is dropped from rest (i.e., the initial speed is zero), it accelerates downwards under the influence of gravity. The final speed can be determined using the kinematic equation:\n\n\\[ v_f = \\sqrt{2gh} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( v_f \\) is the final velocity (in m/s),\n- \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity, and\n- \\( h \\) is the height (in meters) from which the object is dropped.\n\nThe function assumes ideal conditions where air resistance is negligible, allowing the object to accelerate uniformly. This simplification makes the computation straightforward and applicable for theoretical scenarios or environments where air resistance can be ignored.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose you wish to calculate the final speed of an object dropped from a tower that is 50 meters high. Using the default gravitational acceleration on Earth, the call to this function would be:\n\n```python\nfinal_speed = calculate_final_speed(initial_height=50)\n```\n\nThis would return", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"initial_velocity": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial velocity of the object."}, "height": {"type": "integer", "description": "The height from which the object is dropped."}, "gravity": {"type": "float", "description": "The gravitational acceleration.

The calculation is based on the principles of electromagnetism, particularly using Amp\u00e8re's Law and the Biot-Savart Law which describe how currents produce magnetic fields in their vicinity.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **distance_from_wire (float):** This parameter represents the perpendicular distance from the point of interest to the wire in meters. The distance should be a positive real number since it is not physically feasible to measure or define a distance in negative terms, and zero distance would imply the point is on the wire itself, where the magnetic field is theoretically infinite.\n  \n- **current_through_wire (float):** This parameter indicates the current flowing through the wire, measured in amperes (A). The current should be a real number, and it can be positive or negative, representing the direction of the current. The function assumes that the wire is straight and infinitely long, so edge effects and wire shape do not influence the result.\n\n#### Returns:\n- **magnetic_field_strength (float):** The function returns the magnitude of the magnetic field strength at the specified distance from the wire, expressed in teslas (T). The magnetic field strength is directly proportional to the current through the wire and inversely proportional to the distance from the wire.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nTo calculate the magnetic field strength at a point 0.1 meters away from a wire carrying a current of 5 amperes, you would call the function as follows:\n\n```python\nmagnetic_field_strength = calculate_magnetic_field_strength(distance_from_wire=0.1, current_through_wire=5)\n```\n\nThis function is particularly useful in scenarios involving the design and analysis of electrical circuits, where understanding the magnetic effects of currents is crucial.

An isothermal process is one that occurs at a constant temperature, meaning that the temperature of the system does not change during the process. A reversible process, on the other hand, is an idealized process that occurs infinitely slowly and can be reversed without leaving any change in either the system or the surroundings.\n\nIn the context of thermodynamics, entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system. For an isothermal and reversible process, the change in entropy (\u0394S) can be determined using the definition of entropy in relation to heat transfer. Specifically, the change in entropy is calculated using the formula: \u0394S = Q/T, where \u0394S is the change in entropy, Q is the amount of heat absorbed or released by the system, and T is the absolute temperature at which the process occurs, maintained constant throughout the process.\n\nThis function requires that the user input the values of Q, the heat exchanged, and T, the constant temperature, to compute the resulting entropy change. It is crucial to ensure that the temperature is given in an absolute scale, such as Kelvin, to avoid errors in the calculation. Furthermore, if the direction of heat transfer is into the system, Q should be positive, while if it is out of the system, Q should be negative, in accordance with the sign convention typically used in thermodynamics.\n\nAn example of using this function could be calculating the entropy change when 500 J of heat is added to a system at a constant temperature of 300 K. By substituting these values into the formula, the change in entropy would be calculated as follows: \u0394S = 500 J / 300 K, resulting in \u0394S = 1.67 J/K.\n\nOverall, this function is valuable for understanding how energy transformations impact the entropy of a system under the specific conditions of an isothermal and reversible process, which are common in theoretical studies and", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"initial_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial temperature in Kelvin."}, "final_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The final temperature in Kelvin."}, "heat_capacity": {"type": "integer", "description": "The heat capacity in J/K."}, "isothermal": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether the process is isothermal.

This calculation is particularly useful in scenarios requiring precise measurements of angles, such as graphical representations of clocks or mathematical problems involving time and angles.\n\n### Parameters:\n- **hour (int)**: The hour value from the given time, typically ranging from 0 to 23. If the hour is represented in a 12-hour format, it should be adjusted accordingly to fit within the 0-11 range for the calculation.\n- **minute (int)**: The minute value from the given time, ranging from 0 to 59. This value determines the position of the minute hand on the clock face.\n\n### Function Details:\nThis function computes the angle in degrees. The clock is considered circular, with 360 degrees representing a full rotation. A key aspect of the calculation is that the angle is measured in a clockwise direction from the hour hand to the minute hand. The result provided is the acute angle between the two hands, meaning the function always returns the smaller of the two possible angles.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- **Exactly on the Hour**: If the minute is 0, the minute hand is at the 12 o'clock position, and the hour hand's position is determined solely by the hour value.\n- **Same Hour and Minute**: If both hands overlap, such as at 12:00, the calculated angle will be 0 degrees.\n- **Maximum Separation**: At times like 6:00, the hands are diametrically opposite to each other, resulting in an angle of 180 degrees.\n\n### Usage Example:\nTo calculate the angle at 3:15:\n1. The hour hand is at a quarter past three, contributing to its position at 3/12 * 360 + 15/60 * 30 = 97.5 degrees.\n2.

It serves as a tool for organizing and categorizing customer interactions based on predefined classification criteria or categories, enabling better handling and analysis of customer service data.\n\n#### Functionality\n- **Purpose**: The primary goal of this function is to ensure that each customer query is associated with an appropriate classification. This process is crucial for maintaining an organized database of customer interactions, facilitating efficient query handling, and enabling data-driven insights into customer service performance.\n\n- **Input**: The function typically takes specific parameters that include the details of the customer service query. This can include information such as the query ID, customer details, and the classification category, which may be predetermined by an automated system or a customer service agent.\n\n- **Process**: Upon receiving the necessary input parameters, the function records the classification in a centralized system. This might involve updating a database or a CRM system with the classification details, ensuring that the query is stored under the correct category.\n\n- **Output**: The function does not necessarily return a value but ensures that the classification is stored correctly. Success or failure in recording the classification might be logged or signaled through a status message or a boolean indicator.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n- **Invalid Classification**: If a query is attempted to be classified into a category that does not exist or is invalid, the function should handle this gracefully, possibly by returning an error message or logging the incident for further investigation.\n\n- **Duplicate Queries**: In cases where the same customer query is attempted to be classified multiple times, the function should check for duplicates to prevent redundant data entries.\n\n- **Data Integrity**: The function must ensure the integrity and accuracy of the classification data, avoiding situations where queries are misclassified due to incorrect input parameters.\n\n#### Usage Example\nConsider a scenario where a customer service department receives a query related to billing issues.

The function takes advantage of the capabilities of models that have been trained on large datasets to understand the context and content of images in conjunction with textual data.\n\nUpon receiving the image and question, the function first ensures that both inputs are formatted correctly and compatible with the question-answering model being used. This might involve preprocessing steps such as resizing or normalizing the image and tokenizing the text question. Once the inputs are prepared, the function feeds them into the selected pre-trained model. These models, often based on neural networks like Vision Transformer (ViT) or others designed for visual understanding, are adept at interpreting visual data alongside text.\n\nThe function then leverages the model's ability to analyze and correlate elements within the image with the semantics of the question to derive an appropriate answer. The pre-trained model contains learned patterns and features from extensive training datasets, allowing it to infer answers with a degree of accuracy and reliability.\n\nAfter the model processes the inputs, the function retrieves the output, which is the model's predicted answer to the question.

The prediction process primarily relies on inputs that describe the house's physical characteristics and construction history. These inputs include:\n\n1. **Area**: This parameter represents the total square footage or square meters of the house. It is a crucial determinant of property value, as larger houses typically command higher prices due to the increased living space they offer.\n\n2. **Number of Rooms**: This input specifies the total number of rooms in the house. The number of rooms can directly affect a house's functionality and appeal, influencing its market value. Generally, houses with more rooms are more desirable and can fetch higher prices.\n\n3. **Year of Construction**: This parameter indicates the year in which the house was built. The age of a property can impact its value in various ways. Newer houses may have modern designs and require less maintenance, potentially increasing their value. Conversely, older houses might be valued for their historical significance or architectural style.\n\nBy considering these three factors\u2014area, number of rooms, and year of construction\u2014the function can provide an estimated market price for the house.

This function takes into account a series of future cash flows, a specified discount rate, and the initial investment amount to determine the present value of an investment. \n\nThe NPV function works by discounting each of the future cash flows back to their present value using the discount rate, which reflects the time value of money and investment risk. The initial investment amount is then subtracted from the sum of these discounted cash flows. A positive NPV indicates that the projected earnings, in present dollars, exceed the anticipated costs, thereby suggesting that the investment might be profitable. Conversely, a negative NPV suggests that the investment may result in a loss.\n\n### Parameters:\n- **Future Cash Flows**: This is an array or list of expected cash inflows from the investment over time. These cash flows are typically projected on a yearly basis, but they can also be broken down into other periods, such as quarters or months, depending on the specific analysis requirements.\n  \n- **Discount Rate**: This rate is used to calculate the present value of future cash flows. It accounts for the risk-free rate of return as well as any additional risk premium associated with the investment. The choice of an appropriate discount rate is critical, as it can significantly influence the NPV calculation.\n  \n- **Initial Investment**: This is the upfront cost or expenditure required to start the investment.

This value is crucial as it sets the baseline for all future growth calculations. The annual growth rate is expressed as a percentage, signifying the expected increase in the value of the investment for each year it is held.

It is important to note that this function assumes that the annual growth rate remains consistent over the entire holding period, enabling the application of compound interest calculations to determine the final projected return.\n\nThe formula used to calculate the projected return is based on the principle of compound interest, given by the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Projected Return} = \\text{Investment Amount} \\times (1 + \\frac{\\text{Annual Growth Rate}}{100})^{\\text{Holding Period}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- The Investment Amount is the initial sum of money invested.\n- The Annual Growth Rate is divided by 100 to convert the percentage into a decimal for calculation purposes.\n- The Holding Period is the number of years the money is invested.\n\nAn example of usage for this function could be as follows: if an investor places $10,000 into a stock with an anticipated annual growth rate of 5% and plans to hold the investment for 10 years, the function will calculate the projected return by plugging these values into the formula, resulting in a future value of approximately $16,288.95.\n\nIt is important for users of this function to ensure the accuracy of their inputs, particularly the investment amount and growth rate, as any errors in these values", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"investment_amount": {"type": "integer", "description": "The amount of money to invest."}, "annual_growth_rate": {"type": "float", "description": "The expected annual growth rate of the stock."}, "holding_period": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of years you intend to hold the stock."}, "dividends": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Optional.

This calculation is essential for understanding the environmental impact of a vehicle's operation over the course of a year. The function takes into account three primary factors to determine these emissions: the distance traveled by the vehicle, the type of fuel that the vehicle uses, and the fuel efficiency of the vehicle.\n\n1. **Distance Traveled**: This parameter represents the total number of miles or kilometers that the vehicle covers in a year. It is a crucial factor because the more a vehicle is driven, the more fuel it consumes, and consequently, the more emissions it produces.\n\n2. **Fuel Type**: The type of fuel used by the vehicle plays a significant role in the calculation. Different fuels have varying carbon content and therefore produce different amounts of carbon dioxide when burned. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, and alternative fuels like natural gas or electricity. Each of these fuels has a specific carbon dioxide emission factor, which is used in the calculation to ensure accurate results.\n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency**: Also known as fuel economy, this parameter measures how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel to cover a distance. It is typically expressed in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). A vehicle with higher fuel efficiency will consume less fuel over the same distance compared to a less efficient vehicle, thereby producing fewer emissions.\n\nThe function combines these parameters in a formula to determine the total annual carbon dioxide emissions for the vehicle. It is important to input accurate values for each parameter to ensure the validity of the calculation. This information can be beneficial for vehicle owners seeking to reduce their carbon footprint by understanding the emissions associated with their driving habits and vehicle characteristics.\n\n**Example Usage**:\n- A user can input the following: a vehicle that travels 15,000 miles annually, runs on gasoline, and has a fuel efficiency of 25 MPG.

It is essential to provide the correct airline name or code to accurately access the relevant flight information. \n- **passenger's name**: This parameter takes the full name of the passenger as it appears on the ticket. The name must match the records in the airline's database to identify the correct flight status.\n- **ticket number**: This parameter is the unique identifier for the passenger's booking. The ticket number typically consists of numeric or alphanumeric characters. It is crucial for distinguishing the specific booking from others and is used to access the precise details of the flight.\n\n### Functionality:\nUpon receiving the above parameters, the function communicates with the airline's database or a third-party flight information system to fetch the current flight status. The status may include information such as whether the flight is on time, delayed, canceled, or completed. Additionally, it might provide details on gate numbers, departure and arrival times, or any other relevant updates about the flight.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- If any of the parameters are incorrect or incomplete, the function may return an error or a message indicating that the flight status cannot be retrieved. It is important to ensure that all parameters are accurate and up-to-date.\n- The function assumes that the information provided is for a future or current flight; if the flight has already been completed, the status returned may indicate its completion.\n\n### Example Usage:\nSuppose a passenger named \"John Doe\" is flying with \"Airline XYZ\" and has a ticket number \"123456789\".

It is essential to ensure that input parameters are valid; the key should correspond to a recognized musical key (such as C major, A minor, etc.), and the number of chords should be a positive integer. Incorrect input could result in an inability to generate a meaningful progression or lead to unexpected results.\n\nAn example of usage could be calling the function with parameters set to 'C major' for the key and '4' for the number of chords, resulting in a progression suitable for a wide range of musical genres. This function is particularly useful for musicians, composers, and producers looking to automate or experiment with chord progressions in their projects.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"key": {"type": "string", "description": "The key for the chord progression."}, "chords": {"type": "integer", "description": "Number of chords in the progression."}, "progression_type": {"type": "string", "description": "The type of the chord progression.
