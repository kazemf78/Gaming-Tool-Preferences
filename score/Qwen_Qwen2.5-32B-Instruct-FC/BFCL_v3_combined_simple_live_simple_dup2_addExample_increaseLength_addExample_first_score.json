It accomplishes this by determining the positions of each hand relative to 12 o'clock and then computes the angle formed between them.\n\n### How the Function Works:\n1. **Input Parameters**: The function requires two input parameters representing the time of interest: \n   - `hour`: An integer value ranging from 0 to 23, representing the hour portion of the time. This allows for calculation in both AM and PM formats.\n   - `minute`: An integer value ranging from 0 to 59, indicating the minute portion of the time.\n\n2. **Position Calculation**:\n   - **Hour Hand Position**: The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours. Therefore, it moves 30 degrees per hour (360 degrees / 12 hours). Additionally, for every minute that passes, the hour hand moves 0.5 degrees (30 degrees / 60 minutes).\n   - **Minute Hand Position**: The minute hand completes a full circle, or 360 degrees, in 60 minutes. Hence, it moves 6 degrees per minute (360 degrees / 60 minutes).\n\n3. **Angle Calculation**:\n   - **Raw Angle**: The function first calculates the absolute difference between the angles of the hour and minute hands.\n   - **Minimal Angle**: Since the clock is circular, the function determines the smaller angle. This is done by taking the minimum between the raw angle and 360 degrees minus the raw angle, ensuring that the angle is always 180 degrees or less.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- **Exact hour**: If the minute is set to zero, the calculation must handle the scenario where the minute hand is at the 12 o'clock position, and the position of the hour hand is straightforwardly `hour * 30` degrees.\n- **Midnight and Noon**: These times are special cases", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"hours": {"type": "integer", "description": "The hour on the clock face."}, "minutes": {"type": "integer", "description": "The minutes on the clock face."}, "round_to": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of decimal places to round the result to, default is 2."}}, "required": ["hours", "minutes"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"calculate_clock_angle1": {"hours": 18, "minutes": 30}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"calculate_clock_angle1": {"hours": 18, "minutes": 30}}], "possible_answer": [{"calculate_clock_angle1": {"hours": [6], "minutes": [30], "round_to": ["", 2]}}, {"calculate_clock_angle2": {"hours": [6], "minutes": [30], "round_to": ["", 2]}}, {"calculate_clock_angle3": {"hours": [6], "minutes": [30], "round_to": ["", 2]}}]}

The function then records the association between each query and its intent, effectively classifying them in bulk. This method is particularly useful for applications that require organizing a large number of queries systematically, such as natural language processing tasks, chatbots, or automated customer service systems.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- If no queries are provided for a given intent, the function will simply record the intent with an empty list of queries, ensuring that all intents are processed but without any associated data.\n  \n- If duplicate queries are provided under the same intent, the function will still record each instance, as this might be intentional depending on the use case (e.g., tracking frequency of certain queries).\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\n# Example of how to call the function with multiple intents and their associated queries\nrecord_classifications(\n    greeting=[\"Hello\", \"Hi there\", \"Good morning\"],\n    farewell=[\"Goodbye\", \"See you later\", \"Take care\"],\n    inquiry=[\"What's the weather", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["acc_routing_start", "atm_finder_start", "faq_link_accounts_start", "get_balance_start", "get_transactions_start", "outofscope"], "properties": {"acc_routing_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries requesting the bank routing numbers or account numbers."}, "atm_finder_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for locations of ATMs, specified in the format of 'City, State (abbr)', such as 'Berkeley, CA' or 'New York, NY'."}, "faq_link_accounts_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to linking accounts within the bank's system."}, "get_balance_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for account balances, available funds, or other financial balances."}, "get_transactions_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to viewing transactions, deposits, purchases, and transaction details."}, "outofscope": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries that do not classify to any other available intents."}}}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"record2": {"outofscope": ["what is the weather like"]}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"record2": {"outofscope": ["what is the weather like"]}}], "possible_answer": [{"record1": {"acc_routing_start": [], "atm_finder_start": [], "faq_link_accounts_start": [], "get_balance_start": [], "get_transactions_start": [], "outofscope": [["what is the weather like"]]}}, {"record2": {"acc_routing_start": [], "atm_finder_start": [], "faq_link_accounts_start": [], "get_balance_start": [], "get_transactions_start": [], "outofscope": [["what is the weather like"]]}}, {"record3": {"acc_routing_start": [], "atm_finder_start": [], "faq_link_accounts_start": [], "get_balance_start": [], "get_transactions_start": [], "outofscope": [["what is the weather like"]]}}]}

The primary goal of this function is to interact with network management systems or APIs to extract information about the nodes, which can include switches, routers, or other networking devices, that are part of a particular fabric. \n\n### Parameters\n\n- **fabric_id**: This is a crucial parameter that uniquely identifies the fabric within the network for which the node information is being requested. It ensures that the correct set of nodes associated with the specified fabric is retrieved. It is important that this parameter is accurately provided in the request to avoid errors or retrieving data from an unintended fabric.\n\n### Usage Example\n\nWhen utilizing this function, it should be integrated into a system where network fabrics are managed, such as a data center configuration management tool or network orchestration service. Below is a hypothetical example of how this function might be called:\n\n```python\n# Assuming 'network_api_client' is an instance of a client capable of making HTTP requests\nfabric_id = \"fabric-12345\"\nnodes_list = network_api_client.get_nodes_by_fabric(fabric_id)\nprint(nodes_list)\n```\n\nIn this example, the function is expected to send a GET request, typically to a RESTful API endpoint, passing the fabric identifier as part of the URL or query parameters. The response, ideally in a structured format like JSON or XML, will contain the list of nodes associated with the specified fabric, which can then be processed or displayed according to the needs of the application.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- **Invalid Fabric ID**: If an incorrect or non-existent fabric ID is provided, the function may return an error response. It is essential to handle such cases by implementing error-checking mechanisms.\n  \n- **Network Errors**: Network issues, such as timeouts or connectivity problems, may prevent the successful execution of the GET request.

The NPV calculation is fundamental in financial analysis as it aids in determining the value of an investment by discounting future cash flows to their present value, thereby allowing for an assessment of profitability.\n\nTo perform this calculation, the function requires a series of cash flows, which are usually represented as a list or an array, where each element corresponds to a cash flow occurring at a specific time period. These cash flows may include both incoming cash, such as revenue, and outgoing cash, such as expenses or initial investments.\n\nThe function also requires an interest rate, often called the discount rate, which is a critical parameter in the NPV calculation. The discount rate reflects the time value of money, risk associated with the investment, and opportunity cost. It's used to discount future cash flows back to their present value, providing a comprehensive view of the project's worth today.\n\nFor each cash flow in the series, the function applies the formula for Net Present Value: NPV = \u03a3 (C_t / (1 + r)^t), where C_t represents the cash flow at time t, r is the discount rate, and t is the time period. This formula ensures that each future cash flow is appropriately adjusted for the time value of money.\n\nEdge cases to consider when using this function include scenarios where cash flows are zero or negative across all periods, which would result in an NPV of zero or a negative value, respectively.

The primary purpose of this function is to allow users to pass command-line instructions directly to the operating system for execution. It is particularly useful for automating tasks that would otherwise require manual input in a command prompt window.\n\nThe function can handle both single commands and multiple commands that are chained together using the logical AND operator, represented by '&&'. When multiple commands are chained with '&&', each command is executed sequentially, and execution only continues to the next command if the previous command completes successfully.

The calculation is based on three crucial parameters: the distance traveled by the vehicle in that year, the type of fuel the vehicle uses, and the fuel efficiency of the vehicle.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n1. **Distance Traveled**: This parameter represents the total number of miles or kilometers the vehicle has traveled in a year. It is a critical factor, as greater distances typically result in higher emissions.\n\n2. **Fuel Type**: The type of fuel the vehicle uses significantly impacts the calculation. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, electric, and hybrid options. Each fuel type has a specific carbon emissions factor, which denotes the amount of carbon dioxide produced per unit of fuel consumed. This emissions factor is essential for accurately estimating the vehicle's carbon footprint.\n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency**: This represents how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel, usually expressed in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). Higher fuel efficiency indicates that the vehicle can travel further on a smaller amount of fuel, potentially reducing the total emissions.\n\n**Calculation Process:**\n\nThe function combines these parameters to estimate the annual carbon dioxide emissions. It considers the distance traveled and divides it by the vehicle's fuel efficiency to determine the total fuel consumed over the year. This result is then multiplied by the carbon emissions factor associated with the selected fuel type to calculate the total emissions in terms of carbon dioxide.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n- If the distance traveled is zero, the function should correctly return zero emissions, as no travel means no fuel consumption or emissions.\n- If the fuel efficiency is excessively high, it could result in minimal emissions even for significant travel distances, which should be correctly processed.\n- Different fuel types with different emissions factors must be handled accurately to reflect real-world differences in carbon output.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\nSuppose a vehicle travels 15,000 kilometers in", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"distance": {"type": "integer", "description": "The distance travelled in miles."}, "fuel_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of fuel used by the vehicle."}, "fuel_efficiency": {"type": "float", "description": "The vehicle's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon."}, "efficiency_reduction": {"type": "integer", "description": "The percentage decrease in fuel efficiency per year (optional).

Additionally, if the date falls on a time change day, the conversion should respect local rules for daylight savings adjustments.\n\nParameters for this function typically include:\n\n1. `datetime`: The original time to be converted, represented as a datetime object.\n2. `source_tz`: A string or time zone object representing the original time zone of the datetime.\n3. `target_tz`: A string or time zone object representing the time zone to which the datetime should be converted.\n\nUsage Example:\nIf you need to convert a meeting time for participants located in different parts of the world, this function ensures that everyone receives the correct", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"time": {"type": "string", "description": "The local time you want to convert, e.g. 3pm"}, "from_timezone": {"type": "string", "description": "The time zone you want to convert from."}, "to_timezone": {"type": "string", "description": "The time zone you want to convert to."}}, "required": ["time", "from_timezone", "to_timezone"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"timezone.convert1": {"time": "3pm", "from_timezone": "EST", "to_timezone": "GMT"}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"timezone.convert1": {"time": "3pm", "from_timezone": "EST", "to_timezone": "GMT"}}], "possible_answer": [{"timezone.convert1": {"time": ["3pm"], "from_timezone": ["America/New_York", "New York", "NYC", "New York City"], "to_timezone": ["Europe/London", "London"]}}, {"timezone.convert2": {"time": ["3pm"], "from_timezone": ["America/New_York", "New York", "NYC", "New York City"], "to_timezone": ["Europe/London", "London"]}}, {"timezone.convert3": {"time": ["3pm"], "from_timezone": ["America/New_York", "New York", "NYC", "New York City"], "to_timezone": ["Europe/London", "London"]}}]}

It is particularly useful for applications that require time-sensitive operations or need to display time information based on the user's geographic location or a target region.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\n- **Purpose**: The primary purpose of this function is to determine the current time in a time zone that the user specifies. This is crucial for scheduling, logging events, or displaying time-relevant data accurately, especially in applications that operate across multiple time zones.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **Time Zone Identifier**: The function requires a time zone identifier as input. This is typically a string representing the desired time zone, such as \"America/New_York\", \"Europe/London\", or \"Asia/Tokyo\". The identifier should conform to the IANA time zone database standards to ensure compatibility and correctness.\n\n#### Return Value:\n\n- **Current Time**: The function returns the current time in the specified time zone. The time output is typically in a 24-hour format, but the exact format may depend on the implementation details of the function. The returned time is adjusted for any daylight saving time (DST) rules applicable to the specified time zone, ensuring accuracy.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nTo use the function, simply call it with the desired time zone identifier. For instance, if you want to retrieve the current time in New York, you would invoke the function with the argument \"America/New_York\". The function will process this input and return the current time in New York, taking into account any local time changes due to DST.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Invalid Time Zone**: If the provided time zone identifier is invalid or unrecognized, the function should handle this gracefully, possibly by returning an error message or a default time zone.\n  \n- **Daylight Saving Time Changes**: The function should automatically adjust for DST changes, which occur at", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"location": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the city."}, "country": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the country."}, "timezone": {"type": "string", "description": "The optional timezone to get current time.
