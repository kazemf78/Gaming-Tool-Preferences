It is crucial for the input to accurately match the recognized scientific or common name of the substance to ensure correct retrieval of data. For example, if you are interested in water, you would pass \"water\" as the argument.\n- **sea_level**: While the sea-level condition is typically implied, it is crucial to note that the boiling and melting points provided by this function are calibrated to standard atmospheric pressure found at sea level, which is approximately 101.3 kPa (kilopascals). This condition is important because atmospheric pressure can influence the boiling and melting points of substances.\n\n### Output\nThe function outputs two key values:\n1. **Boiling Point**: This is the temperature at which the substance transitions from a liquid to a gas at sea-level atmospheric pressure.

The absolute pressure is a crucial measurement in various scientific and engineering applications, as it represents the total pressure exerted on an object, including both the atmospheric pressure and the pressure measured by the gauge. The function works by taking the gauge pressure, which is the pressure relative to atmospheric pressure, and adding it to the atmospheric pressure to obtain the true or total pressure in absolute terms.\n\n### Parameters:\n- **gaugePressure** (float): This parameter represents the gauge pressure, typically measured using a pressure gauge. Gauge pressure is the pressure relative to the ambient atmospheric pressure and is often used in scenarios where the atmospheric pressure is a constant baseline. It is measured in units such as pascals (Pa), pounds per square inch (psi), or bars.\n  \n- **atmosphericPressure** (float): This parameter denotes the atmospheric pressure, which is the pressure exerted by the weight of the atmosphere above the point of measurement. It is essential for calculating absolute pressure and typically has a standard value of approximately 101.3 kPa at sea level. However, this value can vary based on altitude and weather conditions.\n\n### Returns:\n- **absolutePressure** (float): The function returns the absolute pressure, which is the sum of the gauge pressure and the atmospheric pressure.

Such processes are fundamental concepts in thermodynamics, often used in the analysis of idealized systems.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **Q**: The heat exchanged during the process, typically measured in joules (J). This parameter is crucial since, for an isothermal process, the entropy change is directly related to the heat transfer.\n- **T**: The absolute temperature at which the process occurs, measured in Kelvin (K). The temperature must remain constant throughout the process for the calculations to be valid. It is critical to ensure the temperature is given in Kelvin, as this is the standard unit in thermodynamics calculations.\n\n#### Details:\nIn the context of an isothermal and reversible process, the change in entropy (\\(\\Delta S\\)) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta S = \\frac{Q}{T}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\Delta S\\) is the change in entropy,\n- \\(Q\\) is the heat absorbed by the system,\n- \\(T\\) is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe function assumes that the process is carried out reversibly, which implies that the system remains in thermodynamic equilibrium throughout the process. This is an idealization that allows for the calculation of entropy changes without additional entropy generation, which would occur in irreversible processes.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- **Zero Heat Exchange**: If \\(Q = 0\\), the entropy change \\(\\Delta S\\) will be zero, indicating no change in the system's disorder.\n- **Negative Heat Exchange**: If the system releases heat (i.e., \\(Q\\) is negative), the entropy change will be negative, signifying a decrease in the system's entropy.\n\n#### Example Usage:\nImagine a scenario where a system absorbs 500 J of heat at a constant temperature of", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"initial_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial temperature in Kelvin."}, "final_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The final temperature in Kelvin."}, "heat_capacity": {"type": "integer", "description": "The heat capacity in J/K."}, "isothermal": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether the process is isothermal.

Conversely, when sorting in descending order, the elements are ordered from the largest to the smallest. This function can handle various types of data within the list, such as numbers or strings, provided that the data types are consistent and comparable. \n\nTo utilize the function, the user typically needs to specify the list to be sorted, and potentially an additional parameter to indicate the desired order type.

It is crucial that both pieces of information are accurately provided to ensure the correct song is located and played.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **songTitle**: A string representing the exact title of the song you wish to play. This parameter is case-sensitive and must match the song title in the database or music library.\n  \n- **artistName**: A string indicating the name of the artist who performs the song. This parameter should accurately reflect the artist's name as it appears in the music library, being mindful of any special characters or particular stylizations.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\nUpon receiving both the `songTitle` and `artistName`, the function searches the database for an exact match. If a match is found, the song playback is initiated. If no match is found, the function will typically return an error message or an indication that the song could not be located. \n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nTo play the song \"Shape of You\" by the artist \"Ed Sheeran\", you would call the function as follows:\n\n```python\nplay_song(\"Shape of You\", \"Ed Sheeran\")\n```\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Case Sensitivity**: Ensure the correct capitalization of the song title and artist's name to avoid mismatches.\n- **Multiple Versions**: If multiple versions of the same song by the artist exist, additional parameters or specifications may be needed to select the correct version.\n- **Artist Collaborations**: In cases where the song features multiple artists, specify the primary artist associated with the version you want to play.\n\nOverall, this function is essential for users wanting to enjoy specific tracks from their favorite artists, provided they enter the correct song title and artist name.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["artist_name", "song_name"], "properties": {"artist_name": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the artist whose song is to be played."}, "song_name": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the song to be played."}}}}, {"name": "play_song2", "description": "Plays the specified song by the given artist.Executes playback of the designated song by the specified artist.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["artist_name", "song_name"], "properties": {"artist_name": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the artist whose song is to be played."}, "song_name": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the song to be played."}}}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"play_song1": {"artistName": "K\u00e4\u00e4rij\u00e4", "songTitle": "Cha Cha Cha"}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"play_song1": {"artistName": "K\u00e4\u00e4rij\u00e4", "songTitle": "Cha Cha Cha"}}], "possible_answer": [{"play_song1": {"artist_name": ["K\u00e4\u00e4rij\u00e4"], "song_name": ["Cha Cha Cha"]}}, {"play_song2": {"artist_name": ["K\u00e4\u00e4rij\u00e4"], "song_name": ["Cha Cha Cha"]}}, {"play_song3": {"artist_name": ["K\u00e4\u00e4rij\u00e4"], "song_name": ["Cha Cha Cha"]}}]}

By doing so, it aids in streamlining the process of addressing customer needs and optimizing service efficiency.\n\n### Parameters:\n- **queries**: A list or collection of banking-related queries that need to be categorized. Each query typically involves customer concerns or requests related to banking services, such as account information, transaction issues, or loan inquiries.\n\n- **categories**: A predefined set of categories used to classify the queries. These categories might include topics like \"Account Management,\" \"Loans,\" \"Credit Cards,\" \"Fraud Detection,\" \"Transaction Disputes,\" and \"Online Banking,\" among others.\n\n### Functionality:\n- The function processes each query individually and assigns it to the most appropriate category from the list of predefined categories. This categorization process could involve keyword matching, natural language processing, or other heuristic methods to determine the best fit for each query.\n  \n- Once a query is categorized, it is recorded in a structured data format, such as a database or a log file, which allows for easy retrieval, analysis, and reporting. This enables the organization to track the frequency and types of queries received over time, providing insights into customer needs and service performance.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- Queries that do not fit neatly into any existing category may be flagged for further review or assigned to a general category. It\u2019s important for the function to handle such cases gracefully to maintain the integrity of the categorization process.\n\n- The function should also accommodate updates to the list of categories, allowing for the addition of new categories or refinement of existing ones as banking services and customer concerns evolve.\n\n### Example:\nConsider a scenario where a customer submits a query about a recent fraudulent transaction detected in their account:\n\n```python\nquery = \"I noticed an unauthorized transaction on my account.

By using this function, users can maintain an organized and easily accessible record of how each query is categorized, which can be crucial for analytics, reporting, and improving customer service processes.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **query_id**: A unique identifier for each customer service query. This parameter ensures that each query can be distinctly recognized in the database.\n  \n- **classification**: The category or type assigned to the query. This could include classifications such as 'Billing Issue,' 'Technical Support,' 'General Inquiry,' among others. Accurate classification is essential for effective query management and analysis.\n\n- **timestamp**: A record of the date and time when the classification was made. This helps in tracking the response and resolution times.\n\n#### Returns:\n\nThe function returns a confirmation message or a status code indicating whether the classification recording was successful. It may provide feedback such as 'Success,' 'Error: Invalid Query ID,' or 'Error: Undefined Classification' to inform users of the result of the operation.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose a customer service query with the ID `12345` needs to be classified as a 'Technical Support' issue. The function call might look like this:\n\n```python\nrecord_classification(query_id=12345, classification='Technical Support')\n```\n\nUpon successful execution, the query is logged under the specified classification, ensuring that subsequent analysis or follow-ups can be conducted efficiently. This also aids in trend analysis to pinpoint common customer issues.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Invalid Query ID**: If an unknown or invalid `query_id` is provided, the function should ideally handle this by returning an appropriate error message or status code.\n  \n- **Undefined Classification**: If the classification parameter does not match any pre-defined categories, the function should either prompt for correction or allocate the query to a default 'Uncategorized' group, depending on", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["money_movement_start", "get_transactions_start",

It is typically provided as a decimal, where a 5% return would be input as 0.05. The yield rate is crucial as it directly influences the growth of the investment over time.\n\n2. **Investment Amount**: This is the initial sum of money that is invested in the mutual fund. It represents the principal amount upon which the returns will be calculated. The investment amount is essential for determining the scale of the potential returns, with larger investments leading to proportionately higher estimated returns, assuming the same yield rate and time period.\n\n3. **Time Period**: This parameter specifies the duration, usually in years, for which the investment is held in the mutual fund. The time period impacts the compounding effect, where longer durations typically result in greater overall returns due to the exponential growth facilitated by compounding interest.\n\nThe calculation process assumes the concept of compound interest, where the returns are reinvested and generate their own returns over time.

These multiple commands can be chained together using the logical AND operator `&&`, which ensures that each command in the sequence is executed in the order provided, but only if the preceding command completes successfully without any errors. For example, if one command fails, the subsequent commands in the chain will not be executed. This behavior can be particularly useful for scripting tasks that require several operations to be performed in sequence, where each step is contingent upon the success of the previous one.\n\nThe `os.system()` function is a straightforward way to interact with the underlying system shell from a Python script, providing a bridge between Python and the Windows command line interface. It takes a single string argument, which is the command line to be executed. This means that commands must be formatted as they would be when typed directly into the Windows command prompt. Since `os.system()` calls the standard shell, the commands can include any executable or script available in the shell's environment, such as built-in commands or external programs.\n\nA typical usage example might involve executing a simple command like 'dir' to list directory contents or a more complex series of commands like 'mkdir new_folder && cd new_folder && echo \"This is a test\" > test.txt', which creates a directory, navigates into it, and creates a text file with some content. It is important to ensure that any command or series of commands passed to this function is correctly formatted and logically valid, as `os.system()` does not provide detailed error messages or exceptions beyond the exit status of the shell.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

It is particularly tailored for use within Windows operating systems. The `os.system()` function allows you to run shell commands directly from your Python script. When you have a single command to execute, you can pass it as a string argument to the function.

A batch file allows for more sophisticated command sequences, as it supports conditional operations, looping constructs, and easier debugging. You can write your commands into a .bat file and then execute this file using the same `os.system()` function. This approach not only organizes your commands more neatly but also makes it easier to maintain and modify the task script.\n\nHere's a basic usage example: If you want to create a directory and then navigate into it, you could use the command string `\"mkdir new_folder && cd new_folder\"`.

This function is particularly useful for applications involved in financial transactions, currency conversion, or any domain where the current value of one currency against another is required. \n\n### Parameters:\n- **base_currency (str)**: This parameter represents the three-letter currency code (such as \"USD\" for the United States Dollar) which acts as the base currency in the exchange rate.\n- **target_currency (str)**: This parameter denotes the three-letter currency code (such as \"EUR\" for the Euro) which acts as the target currency in the exchange rate.\n\n### Functionality:\nUpon invocation, the function queries an up-to-date financial data source or API, such as a central bank database or a market exchange service, to gather the latest exchange rate. It is important that both the `base_currency` and `target_currency` are specified in the standard ISO 4217 currency code format to ensure accurate retrieval.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- The function will handle cases where the specified currencies are not available by returning an error message or a predefined default, alerting the user to the unavailability of exchange rate data for the requested currencies.\n- Network issues or data source unavailability will result in a handled exception, providing an informative message to the user about the failure to retrieve the exchange rate.\n\n### Usage Example:\n```python\n# Example of using the function to get the exchange rate between USD and EUR\nexchange_rate = retrieve_latest_exchange_rate('USD', 'EUR')\nprint(f\"The latest exchange rate from USD to EUR is {exchange_rate}\")\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how the function can be implemented to acquire the exchange rate between the US Dollar and the Euro, showcasing its practical application in a real-world scenario.
