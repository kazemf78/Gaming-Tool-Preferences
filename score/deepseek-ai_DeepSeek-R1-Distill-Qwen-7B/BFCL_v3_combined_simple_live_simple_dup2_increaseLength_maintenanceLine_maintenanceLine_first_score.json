Similar to the first integer, this can be positive, negative, or zero.\n\n### Considerations:\n- If either of the integers is zero, the function returns the absolute value of the non-zero integer, because any number is a divisor of zero, but zero itself is not considered a common divisor unless both inputs are zero.\n- If both integers are zero, the function might be defined to return zero, though this is a special case that depends on the specific implementation, as mathematically, the GCD is not defined for two zero values.\n\n### Example Usage:\n```python\ngcd_value = compute_gcd(48, 18)\nprint(gcd_value)  # Output will be 6, which is the largest number that divides both 48 and 18 without a remainder.\n\ngcd_value = compute_gcd(-48, -18)\nprint(gcd_value)  # Output will again be 6, since the GCD is always a non-negative integer.\n\ngcd_value = compute_gcd(0, 5)\nprint(gcd_value)  # Output will be 5, as any number is a divisor of 0.\n\ngcd_value = compute_gcd(0, 0)\nprint(gcd_value)  # Depending on implementation, this may return 0 or raise an error, as GCD(0,", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"number1": {"type": "integer", "description": "The first integer."}, "number2": {"type": "integer", "description": "The second integer."}}, "required": ["number1", "number2"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\n[{'func_name1': 'number_theory.gcd1', 'params_name1': 'number1', 'params_value1': '36', 'params_name2': 'number2', 'params_value2': '48'}]", "possible_answer": [{"number_theory.gcd1": {"number1": [36], "number2": [48]}}, {"number_theory.gcd2": {"number1": [36], "number2": [48]}}, {"number_theory.gcd3": {"number1": [36], "number2": [48]}}]}

Specifically, it determines the final velocity by using the object's initial velocity, the constant acceleration it experiences, and the time duration over which this acceleration is applied. The formula used for this calculation is derived from the basic equations of motion in physics.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **Initial Velocity (v\u2080)**: This parameter represents the velocity of the object at the starting point of observation. It is usually given in meters per second (m/s) or any other unit of velocity. It is crucial to provide this value accurately as it serves as the baseline for computing how the speed of the object changes over time.\n\n- **Acceleration (a)**: Acceleration is the rate at which the velocity of the object changes over time. It is a vector quantity, which means it has both magnitude and direction. Acceleration is measured in meters per second squared (m/s\u00b2). Positive acceleration indicates an increase in velocity, while negative acceleration (deceleration) suggests a decrease.\n\n- **Time (t)**: This is the duration for which the acceleration is applied to the object. It is usually expressed in seconds (s). Time is a scalar quantity, solely representing the period over which the change in motion is observed.\n\n#### Formula:\nTo compute the final velocity (v), the function applies the formula:\n\\[ v = v\u2080 + (a \\times t) \\]\nThis equation assumes that the acceleration is constant over the time period specified.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nSuppose an object starts with an initial velocity of 10 m/s, accelerates at a rate of 2 m/s\u00b2 for 5 seconds. The final velocity can be calculated as follows:\n- **Initial Velocity (v\u2080)**: 10 m/s\n- **Acceleration (a)**: 2 m/s\u00b2\n- **Time (t)**:", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"initial_velocity": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial velocity of the object in meters/second."}, "acceleration": {"type": "integer", "description": "The acceleration of the object in meters/second^2."}, "time": {"type": "integer", "description": "The time over which the acceleration is applied in seconds."}}, "required": ["initial_velocity", "acceleration", "time"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\nTo calculate the final velocity of the vehicle, we can use the `final_velocity1` function with the provided parameters.

The acceleration due to gravity is considered as -9.81 m/s^2The function is designed to calculate the final speed of an object that is in free fall, specifically considering the scenario where air resistance is negligible and does not affect the object's motion. In this context, the object is assumed to be falling under the sole influence of gravitational force.\n\nThe gravitational acceleration is consistently applied as -9.81 meters per second squared (m/s\u00b2), which is the standard acceleration due to gravity on Earth's surface. The negative sign indicates that the acceleration is directed downward, towards the center of the Earth. This value is crucial for the calculations as it defines the rate at which the velocity of a freely falling object increases over time.\n\nTo compute the final speed, the function will typically take the time duration as an input parameter. This time parameter represents the period during which the object has been in free fall. It is important to ensure that the input for time is a non-negative value, as negative time would not be physically meaningful in this context.\n\nThe final speed is determined using the formula: final speed = initial speed + (acceleration due to gravity \u00d7 time). In scenarios where the object is initially at rest, the initial speed would be zero, simplifying the equation to final speed = -9.81 m/s\u00b2 \u00d7 time. However, if the object already has some initial velocity when it begins to fall, this velocity must be included in the computation.\n\nAn example of usage for this function might involve calculating the speed of an object after it has been falling for 5 seconds. Assuming it starts from rest, the calculation would yield a final speed of -49.05 m/s (since -9.81 m/s\u00b2 \u00d7 5 s = -49.05 m/s).

This data is retained for a duration of 7 days.This function provides the capability to list the exports associated with a bot, a specific bot locale, or a custom vocabulary within the Amazon Lex service. When you use this function, you can access detailed information about each export that has been created. It is important to note that the export data generated through this function is stored temporarily and is retained for a maximum period of 7 days. After this period, the data will no longer be available, so it is crucial to access and utilize the export information within this timeframe.\n\n### Parameters:\n\n1. **Bot ID (Optional):** \n   - This parameter specifies the unique identifier of the bot whose exports you want to list. If not provided, the function may default to listing exports associated with all available bots.\n\n2. **Bot Locale (Optional):** \n   - Refers to the specific language or locale of the bot for which you want to list exports. Providing this parameter allows you to narrow down the exports to those associated with the designated locale.\n\n3. **Custom Vocabulary (Optional):** \n   - This parameter indicates whether the exports are linked to a custom vocabulary component within the bot. It is useful when the exports are specifically related to custom defined vocabulary elements.\n\n### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose you are managing a multilingual bot with different locales and custom vocabularies, and you want to list all the exports for the English language locale. You would specify the bot ID and the English locale in the function call. This ensures that you retrieve only the relevant export data associated with the specified locale, which would be available for review or download for up to 7 days.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n\n- Attempting to list exports after the 7-day retention period will result in no data being available, as the export information would have been purged.\n- If both bot ID and locale are unspecified, the function may return an exhaustive list of all exports across various bots and locales, depending on the default behavior of the API.\n\nIn summary, this function", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["botId", "botVersion"], "properties": {"botId": {"type": "string", "description": "The unique identifier for the bot as assigned by Amazon Lex."}, "botVersion": {"type": "string", "description": "The specific version of the bot for which to list the exports."}, "sortBy": {"type": "string", "description": "Determines the field to sort the list of exports by.

This scenario simplifies the problem by eliminating drag forces, allowing us to focus solely on the effects of gravity. The calculation typically involves using the fundamental principles of classical mechanics, specifically the laws of motion and energy conservation.\n\nTo determine the final speed, the function employs the gravitational acceleration constant, typically denoted as \\( g \\), which has an approximate value of 9.81 meters per second squared (m/s\u00b2) on the surface of the Earth. The formula used in this calculation is derived from the conservation of energy, where the initial potential energy at the given height is converted into kinetic energy as the object falls.\n\nThe final speed (\\( v_f \\)) can be computed using the equation:\n\n\\[ v_f = \\sqrt{2gh} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( v_f \\) is the final speed of the object in meters per second (m/s),\n- \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity, approximately 9.81 m/s\u00b2,\n- \\( h \\) is the height from which the object is dropped, measured in meters (m).\n\nEdge Cases and Considerations:\n- If the height (\\( h \\)) is zero, the object does not fall, and the final speed will consequently be zero.\n- Negative values for height do not physically make sense in this context and should be handled as invalid input.\n- The function assumes the initial velocity of the object at the height is zero since it is dropped from rest.\n\nExample Usage:\nImagine you want to calculate the speed of a rock just before it hits the ground when dropped from a 10-meter-high cliff.

The function connects to a publicly accessible database that houses a vast collection of DNA sequences, making it possible to access genetic information associated with the given id.\n\nUpon invocation, the function queries the database, searching for the entry that corresponds to the provided id. This id should be formatted as specified by the database guidelines, ensuring it matches an existing record within the database. Once the correct record is identified, the function extracts the complete nucleotide sequence associated with the DNA molecule.\n\nThe sequence is returned in a standard format, typically as a string composed of the characters A, T, C, and G, which represent the four nucleotide bases of DNA: adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine.

The purpose of this function is to facilitate tracking and further processing of tasks or activities that need to be completed. This is particularly useful in project management, personal task tracking, or any scenario where organizing tasks into a list is beneficial.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **item**: The item to be added to the to-do list. This could be a string representing a task description, such as \"Buy groceries\" or \"Finish project report.\" The item should clearly and concisely describe the task so that it can be easily understood and acted upon later.\n\n- **toDoList**: The list to which the new item will be added. This must be a mutable data structure, typically an array or list, depending on the programming language being used. The list is expected to maintain its order, with the new item typically added to the end to reflect the sequence in which tasks are added or discovered.\n\n#### Function Behavior:\n- **Adding the Item**: When an item is added to the to-do list, it becomes part of the list's collection of items. This enables users to view all tasks needing attention, facilitating effective task management.\n\n- **Tracking and Processing**: Once the item is part of the to-do list, it can be tracked over time. Tracking involves periodically checking the list to ensure tasks are not forgotten. Further processing could involve marking the item as complete, prioritizing it amongst other tasks, or removing it from the list once it's no longer relevant.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- **Duplicate Items**: The function does not inherently prevent duplicate entries. If the same item is added more than once, it will appear multiple times in the list unless additional logic is implemented to check for and handle duplicates.\n\n- **Empty Strings or Null Values**: Adding an item with an empty string or a null value may not be meaningful.

This function focuses on the final step of this process\u2014the retrieval of the protein itself, which is essential for understanding the gene's role in biological processes and functions.\n\nWhen using this function, it may require the input of specific information about the gene whose protein sequence you wish to retrieve. This could include a gene identifier or symbol, which uniquely specifies the gene of interest within the human genome. The function then typically interacts with genomic databases or similar resources to obtain the accurate protein sequence.\n\nUnderstanding the protein sequence is critical in various fields such as genetics, molecular biology, and biomedical research, because proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms. These functions include catalyzing metabolic reactions, replicating DNA, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules. Thus, this function is a valuable tool for researchers who aim to study protein structures, investigate genetic mutations, or identify potential targets for drug development.\n\nIn edge cases, if the gene does not encode a protein (such as some non-coding RNA genes), or if the gene is not present in the database being queried, the function may return an error or a null result, indicating that no protein sequence could be retrieved. Therefore, it is important to ensure the gene of interest is indeed a protein-coding gene and that it is cataloged in the database used by this function.\n\nIn summary, this function serves as an integral part of genetic analysis by providing access to the protein sequence encoded by a specific human gene, thereby facilitating deeper insights into gene function and its implications in human health and disease.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"gene": {"type": "string", "description": "The human gene of interest."}, "species": {"type": "string", "description": "The species for which the gene is to be analyzed.", "default": "Homo sapiens"}}, "required": ["gene"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\n[get_protein_sequence1({'gene': 'BRCA1', 'species': 'Homo sapiens'})]", "model_result_decoded": [{"get_protein_sequence1": {}}], "possible_answer": [{"get_protein_sequence1": {"gene": ["BRCA1"], "species": ["Homo sapiens", ""]}}, {"get_protein_sequence2": {"gene": ["BRCA1"], "species": ["Homo sapiens", ""]}}, {"get_protein_sequence3": {"gene": ["BRCA1"], "species": ["Homo sapiens", ""]}}]}

The user can define the exact number of nucleotides, thereby controlling the sequence's overall length, which is an important feature when simulating DNA for various applications in bioinformatics, genetics research, or educational purposes.\n\nIn addition to setting the length, the function provides the option to specify a nucleotide preference. This means that users can influence the likelihood of each nucleotide appearing in the sequence. For instance, if a user desires a sequence with a higher occurrence of adenine, they can adjust the preference settings to reflect this preference. The nucleotide preference is typically defined as a probability distribution across the four nucleotides, summing to one, which dictates how frequently each nucleotide is expected to occur within the generated sequence.\n\nUsage Example:\nSuppose a user wants to generate a sequence of 100 nucleotides with an increased frequency of adenine. They might set the length parameter to 100 and define the nucleotide preference as 0.4 for adenine, 0.2 for each of cytosine and guanine, and 0.2 for thymine.

The timeframe parameter allows users to define the period over which they want to assess the evolutionary rate, providing flexibility in analysis from short-term changes to long-term evolutionary trends.\n\nTo use this function effectively, the user must input the specific species for which they want to predict the evolutionary rate.

Conversely, for descending order, the elements will be sorted from the largest to the smallest value. By default, if no specific order is indicated, the function will typically sort the list in ascending order. \n\nThe function is versatile and can handle lists containing various comparable data types, such as numbers, strings, or other sortable objects. However, it is important to ensure that all elements within the list are of compatible types to avoid runtime errors. For example, attempting to sort a list containing a mix of strings and numbers may lead to unexpected behavior unless explicitly handled.\n\nTo use this function effectively, users should pass the list they wish to sort as the primary argument. Additionally, they can specify a boolean parameter to indicate the desired sorting order. A 'true' value for this parameter will typically denote ascending order, while a 'false' value will specify descending order, although the exact implementation may vary.\n\nHere is a usage example for clarity:\n\n```python\nmy_list = [4, 1, 3, 5, 2]\nsorted_list = sort_list(my_list, ascending=True)  # Sorts in ascending order: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nsorted_list_descending = sort_list(my_list, ascending=False)  # Sorts in descending order: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n```\n\nIn this example, `sort_list` is the function being utilized to order `my_list`.

The goal of constructing a linear regression model is to determine the best-fitting linear relationship between these predictor variables and the target variable.

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method for classification, regression, and other tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time. The core principle of Random Forest is to leverage the wisdom of the crowd by combining the predictions of several decision trees to improve the overall model accuracy and control over-fitting.\n\n### Function Parameters:\n\n- **data**: This parameter represents the dataset on which the Random Forest Model will be trained. It should be a structured dataset, typically in the form of a DataFrame, where rows correspond to data points and columns correspond to features. The data should also include a target variable, which is the variable the model aims to predict.\n\n### Functionality:\n\nUpon invocation, the function will initialize a Random Forest Model with default or pre-specified hyperparameters such as the number of trees in the forest, the maximum depth of the trees, and the number of features to consider when looking for the best split. The function will then proceed to fit the model to the training data, utilizing a specified target variable from the dataset.\n\n### Edge Cases and Considerations:\n\n- The dataset provided must not contain any missing values in the features or the target variable as this could lead to errors during model training.\n- Categorical features, if any, should be appropriately encoded to numerical values before training the model.\n- The function's performance and accuracy can be significantly influenced by the choice of hyperparameters and the quality of the input data.\n\n### Usage Example:\n\n```python\n# Assuming `train_data` is a DataFrame with features and a target column named 'target'\nmodel = train_random_forest(data=train_data)\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how to call the function with a prepared dataset ready for training.

The function requires two parameters as input: the mean and the standard deviation. \n\nThe mean parameter represents the central tendency of the distribution, where the peak of the curve occurs. It is the point about which the data points are distributed symmetrically, and it determines the location of the center of the distribution on the number line.\n\nThe standard deviation parameter measures the amount of variation or dispersion from the mean.

If there are no favorable outcomes, the probability will be zero, indicating that the event cannot occur. Additionally, if the number of favorable outcomes equals the total number of possible outcomes, the probability will be one, signifying that the event is certain to happen.\n\nThe function can be used in various scenarios, such as determining the likelihood of drawing a specific card from a deck, predicting weather events, or assessing risks in decision-making processes. It is essential for users to clearly define what constitutes a favorable outcome and to correctly identify the total set of possible outcomes to ensure accurate probability calculations.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"total_outcomes": {"type": "integer", "description": "Total number of possible outcomes."}, "favorable_outcomes": {"type": "integer", "description": "Number of outcomes considered as 'successful'."}, "round_to": {"type": "integer", "description": "Number of decimal places to round the result to.", "default": 2}}, "required": ["total_outcomes", "favorable_outcomes"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\nTo calculate the probability of drawing a king from a deck of cards, we can use the `calculate_probability` function.

This calculation involves determining how likely it is for a specific event to occur within a defined set of possible outcomes. It is expressed as a value between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates that the event cannot occur under any circumstances, and 1 indicates that the event is certain to occur.\n\nIn the context of this function, the probability is typically calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. For example, if you're rolling a fair six-sided die and want to calculate the probability of rolling a four, there is one favorable outcome (rolling a four) and six possible outcomes (one for each side of the die), so the probability would be 1/6.\n\nTo utilize this function, you would generally provide two parameters: the number of favorable outcomes and the total number of possible outcomes, both of which should be non-negative integers. The function then returns a floating-point number representing the probability, ensuring that the division is handled appropriately to maintain precision.\n\nThis function is particularly useful in a wide range of applications, from simple games of chance to complex statistical models. Users should be cautious when defining the inputs to ensure that the total number of possible outcomes is not zero, as this would result in a division by zero error, which is undefined in mathematics and would lead to a runtime error in most programming environments.\n\nHere's an example of how the function might be used:\n\n```python\n# Example usage:\nnumber_of_favorable_outcomes = 1\ntotal_number_of_possible_outcomes = 6\nprobability = calculate_probability(number_of_favorable_outcomes, total_number_of_possible_outcomes)\nprint(\"The probability of the event is:\", probability)\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `calculate_probability` is called with the parameters for a single favorable outcome and a total of six possible outcomes, which outputs the probability of approximately 0", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"success_outcomes": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of successful outcomes."}, "total_outcomes": {"type": "integer", "description": "The total number of possible outcomes."}, "format_as_ratio": {"type": "boolean", "description": "When true, formats the output as a ratio instead of a decimal.

For strings, it returns the characters in reverse order. For booleans, it returns the negation. For numbers, it returns the negative value.The function takes an input and performs a reversal operation appropriate to the input's type, returning the opposite or inverted form of that input. When the input is a string, the function processes it by reversing the sequence of characters, effectively returning a new string where the last character of the original string becomes the first character of the reversed string, the second to last becomes the second, and so on, until the first character appears at the end of the new string. This operation is akin to reading the original string backward, from end to start.\n\nIn the case of a boolean input, the function returns the logical negation of the given boolean value. This means it will convert `true` to `false` and `false` to `true`. This type of operation is equivalent to applying a logical NOT operation, effectively flipping the truthiness of the input boolean.\n\nFor numeric inputs, the function returns the numeric negation of the input value. This involves changing the sign of the number: a positive number becomes its corresponding negative value, and a negative number becomes its corresponding positive value. For example, if the input is `5`, the output will be `-5`, and if the input is `-3`, the output will be `3`. In the case of zero, since it is neither positive nor negative, the negation of zero will still result in zero, maintaining its neutral numeric status.\n\nUsage examples:\n\n- For a string input `hello`, the function will return `olleh`.\n- For a boolean input `true`, the function will return `false`.\n- For a numeric input `42`, the function will return `-42`.\n\nThis function is versatile, handling multiple data types by applying the appropriate reversal logic to each type of input it encounters.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["input_value"], "properties": {"input_value": {"type": "any", "description": "The value to be reversed.

This metric indicates how effectively the company is using the capital invested by its shareholders to generate profits.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **Net Income**: This is the total profit of the company after all expenses and taxes have been deducted from total revenue. It represents the company's earnings over a specific period, typically a fiscal quarter or year. Net income is a critical input for calculating ROE as it reflects the profitability generated from shareholders' investments.\n\n2. **Shareholder's Equity**: This represents the total equity ownership in the company, which is the residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting liabilities. It includes the amount initially invested by shareholders plus any retained earnings. Shareholder's equity is crucial for the ROE calculation as it forms the denominator in determining how much profit is generated per unit of equity.\n\n3. **Dividends Paid**: These are the distributions made by the company to its shareholders, derived from its net income. While dividends represent a return to shareholders, they are subtracted from net income in certain calculations to reflect the earnings retained in the business. However, in the context of standard ROE calculations, dividends are generally not deducted from net income as ROE typically measures the return on the total equity base rather than retained earnings.\n\n#### Calculation:\n\nThe formula used for calculating Return on Equity is:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Shareholder's Equity}} \\]\n\nThis formula provides a percentage that signifies the return generated on every dollar of equity. For example, an ROE of 15% indicates that for every dollar of equity, the company generates $0.15 in profit.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose a company has a net income of $200,000, shareholder's", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"net_income": {"type": "integer", "description": "The company's net income."}, "shareholder_equity": {"type": "integer", "description": "The company's total shareholder's equity."}, "dividends_paid": {"type": "integer", "description": "The total dividends paid by the company.

It is typically based on past performance or projected future returns and is expressed as a percentage. For instance, a yearly yield of 5% suggests that the investment is expected to grow by 5% each year.\n\n- **Investment Amount**: This is the total initial capital invested in the mutual fund. The function uses this parameter to compute how much the investment will potentially grow over the specified period. For example, an investment of $10,000 acts as the principal amount that will compound according to the yearly yield.\n\n- **Time Period**: This parameter indicates the duration, usually in years, for which the investment will be held in the mutual fund. It determines the number of times the yearly yield will be applied to the investment amount. For example, a time period of 10 years means the investment will compound annually for ten years.\n\nThe function assumes that the yield remains constant throughout the specified period and that no additional investments or withdrawals are made during this time.

The `os.system()` function provides a means to run shell commands directly from a Python script, allowing interaction with the system shell in a straightforward manner.\n\nFor usage on Windows, this function can execute a single command or multiple commands sequenced together using the logical AND operator '&&'. This chaining with '&&' is significant because it allows for the execution of multiple commands in a single call.

In this example, the command first attempts to change to `some_directory`. If successful, it proceeds to list the directory contents using the `dir` command.\n\nRemember that the `os.system()` call is synchronous, meaning the Python script will wait for the command to complete execution before continuing. Additionally, the return value of `os.system()` is typically the exit status of the shell command, with a return value of `0` generally indicating success and any non-zero value indicating an error.\n\nUsers should be cautious while using this function as executing system-level commands can pose security risks, especially if untrusted input is used to construct the commands.

This calculation is essential for investors and financial planners to estimate how much an investment will be worth in the future, considering the effects of compounding interest or returns over time.\n\n### Parameters:\n1. **Initial Investment**: This parameter represents the starting amount of money invested. It serves as the principal amount upon which interest or returns will be calculated.

This rate assumes a constant return throughout the investment period.\n\n3. **Time Frame**: This parameter specifies the investment duration in years. It denotes the total number of years the investment is expected to grow at the specified annual rate of return. The time frame must be a positive integer, as negative time frames or zero would not make sense in this context.\n\n### Calculation Process:\nThe function typically uses the formula for compound interest to determine the future value of the investment.

The use of '&&' enables the execution of subsequent commands only if the preceding command completes successfully without errors. This feature is particularly useful for scripting scenarios where conditional command execution is required. For example, a user might wish to compile a program and then run it immediately afterward, provided that the compilation step is successful. Here, the function would be invoked with a string formatted like `\"compile_program && run_executable\"`, allowing for streamlined task automation. It's important to note that the function will return the exit status of the command execution, where a zero typically indicates success, and any non-zero value indicates an error. Consequently, understanding the expected exit status and interpreting it correctly is crucial for error handling in scripts using this function. Additionally, users should be aware of the security implications of executing system-level commands and ensure that command inputs are validated to avoid any potential security vulnerabilities.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

This method provides a way to run commands directly from the command line interface, allowing for the automation and execution of various tasks that would typically be performed manually by a user within the Windows Command Prompt.\n\nThe function is capable of executing a single command, which could range from simple tasks like creating a directory (`mkdir`) or listing files in a directory (`dir`), to more complex operations like launching applications or running scripts. In addition to executing a single command, the function also supports the execution of multiple commands that can be chained together using the '&&' operator. This chaining allows for sequential execution, meaning the subsequent command will only run if the preceding command has completed successfully. For instance, a command string such as `\"mkdir new_folder && cd new_folder && echo 'Hello World' > hello.txt\"` will create a new directory, navigate into it, and then create a text file with a message, executing each step contingent upon the success of the previous one.\n\nIt is important to consider that, when using this function, the commands are executed in the context of the Windows shell, potentially affecting the current directory or environment variables if not carefully managed.

This functionality allows for the execution of command-line operations directly from within a Python script, thereby enabling automation of tasks that would typically require manual execution through a command prompt.\n\nWhen using this function, you have the flexibility to execute either a single command or a series of commands chained together. Chaining is achieved by using the '&&' operator, which allows you to execute multiple commands sequentially.

Once the `.bat` file is created, you can then run it using the same `os.system()` function to achieve the desired complex task execution.\n\nHere is an example of how this function might be used:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Single command execution\nos.system('echo Hello, World!')\n\n# Multiple commands using '&&'\nos.system('cd C:\\\\SomeDirectory && dir')\n\n# For complex tasks\n# Create a .bat file named task.bat with the following content:\n# @echo off\n# echo This is a complex task\n# dir\n# Then execute it like this:\nos.system('task.bat')\n```\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can effectively use the `os.system()` function on Windows to execute both simple and complex command sequences.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The Windows command line instruction(s) to be executed.

For multiple commands, separate them with '&&'. For complex tasks, create and run a .bat file.This function is designed to execute a specified command on Windows operating systems by utilizing the `os.system()` function from Python's `os` module. The `os.system()` function enables the execution of a command as if it were being run directly from the command line or terminal on a Windows machine. This function is particularly useful for automating tasks that would normally be executed manually.\n\nTo run multiple commands sequentially within a single execution, you can concatenate the desired commands using the '&&' operator, which ensures that each command is executed only if the preceding command completes successfully without any errors. This is a simple and effective way to string together a series of tasks.\n\nHowever, for more intricate or elaborate tasks that require extensive scripting, it is advisable to create a batch (.bat) file. A .bat file allows for a more structured approach to task execution. It can incorporate conditional logic, loops, and other advanced scripting capabilities that extend beyond the straightforward command execution provided by `os.system()`. Once your batch file is ready, you can execute it through the same `os.system()` function by passing the path to the .bat file as a parameter. This approach helps in keeping your code clean and manageable.\n\nHere is a basic usage example for executing a single command:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.system('echo Hello, World!')\n```\n\nAnd an example for multiple commands:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.system('cd C:\\\\ && dir')\n```\n\nIn this example, the first command changes the directory to the root of the C:\\ drive, and the second command lists the contents of the current directory. This is a simple demonstration of how `&&` can be used to chain commands together.\n\nWhen creating a .bat file, you might have something like this:\n\n```bat\n@echo off\necho This is a batch file\npause\n```\n\nYou would save this as `example.bat` and execute it as follows:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.system('example", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The Windows command line instruction(s) to be executed.

The criteria include the type of service offered, the geographical location in which the service providers operate, and their availability for providing services. \n\n### Parameters:\n\n1. **Service Type**: This parameter specifies the category or nature of services sought by the user. It allows the function to filter the service providers to include only those who offer the type of service matching the user's requirement, such as plumbing, electrical work, or housekeeping.\n\n2. **Location**: This parameter defines the geographical area or region where the user needs the service to be provided. By specifying a location, the function can narrow down the list of service providers to those who are within the desired vicinity, ensuring that the providers are accessible and relevant to the user's specific area.\n\n3. **Availability**: This criterion considers the timeframes during which the user needs the service to be available. It helps in filtering out service providers who do not have availability matching the specified schedule or time period, thereby optimizing the match between users and providers based on real-time availability data.\n\n### Usage Example:\n\nA user looking for a plumber in the downtown area of a city who is available on weekdays during the afternoon can use this function by inputting \"plumbing\" as the service type, specifying \"downtown\" as the location, and choosing \"weekdays afternoon\" for availability. The function will then return a curated list of plumbers who meet all these specified criteria, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of finding the right service provider for the user's needs.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n\n- If no service providers meet all the specified criteria, the function might return an empty list, indicating that no matches were found.\n- The function should handle cases where the input criteria are too broad or too narrow, potentially offering suggestions for refining the search parameters to achieve more accurate results.\n- It is important that the function effectively manages scenarios where multiple providers", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["service_id"], "properties": {"service_id": {"type": "integer", "description": "The unique identifier of the service.

The criteria include three primary parameters: the director, the genre, and the cast. Each parameter allows the user to narrow down the search results to find movies that best meet their interests or research requirements.\n\n- **Director**: The user can specify a particular director's name to filter the movies directed by that individual. This helps in finding all movies associated with specific directors and is especially useful for users interested in exploring the filmography of directors whose work they admire or wish to study.\n\n- **Genre**: By specifying a genre, users can filter movies that belong to a particular category, such as \"comedy,\" \"drama,\" \"thriller,\" etc. This parameter is beneficial for users looking to explore movies within a specific genre that aligns with their mood or preference at the time.\n\n- **Cast**: Users can specify one or more actors to filter movies that include the specified cast members. This is particularly useful for fans of certain actors who wish to see films featuring their favorite performers or for those examining the range of roles played by particular actors throughout their careers.\n\nThe function then processes these criteria to generate a list of movies that match all specified parameters. It ensures that the retrieved movies align with the user's input, thereby enhancing the movie discovery process. For instance, if a user inputs \"Steven Spielberg\" as the director, \"adventure\" as the genre, and \"Harrison Ford\" as a cast member, the function will return a list of movies directed by Steven Spielberg, categorized as adventure, and featuring Harrison Ford.\n\nThis function is an ideal tool for movie enthusiasts, researchers, or casual viewers looking to tailor their movie-watching experience according to specific interests.

The selection process is based on three main parameters: the director, the genre, and the cast. Here\u2019s a more detailed breakdown of these parameters:\n\n- **Director**: The user can specify the name of a director to filter movies that have been directed by this individual. This allows users to find all films associated with a particular director\u2019s style or thematic preference.\n\n- **Genre**: The function accepts a genre parameter, enabling the user to filter movies by specific genres like comedy, drama, action, thriller, etc. This helps in narrowing down the movie list to those fitting a certain mood or thematic category.\n\n- **Cast**: Users can specify one or more cast members as criteria. The function will then retrieve movies that include these actors or actresses, allowing users to explore films that feature their favorite performers.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- **Multiple Criteria**: When multiple criteria are specified, the function applies an AND logic, meaning that only movies satisfying all specified conditions (director, genre, and cast) are included in the results.\n\n- **No Criteria**: If no criteria are specified by the user, the function may return an empty list or a default list of popular or trending movies, depending on the system's configuration.\n\n- **Invalid or Non-existent Criteria**: If the user provides criteria that do not match any movies in the database (e.g., a non-existent director or genre), the function will likely return an empty list, indicating that no movies meet those specifications.\n\n### Usage Example\n\nSuppose a user is interested in finding movies directed by Christopher Nolan, in the genre of science fiction, featuring actor Leonardo DiCaprio.

Additionally, by selecting certain cast members, the function ensures that only movies featuring these actors or actresses are included in the results. \n\nThis multi-criteria filtering enables users to find movies that align closely with their interests, be it based on the creative vision of a certain director, the thematic elements associated with a particular genre, or the performances of specific cast members. \n\nEdge cases to consider might involve scenarios where very few or no movies meet all the specified criteria due to the uniqueness or rarity of the combination. In such cases, the function might return an empty list or a limited set of results. \n\nAn example usage of this function could involve a user looking for science fiction movies directed by Christopher Nolan and featuring the actor Leonardo DiCaprio.

It operates by receiving a unique identifier or a distinct reference to the particular neuron whose location data is sought. Upon execution, the function will return the coordinates, typically in a three-dimensional format, representing the neuron's precise position within the rat's brain structure.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **neuron_id**: A required parameter that serves as the unique identifier for the neuron. This could be in the form of a string or a numerical value, depending on how neurons are catalogued in the data source. The identifier ensures that the function retrieves the correct neuron, especially in datasets containing numerous neurons.\n\n#### Return Value:\n\n- The function outputs the coordinates of the specified neuron. These coordinates are usually provided as a tuple or list containing three numerical values, corresponding to the x, y, and z axes in the brain's anatomical space. This three-dimensional data is crucial for determining the neuron's exact location within the complex structure of the rat's brain.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Invalid Neuron ID**: If a neuron_id is provided that does not correspond to any known neuron in the dataset, the function should handle this gracefully, either by returning a null value or raising an appropriate exception that highlights the issue.\n  \n- **Coordinate Precision**: The precision of the returned coordinates might vary depending on the resolution of the data available. Users must be aware that higher precision may be crucial for detailed analyses or applications.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nTo utilize this function effectively, a user would first ensure that they have the correct identifier for the desired neuron. For instance:\n\n```python\n# Assume neuron_id '1234' corresponds to a particular neuron\ncoordinates = retrieve_neuron_coordinates('1234')\nprint(coordinates)\n```\n\nIn this example, the function call retrieves the spatial coordinates of the neuron identified by '1234'.

Higher input or weight increases firing rate and higher decay rate decreases it.The function calculates the neuronal activity, specifically the rate at which a neuron fires, by taking into account several critical factors: the input synaptic rate, the weight of the inputs, and the decay rate. Each of these parameters plays a vital role in determining the overall firing rate of the neuron.\n\n1. **Input Synaptic Rate**: This is the frequency or rate at which synaptic inputs are received by the neuron. It represents how often the neuron is stimulated by incoming signals from other neurons. A higher input synaptic rate indicates that the neuron is receiving a large number of signals in a given time period, which typically leads to an increase in the neuron's firing rate.\n\n2. **Weight of Inputs**: This parameter measures the strength or influence of the synaptic inputs on the neuron. Each synapse connecting to a neuron can have a different weight, representing its significance. Larger weights signify stronger synaptic connections, thereby increasing the likelihood of the neuron firing. When the weight of inputs is high, even a moderate input synaptic rate can lead to a substantial increase in the firing rate.\n\n3. **Decay Rate**: This represents the rate at which the neuron's firing rate decreases over time in the absence of incoming signals. Essentially, it characterizes how quickly the neuron's activity diminishes when not actively stimulated. A higher decay rate means the neuron's firing rate will decrease more rapidly, effectively counteracting the effects of high input synaptic rates or weights. Thus, an increase in decay rate results in a decrease in the firing rate.\n\nBy considering these parameters, the function computes the neuron's firing rate, balancing the excitation from input synaptic rates and weights against the inhibition from the decay rate. For instance, if a neuron receives a high synaptic input rate and the weights of these inputs are significant, it will fire more frequently unless the decay rate is also notably high, which would reduce the firing rate.

Optionally, a return time can be specified for round-trip bookings.The `bookFlight` function is designed to facilitate the booking of airline tickets by utilizing essential travel details provided by the user. The core functionality of this function requires the user to specify a departure location, which indicates the airport or city from which the flight will commence. Along with the departure location, the user must provide a specific departure time, ensuring that the booking aligns with the desired travel schedule.\n\nIn addition to these mandatory parameters, the function offers an optional feature for users interested in arranging round-trip travel plans. For such cases, a return time can be included in the booking request. This optional parameter allows the function to schedule a return flight, thus completing the round-trip itinerary. If the return time is not provided, the function will proceed with booking a one-way flight based on the departure details alone.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\n```python\n# Booking a one-way flight\nbookFlight(departure_location=\"New York JFK\", departure_time=\"2023-12-15 08:00\")\n\n# Booking a round-trip flight\nbookFlight(departure_location=\"New York JFK\", departure_time=\"2023-12-15 08:00\", return_time=\"2023-12-22 12:00\")\n```\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `departure_location` (str): A string specifying the name or code of the airport or city from which the flight will depart.\n- `departure_time` (str): A string representing the date and time when the flight is scheduled to leave the departure location. It should follow a standard date-time format.\n- `return_time` (str, optional): A string indicating the date and time for the return flight in cases where a round-trip is desired. This parameter is optional and should also follow a standard date-time format.

This is achieved by leveraging three critical pieces of information: the flight's unique identifier, the passenger's name, and their ticket number. Each of these elements plays a vital role in ensuring the correct flight information is retrieved for the right individual.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **Flight Unique Identifier**: This is a unique code or number assigned to each flight, serving as a primary means of identifying and differentiating it from other flights. It is typically comprised of the airline's two-character IATA code and a numeric sequence. Example: \"AA100\" might represent an American Airlines flight number.\n\n2. **Passenger's Name**: The full name of the passenger as it appears on the ticket. This parameter is crucial for validating the request and ensuring that the status information is provided for the correct individual. The name should match exactly what is documented in the booking details, including any middle names or initials if applicable.\n\n3. **Ticket Number**: A unique number assigned to the passenger's ticket, used to confirm their booking on the flight. This identifier is essential for verifying the passenger's reservation and retrieving the associated flight status. It typically consists of a string of digits and may include a prefix related to the airline.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\nUpon execution, the function cross-references these inputs against the airline's database or another relevant data source. This ensures the flight status returned is accurate and specific to the flight and passenger in question. The status may include information such as scheduled departure and arrival times, delays, cancellations, gate assignments, or boarding updates.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nFor instance, if a passenger named \"John Doe\" with a ticket number \"1234567890\" wishes to know the current status of their flight \"AA100\", the function would be called with these parameters. It would then return the most up-to-date status of flight \"AA100\" as", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["flight_id", "passenger_name", "ticket_number"], "properties": {"flight_id": {"type": "string", "description": "The unique identifier of the flight, typically in the format 'XX123' where 'XX' represents the airline code followed by the flight number."}, "passenger_name": {"type": "string", "description": "Full name or first name of the passenger as it appears on the ticket."}, "ticket_number": {"type": "string", "description": "Unique ticket number provided to the passenger upon booking, usually consisting of a series of numbers and/or letters."}}}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\nTo get the current status of Karan's Indigo flight, we need to provide the passenger's name.

This is crucial for ensuring that the paint is applied evenly and effectively across the entire surface without running short or having excess. \n\nTo achieve this, the function takes two primary inputs:\n\n1. **Surface Area (required input):** This parameter represents the total area that needs to be covered with paint. It is typically measured in square units, such as square feet or square meters, depending on the region or preference. The surface area can be calculated based on the dimensions of the area to be painted, such as walls, ceilings, or any surface needing a coat of paint.\n\n2. **Coverage Rate (required input):** This input specifies how much area a single unit (often a gallon or liter) of the paint can cover. The coverage rate is usually provided by the manufacturer and can vary based on paint quality, type, and color. It is usually expressed in square units per unit of paint, indicating the efficiency of the paint in covering surfaces.\n\nThe function uses these inputs to compute the total amount of paint necessary by dividing the surface area by the coverage rate.

It takes into account two main parameters: the music scale and the desired duration of the mix. By manipulating these parameters, users can create a unique version of a song that adheres to a particular musical scale and fits within a specified time frame.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **Music Scale**: \n   - The music scale parameter determines the tonal framework of the mix. This could include major, minor, pentatonic, or other scales, each providing a distinct mood and character to the mix. The choice of scale influences the notes and chords used in the song, resulting in a mix that aligns with the desired musical qualities.\n   - Users should ensure that the chosen scale is compatible with the original song's key to maintain musical coherence and harmony.\n\n2. **Duration**:\n   - The duration parameter specifies the target length of the song mix. It is defined in standard time units, such as seconds or minutes. The function will adjust the song's structure, possibly by altering the tempo, repeating sections, or trimming parts, to fit within the specified duration.\n   - Care should be taken to choose a duration that allows for a coherent musical flow, avoiding abrupt transitions or excessively long repetitive sections.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose a user wants to create a mix of a popular song in a minor scale lasting exactly three minutes. They would provide 'minor' as the music scale parameter and '3:00' as the duration. The function would then process the song, ensuring that the mix stays true to the emotional depth of a minor scale while precisely meeting the three-minute requirement.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Mismatch in Scale and Key**: If the chosen scale doesn't match well with the original song's key, the resulting mix may sound dissonant or jarring.

This key provides the tonal center around which the chords will be organized, ensuring that the progression maintains a consistent harmonic context. For example, if the key of C major is chosen, the chords generated will be based on the notes of the C major scale, such as C major, D minor, E minor, and so on.\n\nThe second parameter determines the number of chords in the progression. This allows for flexibility in creating progressions of varying lengths, tailored to the musical form or section you are composing. Whether you need a simple four-chord progression for a verse or a more complex eight-chord sequence for a bridge, this parameter can be adjusted to meet your musical needs.\n\nThe function might include considerations for common chord progressions, such as the I-IV-V-I pattern, which is prevalent in many genres of music, from classical to pop.

In Monopoly and similar games, understanding the likelihood of rolling particular sums can influence strategic decisions, making this function especially useful for players seeking to optimize their gameplay.\n\nThe standard six-sided dice are numbered from 1 to 6.

Initially, the function begins with a deck consisting of 52 cards, each representing one of the unique cards found in a standard deck. These cards include four suits\u2014hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades\u2014each containing 13 ranks, ranging from Ace to King.\n\nThe first operation executed by the function is shuffling. Shuffling involves randomizing the order of the cards in the deck to ensure that they are mixed thoroughly. This randomization process is essential to remove any predictability from the deck's order, simulating the act of shuffling cards in a real-world scenario. The shuffling should ideally be unbiased, meaning that each possible permutation of the card order is equally likely.\n\nOnce the deck is shuffled, the function proceeds to the second operation: drawing a specified number of cards from the top of the shuffled deck. The number of cards to be drawn is provided as an input parameter to the function, allowing the user to specify how many cards they wish to draw from the deck. It is essential to clarify that the number of cards to be drawn must be a positive integer and should not exceed the total number of cards in the deck\u201452\u2014although typically, you might draw fewer than the total number.\n\nFor example, if the user specifies that they would like to draw five cards, the function will remove the top five cards from the shuffled deck and return them as the drawn cards. These drawn cards are typically presented in the order they were drawn, maintaining the sequence from the top of the deck to the fifth card.\n\nMoreover, it is important to handle edge cases where the input parameter might be invalid. These include cases where the specified number of cards to draw is zero, negative, or greater than 52. The function should be equipped to handle such cases gracefully, possibly by returning an error message or adjusting the number of cards drawn to a valid number", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"num_cards": {"type": "integer", "description": "Number of cards to be drawn.

A standard deck consists of 52 cards, which are divided into four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit contains 13 cards, ranging from Ace to King. The total number of unique cards in the deck ensures various combinations and probabilities based on the desired card or suit.\n\nThe probability of drawing a specific card, such as the Queen of Hearts, is determined by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes in the deck. Since there is only one Queen of Hearts in the entire deck, the probability is calculated as 1/52.\n\nSimilarly, if the objective is to calculate the probability of drawing a card from a particular suit, such as hearts, the function considers the 13 possible favorable outcomes (all the hearts in the deck) against the total 52 cards. Therefore, the probability of drawing a card from the hearts suit is 13/52, which simplifies to 1/4.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- If any cards have been removed from the deck, the total number of cards and the specific number of cards in each suit must be adjusted accordingly when calculating probabilities.\n- The function assumes a fair deck, meaning each card has an equal chance of being drawn.\n\n### Usage Example:\nSuppose you're interested in finding out the probability of drawing an Ace from a full deck. The function would take the input specifying the card rank \"Ace\" and without specifying a suit, calculate that there are 4 Aces in the deck. Thus, the probability of drawing an Ace would be 4/52, which reduces to 1/13.

Unlike simple distance calculations, such as the Euclidean distance which assumes a flat, featureless plane, this function incorporates variations in the terrain that can affect the actual travel distance.\n\nThe function takes as input parameters the coordinates of the two locations, typically provided as latitude and longitude pairs. Additionally, it requires data or information regarding the terrain, which may include elevation changes, obstacles, and other geographical features that might influence the path between the two points. The terrain data can be supplied as a digital elevation model (DEM), a terrain map, or other relevant geographical information systems (GIS) data.\n\nBy utilizing this terrain information, the function can more accurately reflect real-world distances, providing a result that is representative of the actual path one might take when traversing the terrain. This can be especially useful in applications such as hiking, off-road navigation, or planning routes in areas with significant geographical features.\n\nMoreover, the function can also consider specific factors such as the slope of the terrain, the presence of water bodies, and vegetation covers, among others.
