The core functionality ensures that the name of the food item, as provided by the customer, is transformed into uppercase letters. This conversion to uppercase is a mandatory requirement, possibly for maintaining consistency, adhering to a database schema, or meeting a specific formatting standard within the application.\n\nWhen the function is called, it receives a food name as input, which is then processed internally to ensure it is in uppercase. This transformation could involve converting all alphabetic characters in the input string to their corresponding uppercase versions, effectively ignoring any initial casing or user input errors related to capitalization. It's crucial for developers or users of this function to provide a valid food name as input, as the function assumes that the input is a legitimate food item intended to be part of the selection process.\n\nThe function could be utilized in various scenarios, such as updating a menu, processing customer orders, or interacting with a backend system that requires uppercase food names for data integrity or processing purposes. To illustrate, if a customer requests a change from \"salad\" to \"pasta,\" the function will convert \"pasta\" to \"PASTA\" before processing the request further.\n\nIn terms of edge cases, it's important to consider situations where the input may already be in uppercase. In such cases, the function will still perform the conversion process, although it will not alter the input. Moreover, non-alphabetic characters in the input string, such as numbers or symbols, will remain unchanged, as they do not have uppercase or lowercase forms.\n\nIn summary, this function provides a robust mechanism to change food selections while ensuring that all food names conform to an uppercase format, maintaining consistency and meeting specified requirements.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["TheFod"], "properties": {"TheFod": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the food to be changed, provided in uppercase letters only (e.g., 'PIZZA', 'BURGER').", "enum": ["PIZZA", "BURGER", "SALAD", "SOUP", "STEAK"]}}}}, {"name": "ChaFod2", "description": "Changes the selection of food based on the customer's request, ensuring the food name provided is in uppercase as per the requirement.Example: ChaFod({'TheFod': 'PIZZA'}) changes the selection to PIZZA. \n\nExample: ChaFod({'TheFod': 'SALAD'}) changes the selection to SALAD. \n\nExample: ChaFod({'TheFod': 'STEAK'}) changes the selection to STEAK.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["TheFod"], "properties": {"TheFod": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the food to be changed, provided in uppercase letters only (e.g., 'PIZZA', 'BURGER').", "enum": ["PIZZA", "BURGER", "SALAD", "SOUP", "STEAK"]}}}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"ChaFod2": {"TheFod": "WHOPPER"}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"ChaFod2": {"TheFod": "WHOPPER"}}], "possible_answer": [{"ChaFod1": {"TheFod": ["BURGER"]}}, {"ChaFod2": {"TheFod": ["BURGER"]}}, {"ChaFod3": {"TheFod": ["BURGER"]}}]}

It accepts a single integer as an input parameter, typically a positive integer greater than 1. The function will perform checks to ensure that the input is valid and handle any potential errors or exceptions that may arise from invalid inputs, such as non-integer or negative values.\n\nPrime factorization involves determining the smallest prime number that can divide the input integer, then dividing the integer by this prime number, and repeating the process with the quotient obtained. This process continues iteratively until the quotient becomes 1. Each prime number identified during this process is recorded as part of the factorization. \n\nIn edge cases where the input is a prime number itself, the function will return a list containing just the input number, indicating that the integer is only divisible by 1 and itself. The algorithm typically starts by testing divisibility with the smallest prime number, 2, and then proceeds with subsequent odd numbers.\n\nHere is an example of how the function might be used: if the input integer is 28, the prime factorization would be [2, 2, 7], as 28 can be expressed as 2 x 2 x 7. For the input 15, the return would be [3, 5], since 15 is the product of the prime numbers 3 and 5.\n\nIt's important to note that the function assumes the input number is within a reasonable range for computation, and extremely large integers could result in longer processing times.

It is important because the energy involved in the phase change is directly proportional to the mass.

This predictive capability leverages a model trained on a dataset that correlates these physical attributes with the incidence of diabetes type 2, thus providing a probabilistic assessment.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `weight`: This parameter represents the individual\u2019s weight, typically measured in kilograms or pounds. It is crucial to ensure that the weight input is accurately measured and converted to the appropriate unit to maintain the integrity of the prediction.\n- `height`: The height of the individual is another critical input, usually recorded in meters or inches. Similar to weight, the height should be precisely measured and standardized to the unit expected by the function for consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Functionality:**\n- The function processes these inputs through a computational model, which likely involves statistical or machine learning algorithms trained to recognize patterns between body mass index (BMI), calculated from height and weight, and the predisposition to Type 2 diabetes.\n- The output is a probability score that indicates the likelihood of the individual developing diabetes type 2. This score is typically a value between 0 and 1, where a higher value suggests an increased risk.\n\n**Edge Cases and Considerations:**\n- Ensure that the input values for weight and height are within a reasonable range to avoid skewed predictions. Extremely low or high values may not be within the valid range that the model was trained on and could lead to inaccurate predictions.\n- Consider the unit consistency for weight and height. If the function expects metric units, then inputs should be converted accordingly if they are initially provided in imperial units.\n- The function does not account for other risk factors such as age, family history, or lifestyle, which are also significant contributors to the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.

To calculate this, the function requires two key pieces of data: the total population of the country in the specified year and the land area of the country.\n\nParameters:\n\n1. `country_name` (string): The name of the country for which you want to calculate the population density. This should be the official name as recognized in international databases to ensure accuracy.\n\n2. `year` (integer): The specific year you are interested in. This parameter helps fetch the population data corresponding to that year. It should be in the format of a four-digit year, for example, 2020.\n\nUsage:\n\nTo use this function, ensure you have reliable datasets that can provide the total population and land area for the country in the specified year. It's important to have accurate data since the function depends on these inputs to deliver a precise result.\n\nFor example, if you want to calculate the population density of Japan in the year 2020, you would need to know Japan's total population and land area for that year. Once you have these, the function will divide the total population by the land area, resulting in the population density.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\n- If the population data is unavailable for the specified year, the function may return an error or a null value depending on the implementation.\n- Similarly, if the land area is zero or not defined, handling such cases appropriately is crucial to avoid division by zero errors.\n\nThe function is instrumental in demographic studies, urban planning, and environmental assessments, where understanding how densely populated a country is can inform a wide range of strategic decisions.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"country": {"type": "string", "description": "The country for which the density needs to be calculated."}, "year": {"type": "string", "description": "The year in which the density is to be calculated."}, "population": {"type": "integer", "description": "The population of the country."}, "land_area": {"type": "integer", "description": "The land area of the country in square kilometers."}}, "required": ["country", "year", "population", "land_area"]}}, {"name": "calculate_density2", "description": "Calculate the population density of a specific country in a specific year.Example: calculate_density(country=\"Canada\", year=\"2020\", population=37742154, land_area=9984670) returns 3.78.\n\nExample: calculate_density(country=\"India\", year=\"2021\", population=1393409038, land_area=3287263) returns 424.74.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"country": {"type": "string", "description": "The country for which the density needs to be calculated."}, "year": {"type": "string", "description": "The year in which the density is to be calculated."}, "population": {"type": "integer", "description": "The population of the country."}, "land_area": {"type": "integer", "description": "The land area of the country in square kilometers."}}, "required": ["country", "year", "population", "land_area"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"calculate_density1": {"country": "Brazil", "year": 2022, "population": 213000000, "land_area": 8500000}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"calculate_density1": {"country": "Brazil", "year": 2022, "population": 213000000, "land_area": 8500000}}], "possible_answer": [{"calculate_density1": {"country": ["Brazil"], "year": ["2022"], "population": [213000000], "land_area": [8500000]}}, {"calculate_density2": {"country": ["Brazil"], "year": ["2022"], "population": [213000000], "land_area": [8500000]}}, {"calculate_density3": {"country": ["Brazil"], "year": ["2022"], "population": [213000000], "land_area": [8500000]}}]}

BMI is a numerical value of a person's weight in relation to their height and is commonly used as a general health indicator. This function requires two primary input parameters: the weight of the person, typically in kilograms, and their height, usually in meters. It employs the standard formula for BMI calculation, which is the weight divided by the square of the height (BMI = weight / (height * height)).\n\nThe calculation of BMI provides an estimate of whether a person has a healthy body weight for a given height. A high BMI can be an indicator of high body fatness, while a low BMI might suggest underweight. The resulting BMI value is usually categorized into different classifications such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and various classes of obesity, although these classifications are not handled by the function itself.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to ensure that both input parameters are positive and non-zero, as negative or zero values for weight or height would lead to incorrect results or mathematical errors, such as division by zero. Additionally, if the height is given in centimeters or inches, it should be converted to meters to ensure accuracy in the calculation.\n\nExample usage of this function might involve passing a weight of 70 kilograms and a height of 1.75 meters. The function would then compute the BMI as 22.86. This calculated BMI can then be used to assess the general health status of the individual according to standard BMI categories.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_bmi(weight, height):\n    if weight <= 0 or height <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Weight and height must be positive values.\")\n    bmi = weight / (height * height)\n    return bmi\n\n# Example usage:\nweight_in_kg = 70\nheight_in_meters = 1.75\nbmi = calculate_bmi(weight_in_kg, height_in_meters)\nprint(f\"The calculated BMI is: {bmi:.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"weight": {"type": "integer", "description": "Weight of the person in kilograms."}, "height": {"type": "integer", "description": "Height of the person in centimeters."}, "unit": {"type": "string", "description": "Optional parameter to choose between 'imperial' and 'metric' systems.

When invoked, it takes an input list containing elements that can be compared with each other, such as numbers or strings. The function's operation is contingent upon a specified parameter or flag which determines the order of sorting. \n\nWhen the ascending order is chosen, the function rearranges the list so that each element is less than or equal to the element that follows it. This means numbers will start from the smallest and increment to the largest, or strings will proceed alphabetically from A to Z. Conversely, when the descending order is selected, the list is reordered such that each element is greater than or equal to the one that follows, resulting in numbers being sorted from largest to smallest, or strings from Z to A.\n\nThe function handles a variety of lists, even those that are initially unsorted, and returns a new list in the desired order without altering the original list unless specified otherwise. In edge cases where the list is empty or contains elements that are already in the desired order, the function will handle these gracefully, simply returning the list as is.\n\nUsage example:\n- To sort a list of integers `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]` in ascending order, the function call would return `[1, 1, 3, 4, 5]`.\n- For descending order, the same list would be reordered to `[5, 4, 3, 1, 1]`.\n\nParameters:\n- `list`: The list of elements to be sorted. It must be composed of comparable types.\n- `order`: A flag that indicates the desired sorting order.

This means that the speed is determined by dividing the total distance covered by the total time taken to cover that distance.\n\nParameters:\n- **distance**: This parameter represents the total length of the path travelled by the object. It should be provided in units that are consistent with the time parameter to ensure that the speed calculation is accurate.

It effectively processes the input data, examining keywords, context, or patterns to determine the most suitable category for each query. This classification process is essential for organizing and managing large volumes of queries efficiently, allowing for quick access to relevant information or resources associated with each category.\n\nIn terms of usage, this function can be particularly beneficial in applications such as customer support systems, content management, or search engines, where understanding the intent behind queries and grouping them accordingly can enhance the overall user experience. The predefined categories are typically established based on the specific requirements or objectives of the system or application in which the function is employed.\n\nWhen implementing this function, it's important to consider the scope and definition of each category to ensure accurate classification. The robustness of the classification process may depend on the quality of the algorithms used for content analysis, as well as the comprehensiveness of the predefined categories.\n\nFor example, if the function is used within a customer support system, predefined categories might include \"Billing Inquiries,\" \"Technical Support,\" \"Account Management,\" and \"General Questions.\" The function would analyze incoming queries and assign them to one of these categories based on their content, enabling more efficient handling and resolution of customer issues.\n\nEdge cases to consider include queries that may not clearly fit into a single category or those that contain ambiguous language. In such scenarios, additional logic may be required to handle exceptions or direct queries to a default category for further human review.\n\nOverall, the function provides a streamlined method for query classification, facilitating better organization and management of information by ensuring that queries are systematically and accurately categorized based on their content.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["clean_hello", "faq_link_accounts_start"], "properties": {"clean_hello": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "An array of strings containing queries that are casual greetings or informal hellos."}, "faq_link_accounts_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "An array of strings with queries related to linking accounts within the bank's system."}}}}, {"name": "classify2", "description": "Classifies input queries into predefined categories based on the content.Example: classify({'clean_hello': ['hi', 'hello there'], 'faq_link_accounts_start': ['how do I link my account?', 'link account instructions']}) returns {'clean_hello': ['greeting'], 'faq_link_accounts_start': ['account_linking']}", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["clean_hello", "faq_link_accounts_start"], "properties": {"clean_hello": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "An array of strings containing queries that are casual greetings or informal hellos."}, "faq_link_accounts_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "An array of strings with queries related to linking accounts within the bank's system."}}}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"classify2": {"clean_hello": ["link my account", "connect my accounts", "hello"]}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"classify2": {"clean_hello": ["link my account", "connect my accounts", "hello"]}}], "possible_answer": [{"classify1": {"clean_hello": [["hello"]], "faq_link_accounts_start": [["link my account", "connect my accounts"]]}}, {"classify2": {"clean_hello": [["hello"]], "faq_link_accounts_start": [["link my account", "connect my accounts"]]}}, {"classify3": {"clean_hello": [["hello"]], "faq_link_accounts_start": [["link my account", "connect my accounts"]]}}]}

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees at training time and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. This method is highly effective in handling both regression and classification tasks and is known for its robustness, accuracy, and ability to manage large datasets with higher dimensionality.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **data**: The input dataset on which the Random Forest model will be trained. This dataset should include both features and target variables. It is essential that the data is preprocessed correctly, with any missing values addressed and categorical variables appropriately encoded. The quality and representation of the input data can significantly impact the performance of the trained model.\n\n- **target_variable**: The specific column or feature within the dataset that the model should predict. This target variable can be categorical or continuous, depending on whether the task is classification or regression, respectively.\n\n- **n_estimators (optional)**: The number of trees in the forest. More trees can improve accuracy but also increase computation time. Typically, users might set this parameter to a default like 100 if not specified otherwise.\n\n- **max_depth (optional)**: The maximum depth of each tree. Limiting the depth of the tree helps prevent overfitting. Setting this to `None` allows nodes to expand until all leaves are pure or contain fewer than `min_samples_split` samples.\n\n- **random_state (optional)**: A seed used by the random number generator. Setting a random state ensures reproducible results by initializing the random number generator in the same state every time the code is run.\n\n#### Returns:\n\n- **model**: The trained Random Forest model object. This object encapsulates the learned patterns and rules from the dataset and can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\n```python", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"n_estimators": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of trees in the forest."}, "max_depth": {"type": "integer", "description": "The maximum depth of the tree."}, "data": {"type": "any", "description": "The training data for the model."}}, "required": ["n_estimators", "max_depth", "data"]}}, {"name": "random_forest.train2", "description": "Train a Random Forest Model on given dataExample: random_forest.train(n_estimators=100, max_depth=10, data=training_data)", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"n_estimators": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of trees in the forest."}, "max_depth": {"type": "integer", "description": "The maximum depth of the tree."}, "data": {"type": "any", "description": "The training data for the model."}}, "required": ["n_estimators", "max_depth", "data"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "Error during inference: name 'my_data' is not defined", "model_result_decoded": [], "possible_answer": [{"random_forest.train1": {"n_estimators": [100], "max_depth": [5], "data": ["my_data"]}}, {"random_forest.train2": {"n_estimators": [100], "max_depth": [5], "data": ["my_data"]}}, {"random_forest.train3": {"n_estimators": [100], "max_depth": [5], "data": ["my_data"]}}]}

Allows for the bulk recording of query classifications in one function call.This function is designed to efficiently manage and record the classification of a large number of queries by associating them with specific intent names. It achieves this by leveraging keyword arguments, where each keyword corresponds to an intent name, and the associated value is a collection of queries that share this intent. By using this approach, users can perform bulk recordings of query classifications in a single function call, significantly streamlining the process.\n\n### Parameters\n\n- **intent_name**: Keyword arguments where each keyword represents the name of an intent. This acts as a label that describes the purpose or goal of the queries associated with it.\n\n- **queries**: The values that accompany each intent name keyword argument. These are the actual queries that need to be classified. They can be provided in various iterable forms, such as lists or tuples, allowing for flexibility in input data structures.\n\n### Functionality\n\nWhen you call this function, it processes each keyword argument, taking the name of the keyword as the intent and the corresponding value as the list of queries. The function then records the association between each query and its intent, effectively classifying them in bulk. This method is particularly useful for applications that require organizing a large number of queries systematically, such as natural language processing tasks, chatbots, or automated customer service systems.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- If no queries are provided for a given intent, the function will simply record the intent with an empty list of queries, ensuring that all intents are processed but without any associated data.\n  \n- If duplicate queries are provided under the same intent, the function will still record each instance, as this might be intentional depending on the use case (e.g., tracking frequency of certain queries).\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\n# Example of how to call the function with multiple intents and their associated queries\nrecord_classifications(\n    greeting=[\"Hello\", \"Hi there\", \"Good morning\"],\n    farewell=[\"Goodbye\", \"See you later\", \"Take care\"],\n    inquiry=[\"What's the weather", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["acc_routing_start", "atm_finder_start", "faq_link_accounts_start", "get_balance_start", "get_transactions_start", "outofscope"], "properties": {"acc_routing_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries requesting the bank routing numbers or account numbers."}, "atm_finder_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for locations of ATMs, specified in the format of 'City, State (abbr)', such as 'Berkeley, CA' or 'New York, NY'."}, "faq_link_accounts_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to linking accounts within the bank's system."}, "get_balance_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for account balances, available funds, or other financial balances."}, "get_transactions_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to viewing transactions, deposits, purchases, and transaction details."}, "outofscope": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries that do not classify to any other available intents."}}}}, {"name": "record2", "description": "Records classifications for a series of queries based on the intent names provided as keyword arguments.

It utilizes the `os.system()` function, which is part of the Python standard library's `os` module. This function allows the execution of shell commands directly from a Python script, providing a way to interact with the operating system's command line interface.\n\nWhen calling this function, it is important to ensure that the command you provide is formatted correctly as a string. This string represents the exact command you would type into the Windows Command Prompt. The `os.system()` function will then pass this string to the operating system's command processor, where it is executed as if it had been entered manually.\n\nFor example, if you wish to execute the `dir` command to list directory contents, you would use the function as follows: `os.system(\"dir\")`. This effectively opens a new command shell, executes the `dir` command, and then returns the control back to the Python script upon completion of the command.\n\nIt's important to note that `os.system()` is a simple way to execute commands but may not be suitable for all use cases, especially when capturing the command's output is necessary. In such cases, using more advanced modules like `subprocess` might be preferable.\n\nAdditionally, the function's return value is the exit status of the command executed. Typically, a return value of `0` indicates success, while any other value suggests an error occurred. This behavior aligns with the convention used in shell scripting where the command's exit status can be used for conditional logic based on the success or failure of the executed command.\n\nCare should be taken with the input command to avoid security risks, such as command injection, especially if the command string includes user-generated input.

The `os.system()` function allows Python code to interact with the underlying operating system to execute commands as if they were being run from the command prompt.\n\nWhen utilizing this function, you can execute a single command directly.

The calculation is based on three crucial parameters: the distance traveled by the vehicle in that year, the type of fuel the vehicle uses, and the fuel efficiency of the vehicle.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n1. **Distance Traveled**: This parameter represents the total number of miles or kilometers the vehicle has traveled in a year. It is a critical factor, as greater distances typically result in higher emissions.\n\n2. **Fuel Type**: The type of fuel the vehicle uses significantly impacts the calculation. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, electric, and hybrid options. Each fuel type has a specific carbon emissions factor, which denotes the amount of carbon dioxide produced per unit of fuel consumed. This emissions factor is essential for accurately estimating the vehicle's carbon footprint.\n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency**: This represents how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel, usually expressed in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). Higher fuel efficiency indicates that the vehicle can travel further on a smaller amount of fuel, potentially reducing the total emissions.\n\n**Calculation Process:**\n\nThe function combines these parameters to estimate the annual carbon dioxide emissions. It considers the distance traveled and divides it by the vehicle's fuel efficiency to determine the total fuel consumed over the year. This result is then multiplied by the carbon emissions factor associated with the selected fuel type to calculate the total emissions in terms of carbon dioxide.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n- If the distance traveled is zero, the function should correctly return zero emissions, as no travel means no fuel consumption or emissions.\n- If the fuel efficiency is excessively high, it could result in minimal emissions even for significant travel distances, which should be correctly processed.\n- Different fuel types with different emissions factors must be handled accurately to reflect real-world differences in carbon output.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\nSuppose a vehicle travels 15,000 kilometers in", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"distance": {"type": "integer", "description": "The distance travelled in miles."}, "fuel_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of fuel used by the vehicle."}, "fuel_efficiency": {"type": "float", "description": "The vehicle's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon."}, "efficiency_reduction": {"type": "integer", "description": "The percentage decrease in fuel efficiency per year (optional).

It seamlessly integrates with Spotify's API to deliver a smooth user experience, ensuring that users can find and listen to music efficiently.\n\n#### Detailed Functionality\n\n1. **Query Input**: \n   - The function accepts a single input parameter, typically a string, which serves as the search query. This query can be the song's title, artist's name, album, or even a combination thereof. For optimal results, users should ensure that the query is as specific as possible to increase the chances of finding the desired track.\n\n2. **Search Mechanism**:\n   - Upon receiving the query, the function initiates a search process by interfacing with Spotify's extensive music database via its API. This involves sending the query string to Spotify's search endpoint, which then returns a list of tracks that match the criteria.\n   - The function is capable of handling a variety of input formats, such as full song titles, partial titles, or artist names. However, ambiguous or overly broad queries might return multiple results or none at all.\n\n3. **Selection and Playback**:\n   - Once the search results are obtained, the function proceeds to select a track. The selection process may involve choosing the first result or applying additional logic to determine the most relevant track, depending on the implementation specifics.\n   - After a track is selected, the function commands Spotify to play the track. This step involves communicating with the Spotify API to control playback, which may require authorization and proper API credentials from the user.\n\n#### Considerations and Edge Cases\n\n- **Authorization**: \n  - Users must have a valid Spotify account and be authorized to access Spotify's API. This typically involves OAuth 2.0 authentication, which ensures that the function has the necessary permissions to search and play music.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["query"], "properties": {"query": {"type": "string", "description": "The search query for the song, including track and artist information, in the format 'track:SongName artist:ArtistName', such as 'track:Doxy artist:Miles Davis'."}, "shuffle": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Indicates whether to play the songs in shuffle mode, use default if not specified", "default": false}, "volume": {"type": "integer", "description": "The volume level to set when playing the song, expressed as a percentage from 0 to 100m, use default if not specified", "default": 50}}}}, {"name": "play_spotify_song2", "description": "This function searches for a song on Spotify using a provided query and plays the selected trackExample: play_spotify_song(query='track:Shape of You artist:Ed Sheeran')\n\nExample: play_spotify_song(query='track:Bohemian Rhapsody artist:Queen', shuffle=True, volume=75)", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["query"], "properties": {"query": {"type": "string", "description": "The search query for the song, including track and artist information, in the format 'track:SongName artist:ArtistName', such as 'track:Doxy artist:Miles Davis'."}, "shuffle": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Indicates whether to play the songs in shuffle mode, use default if not specified", "default": false}, "volume": {"type": "integer", "description": "The volume level to set when playing the song, expressed as a percentage from 0 to 100m, use default if not specified", "default": 50}}}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"play_spotify_song1": {"query": "Friends Marshmello"}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"play_spotify_song1": {"query": "Friends Marshmello"}}], "possible_answer": [{"play_spotify_song1": {"query": ["track:Friends artist:Marshmello"], "shuffle": ["", false], "volume": ["", 50]}}, {"play_spotify_song2": {"query": ["track:Friends artist:Marshmello"], "shuffle": ["", false], "volume": ["", 50]}}, {"play_spotify_song3": {"query": ["track:Friends artist:Marshmello"], "shuffle": ["", false], "volume": ["", 50]}}]}

By leveraging the powerful search capabilities of Spotify, the function allows users to input a query that can include parts of the song title, artist name, album, or other related metadata. Upon receiving the query, the function initiates a search within Spotify's extensive music library to find the best match or list of matches that correspond to the user's input.\n\nOnce the function identifies the correct song from the search results, it proceeds to play the song through the Spotify platform. The function ensures that the song is played using the user's Spotify account, provided that the account is authenticated and has the necessary permissions to play music through the service.\n\n#### Parameter Explanation\n\n- **query**: The query parameter is a string that represents the search term or terms the user wishes to use to find a song on Spotify. This can be a fragment or complete song title, the artist's name, album name, or a combination thereof. The query should be formulated to maximize the accuracy of the search results.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\nSuppose a user wants to listen to \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by Queen. The user can call the function with the query parameter set to \"Bohemian Rhapsody Queen\" or simply \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" to search for the song. The function will then search Spotify's library, identify the track, and proceed to play it.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n\n- If the query does not correspond to any identifiable song, the function should handle this scenario gracefully, possibly by returning an error message or prompt indicating that no match was found.\n- If multiple songs match the query closely, the function may either play the first result or prompt the user to choose from a list of possible matches.\n- The function requires an active internet connection and a valid Spotify account with streaming permissions to function correctly.

It is important to note that the function only returns the name of the president who was in office at any point during the specified year, regardless of whether the individual began or ended their term during that year. For instance, if the year provided is an election year or a year in which a presidential transition occurred, the function will identify the president who was sworn into office during that time.\n\nTo use the function, you would typically pass an integer value representing the year of interest as an argument.

This parameter is crucial as it narrows down the search to a specific geographic location, ensuring that the recommendations are relevant to the user's needs.\n\n- The second parameter, `review_rate`, is a numeric value that determines the minimum average review rating that a sushi place must have to be considered in the results. This parameter helps filter out sushi restaurants that do not meet a certain quality standard, as perceived by previous customers. It ensures that only sushi places with a review rating equal to or higher than this specified value are included in the final output.\n\n- The third parameter, `top number`, is an integer that indicates the number of top sushi places to return. This parameter allows users to limit the number of results based on their preference. For example, if a user only wants to see the top 5 sushi places, they would set this parameter to 5. The function then provides a list containing the specified number of sushi restaurants, ranked according to their ratings and other relevant criteria.\n\nBy combining these parameters, the function is able to generate a tailored list of sushi restaurants that are highly regarded within the specified city and meet or exceed the given review rate. The output is a concise list that matches the user's requirements, limited to the top establishments as defined by the `top number` parameter.\n\nUsage Example:\nSuppose a user wants to find the best sushi places in \"San Francisco\" with a minimum average review rating of 4.5 and wishes to see the top 3 results.

This information is crucial to filter available hotels and ensure accurate booking in the preferred destination.\n\n- The `date` parameter, usually formatted as a string or date object, indicates the exact day on which the reservation is to begin.

This can affect the reservation cost and the type of room required, as family rooms or rooms with additional beds might be necessary.\n\nEdge cases to consider include ensuring that the city and date inputs are valid and match the hotel's operational parameters.

This conversion is executed by applying the current exchange rate, which reflects the relative value between the two currencies at the time of conversion. The function requires several parameters to operate effectively:\n\n1. **Amount**: This parameter represents the monetary value in the base currency that you aim to convert. It is typically expressed as a numerical value, which could be an integer or a floating-point number, depending on the level of precision desired.\n\n2. **Base Currency**: This parameter denotes the original currency of the amount you are converting from. It is usually specified using a standard three-letter currency code, such as USD for United States Dollar, EUR for Euro, or JPY for Japanese Yen.\n\n3. **Target Currency**: This parameter specifies the currency into which you wish to convert the amount. Similar to the base currency, it is identified by a three-letter currency code.\n\n4. **Exchange Rate**: This is the current exchange rate between the base currency and the target currency. It is a crucial factor in the conversion process, as it determines how much of the target currency you will receive for a given amount of the base currency. The exchange rate can fluctuate due to various economic factors and is typically obtained from financial institutions or currency exchange platforms.\n\nThe function will compute the equivalent value in the target currency by multiplying the amount in the base currency by the current exchange rate. In cases where precision is essential, the function might also incorporate mechanisms to handle rounding, ensuring that the result is as accurate as possible within the constraints of the currencies involved.\n\nAn example usage of this function might involve converting 100 USD to EUR, given an exchange rate of 0.85. By passing these parameters into the function, it would calculate and return the equivalent amount in Euros, which in this example would be 85 EUR. Additionally, the function may include error handling to manage potential issues such", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"base_currency": {"type": "string", "description": "The currency to convert from."}, "target_currency": {"type": "string", "description": "The currency to convert to."}, "amount": {"type": "integer", "description": "The amount in base currency to convert"}}, "required": ["base_currency", "target_currency", "amount"]}}, {"name": "currency_exchange.convert2", "description": "Convert an amount from a base currency to a target currency based on the current exchange rate.Example: currency_exchange.convert(base_currency='USD', target_currency='EUR', amount=100) returns 85.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"base_currency": {"type": "string", "description": "The currency to convert from."}, "target_currency": {"type": "string", "description": "The currency to convert to."}, "amount": {"type": "integer", "description": "The amount in base currency to convert"}}, "required": ["base_currency", "target_currency", "amount"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"currency_exchange.convert1": {"base_currency": "CAD", "target_currency": "USD", "amount": 500}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"currency_exchange.convert1": {"base_currency": "CAD", "target_currency": "USD", "amount": 500}}], "possible_answer": [{"currency_exchange.convert1": {"base_currency": ["USD"], "target_currency": ["CAD"], "amount": [500]}}, {"currency_exchange.convert2": {"base_currency": ["USD"], "target_currency": ["CAD"], "amount": [500]}}, {"currency_exchange.convert3": {"base_currency": ["USD"], "target_currency": ["CAD"], "amount": [500]}}]}

It calculates these details based on the most efficient route, typically considering factors such as road conditions, traffic patterns, and any applicable speed limits.\n\n### Parameters:\n- **Starting Location**: The initial point or address from where the journey begins. This can be specified using geographic coordinates, such as latitude and longitude, or an address string in a recognized format.\n  \n- **Destination Location**: The endpoint or target address of the journey. Similar to the starting location, this can be provided as geographic coordinates or a formatted address string.\n\n### Return Values:\n- **Travel Distance**: The total length of the journey measured in miles or kilometers, depending on the preferred unit of measurement specified by the user or the default settings of the function. This distance represents the actual road network path rather than a straight line between the two points.\n\n- **Estimated Travel Time**: The projected duration of the trip, typically expressed in hours and minutes. This estimate factors in average traffic conditions that might be encountered during the journey, as well as typical speed limits on the route.\n\n### Usage Example:\nTo effectively use this function, the user might input the starting location as \"1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA\" and the destination as \"1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, CA\". The function would then output the travel distance, for instance, \"45 miles\", and the estimated travel time, such as \"1 hour 15 minutes\", assuming traffic is average. \n\n### Edge Cases:\nThe accuracy of the travel distance and estimated travel time might vary depending on real-time traffic updates or road closures, which may not be reflected unless the function is integrated with a live traffic data source.
