If optional 'root_type' is 'real', the function will only return real roots. If not specified, function may return complex roots.The function is designed to solve a quadratic equation, which is a polynomial equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where 'a', 'b', and 'c' are known coefficients. The function takes these coefficients as input parameters, allowing it to calculate the roots of the equation. Typically, the roots of a quadratic equation are obtained using the quadratic formula: x = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a. \n\nThe function also provides optional functionality to specify the type of roots returned through the 'root_type' parameter. By default, or if 'root_type' is unspecified, the function will compute both real and complex roots, depending on the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac). When the discriminant is positive, the roots are real and distinct. If the discriminant is zero, the roots are real and equal. However, if the discriminant is negative, the function will return complex roots, which include imaginary numbers.\n\nWhen the 'root_type' parameter is explicitly set to 'real', the function is constrained to return only real roots. In this case, if the discriminant is negative, the function might return an indication that there are no real roots, as complex solutions involve imaginary numbers and are thus not considered 'real'.\n\nFor practical usage, users can call the function by providing the coefficients 'a', 'b', and 'c' as arguments. If they wish to ensure only real roots are returned, they should also supply 'root_type' with the value 'real'.

This behavior ensures that the absence of a valid answer is clearly communicated by the function's output.\n\nTo illustrate, consider a practical example: suppose an LLM is queried for specific data or insights.

In this context, the entropy change quantitatively represents the measure of disorder or randomness introduced into a system when it undergoes a transformation. For an isothermal process, the temperature remains constant throughout the process. This distinct feature allows us to simplify the evaluation of entropy change since temperature is a crucial factor in thermodynamic calculations.\n\nFor a reversible process, the system transitions between states in such a manner that the system and its surroundings can be returned to their original states without any net change, implying an idealized process with maximum efficiency and no entropy production. The formula for calculating entropy change (\\(\\Delta S\\)) during an isothermal and reversible process is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta S = \\frac{Q_{\\text{rev}}}{T}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\Delta S\\) is the change in entropy.\n- \\(Q_{\\text{rev}}\\) is the heat absorbed or released by the system during the reversible process.\n- \\(T\\) is the absolute temperature at which the process occurs, maintained constant.\n\nIt is crucial to ensure that the heat \\(Q_{\\text{rev}}\\) is measured in a reversible context because irreversibilities would lead to additional entropy changes not accounted for in this idealized computation.\n\nConsider an example involving the compression or expansion of an ideal gas. If an ideal gas is compressed or expanded isothermally and reversibly, one can calculate the entropy change by determining the heat exchanged with the surroundings, using the ideal gas law to relate variables appropriately.\n\nExample:\nSuppose an ideal gas is expanded isothermally and reversibly at a constant temperature of 300 K, and the heat absorbed by the system is 500 J.

The function should include validation to ensure that these cases are managed gracefully, providing informative error messages or exceptions to the user.\n\nIn summary, this function is a robust tool for managing event schedules across different time zones by accurately relocating an event to a new designated time while accounting for timezone variations.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["identifier", "dateOrTime"], "properties": {"identifier": {"type": "string", "description": "A unique identifier for the event to be rescheduled."}, "dateOrTime": {"type": "string", "description": "The new date and time to which the event should be moved, in ISO-8601 format (e.g., 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ').

This function plays a crucial role for investors seeking to forecast their potential earnings from a mutual fund over a specific time frame.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n1. **Yearly Yield**: This parameter represents the annual percentage increase in the value of the mutual fund. It is typically expressed as a decimal fraction (e.g., a 5% yield would be expressed as 0.05). The yearly yield is a critical factor as it determines how much the investment is expected to grow each year.\n\n2. **Investment Amount**: This is the initial amount of money invested in the mutual fund. The investment amount is the principal sum on which the returns are calculated. A higher initial investment generally results in higher total returns, assuming the yield remains constant.\n\n3. **Time Period**: This parameter specifies the duration for which the investment will be held, typically measured in years. The time period is fundamental in compounding calculations, as it determines how many times the yield is applied to the investment.\n\n**Functionality and Edge Cases:**\n\nThe function calculates the estimated return by applying the compound interest formula, which considers the effect of the yearly yield over the specified time period. It assumes that the yield is compounded annually, and the returns are reinvested at the same rate. \n\nIn scenarios where the time period is zero, the function should return the initial investment amount, as no time has passed for the yield to be applied. Similarly, if the yearly yield is zero, the return will simply equal the initial investment amount, because no growth occurs without yield, regardless of the time period.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```python\n# Example: Estimating the return on a mutual fund investment\nyearly_yield = 0.07  # 7% annual yield\ninvestment_amount =", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"yearly_yield": {"type": "float", "description": "The yearly yield of the mutual fund as a percentage."}, "investment_amount": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial investment amount in the mutual fund."}, "years": {"type": "integer", "description": "The time period for which the investment is made in years."}}, "required": ["yearly_yield", "investment_amount", "years"]}}, {"name": "estimate_mutual_fund_return2", "description": "Calculate the estimated return on a mutual fund given the yearly yield, the investment amount and the time period.Want to figure out how much money you might make from a mutual fund?

This will first change the current working directory to the specified path and then execute the `dir` command to list the files and directories within that path, provided the directory change is successful.\n\nIt is important to note that the `os.system()` function will return the exit status of the command executed, which can be used to determine whether the command was successful (typically returning zero) or if an error occurred (returning a non-zero value). Additionally, while using `os.system()`, the system shell is invoked, which means command execution can be susceptible to shell injection if inputs are not properly sanitized.\n\nKeep in mind the following when using this function:\n- It is specifically intended for use on Windows operating systems.\n- The function can execute multiple commands chained with '&&', ensuring subsequent commands are dependent on the success of prior ones.\n- The output of the executed commands is typically directed to the standard output and standard error streams of the shell, rather than being captured", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.This function is used to execute a system-level command on Windows operating systems by utilizing the `os.system()` method provided by Python's `os` module. The `os.system()` function is designed to pass a command string directly to the operating system's command interpreter. On Windows, this is typically the Command Prompt (cmd.exe). The command string can consist of a single command or multiple commands that are concatenated using the logical AND operator `&&`.

This allows for direct interaction with the Windows command line interface, enabling the execution of commands as if they were being run manually by a user in a Command Prompt session.\n\nThis functionality supports the execution of a single command or multiple commands that are chained together using the '&&' operator. The '&&' operator in this context is used to concatenate multiple commands in such a way that each subsequent command is executed only if the preceding one succeeds. This means that if one command fails (returns a non-zero exit status), the following commands in the chain will not be executed. \n\nWhen using this function, it's important to ensure that the commands are properly formatted and compatible with the Windows command line syntax. The commands are passed as a single string argument to `os.system()`, which then interprets and executes them in the Windows environment. An example of a single command execution would be `os.system(\"dir\")`, which lists the directory contents. For multiple commands, you could use something like `os.system(\"cd C:\\\\ && dir\")`, which first changes the directory to the C: drive root and then lists its contents.\n\nIt is crucial to consider security implications, such as the potential for command injection if user input is incorporated into the command string. Proper validation and sanitization of inputs should be employed to mitigate such risks.

This function is part of the `os` module, which provides a way to interface with the underlying operating system. The command to be executed should be passed as a string argument to this function. \n\nWhen dealing with multiple commands that need to be executed sequentially, you can concatenate them into a single command string by separating each individual command with the '&&' operator. This operator ensures that the subsequent command will only run if the previous command succeeds without errors. This is particularly useful for chaining commands where the output or success of one command is dependent on the execution of the preceding one.\n\nHowever, when the tasks you wish to perform are more complex or if there is a need for a more robust solution, it is advisable to create a batch file (.bat). A batch file can contain multiple lines of commands and supports more complex scripting logic, such as loops and conditional statements. Once the batch file is created, you can execute it using the `os.system()` function by providing the path to the .bat file as the command argument.\n\nThis method is specifically tailored for Windows operating systems, as the `os.system()` function behaves differently across different platforms, and batch file execution is a Windows-specific concept. \n\nHere is a simple example to illustrate:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Example of executing a single command\nos.system('echo Hello, World!')\n\n# Example of executing multiple commands\nos.system('echo First Command && echo Second Command')\n\n# Example of executing a batch file\nos.system('path_to_your_batch_file.bat')\n```\n\nIn this example, the `echo` command is used to print messages to the console.

This function leverages the Spotify API to perform its tasks efficiently and effectively.\n\n#### Parameters\n- **query** (string): A string representing the search terms for the desired song. This can include the song title, artist name, or other relevant keywords that will help in locating the specific track on Spotify.\n\n#### Functionality\nUpon invocation, the function initiates a search operation using the provided query. It communicates with the Spotify database to identify the best match for the input search terms. Once the search operation is complete and a song is identified, the function proceeds to play the song. This involves sending a command to Spotify's playback services to start streaming the identified track.\n\n#### Edge Cases and Considerations\n- If the query does not match any song records in Spotify's database, the function may not be able to play a song. Implementing error handling for such scenarios is advisable to provide feedback to the user.\n- The user must have an active Spotify account with appropriate permissions to play songs. Additionally, depending on the Spotify API's constraints, authentication and authorization might be required to access the playback functionality.\n- Network connectivity is necessary for both searching for the song and streaming it.\n\n#### Usage Example\n```python\n# Example usage of the search_and_play_song_on_spotify function.\nquery = \"Imagine John Lennon\"\nsearch_and_play_song_on_spotify(query)\n```\n\nIn this example, the function is used to search for and play the song \"Imagine\" by John Lennon.

The progression will consist of a predetermined number of chords. Chord progressions are fundamental to the structure of music, providing the harmonic foundation upon which melodies and rhythms are built. By specifying both the key and the number of chords, users can tailor the progression to fit the mood and style they are aiming to achieve in their composition.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n- **Key**: This parameter determines the tonal center of the chord progression. It specifies the scale from which the chords will be derived. The key can be any of the 12 major or minor keys commonly used in Western music. For example, choosing a key of C major means that the generated chords will be based on the C major scale, which includes the notes C, D, E, F, G, A, and B.\n\n- **Number of Chords**: This parameter defines how many chords will make up the progression. The number can vary depending on the desired complexity and length of the musical piece. For instance, a simple chord progression might consist of four chords, which is a typical structure used in many pop and rock songs. More elaborate compositions might utilize eight or more chords to create intricate harmonic progressions.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\nSuppose you want to create a simple four-chord progression in the key of G major. You would call the function with \"G major\" as the key and \"4\" as the number of chords. The function would then output a progression using chords from the G major scale, such as G, C, D, and Em.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n\n- **Key not specified**: If the key is not specified, the function might default to a common key such as C major, which is often used since it contains no sharps or flats, making it straightforward for beginners.\n\n- **Number of", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"key": {"type": "string", "description": "The key for the chord progression."}, "chords": {"type": "integer", "description": "Number of chords in the progression."}, "progression_type": {"type": "string", "description": "The type of the chord progression.

The function may also provide additional item details such as price, description, and any applicable discounts, although the primary emphasis is on availability status. \n\nParameters required could include the unique identifier for each Walmart item, such as a SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) or UPC (Universal Product Code), to ensure accurate retrieval of data. Additionally, the function might connect to Walmart's API or a similar data source, necessitating appropriate authentication credentials or API keys to access and pull inventory information.\n\nPotential use cases for this function include checking stock levels before making a purchase, integrating with an e-commerce platform to display current item availability, or managing inventory for resellers who depend on Walmart's stock data. \n\nEdge cases to consider might involve handling situations where the item identifier does not match any current listing, in which the function should appropriately return a null or error message. Similarly, if the connection to the data source fails, the function should include error handling to manage such scenarios gracefully, possibly by retrying the connection or notifying the user of the issue.\n\nAn example usage of this function could be as follows:\n\n```python\n# Example pseudo-code\nitem_info = get_walmart_item_info(item_id=\"1234567890\")\nprint(f\"Item Name: {item_info['name']}\")\nprint(f\"Availability: {item_info['availability_status']}\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `get_walmart_item_info` is called with a specific item ID, and the returned data is used to print out the item's name and its availability status, demonstrating how the function can be integrated into larger systems or used for quick checks of item information.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"loc": {"type": "string", "description": "Location of the nearest Walmart."}, "product_list": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "Items to be purchased listed in an array."}, "pack_size": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "integer"}, "description": "Size of the product pack if applicable.

This ensures that the accommodation meets the guest's requirements and preferences.\n\nIn addition to selecting the room type, users must also specify the number of nights they intend to stay. This duration information is crucial as it determines both the cost of the stay and the availability of the room over the desired period. The system calculates the total length of the stay by counting the specified number of nights from the check-in date to the check-out date.\n\nMoreover, users need to identify the particular hotel where they wish to make the reservation. This could involve selecting from a list of available hotels or directly specifying the hotel by name or location, depending on the implementation of the function. The selected hotel must have the desired room type available for the entire duration of the stay.\n\nFinally, the reservation start date must be specified, indicating the day on which the booking should commence.
