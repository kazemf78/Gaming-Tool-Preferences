It is important to note that this function is restricted to sending just one value at a time, ensuring that the command received is clear and unambiguous. This limitation is particularly useful when precise control is required over the appliance's operations, as it prevents any potential conflicts that could arise from sending multiple commands simultaneously.\n\n### Usage Example\n\nSuppose you are working with a smart home system where you need to adjust the temperature setting on a smart thermostat. Using this function, you can send a specific temperature value, such as 72 degrees Fahrenheit, to the thermostat. The function call would look something like this:\n\n```python\nsend_command_to_appliance(72)\n```\n\nIn this example, `72` represents the single value being sent to control the appliance.\n\n### Parameter Explanation\n\n- **value (int/float/string)**: The command value to be sent to the appliance. This parameter represents the exact instruction the appliance will receive. Depending on the appliance's capabilities, this value could be an integer, a floating-point number, or even a specific string command understood by the appliance.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- **Invalid Values**: If the value sent is not recognized by the appliance, it may result in an error or the appliance may ignore the command altogether. It is crucial to ensure that the value conforms to the expected input range or format for the appliance being controlled.\n- **Network Issues**: In scenarios where the command relies on network communication, issues such as connectivity problems or latency might affect the successful transmission of the command. It is advisable to include error-checking mechanisms to confirm the command was successfully received and executed by the appliance.\n\nOverall, the function provides a streamlined method for issuing a single, distinct command to an appliance, making it an essential tool for tasks that require direct and specific control.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["body"], "properties": {"body": {"type": "dict", "description": "A dictionary containing the parameters for the appliance command.", "properties": {"airConJobMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The current job mode of the air conditioner.", "enum": ["AIR_CLEAN", "COOL", "AIR_DRY"], "default": "COOL"}, "windStrength": {"type": "string", "description": "The strength of the air flow.", "enum": ["LOW", "HIGH", "MID"], "default": "MID"}, "monitoringEnabled": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether air quality sensor monitoring is enabled.", "default": false}, "airCleanOperationMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The operation mode for the air cleaning function.", "enum": ["START", "STOP"], "default": "STOP"}, "airConOperationMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The operation mode for the air conditioner, indicating if it is turned on or off.", "enum": ["POWER_ON", "POWER_OFF"], "default": "POWER_OFF"}, "powerSaveEnabled": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether power save mode is enabled to conserve energy.", "default": false}, "targetTemperature": {"type": "integer", "description": "The target temperature to set for the appliance, in degrees Celsius.", "default": 20}, "relativeHourToStop": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of hours from the current time when the appliance should stop.

The function assumes that weight is given in kilograms and height in meters, as these units are standard for calculating body mass index (BMI), a common metric used in health assessments. \n\nThe prediction process typically involves calculating the BMI from the given inputs using the formula: BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) ^ 2). The resulting BMI value is then assessed against established medical thresholds or criteria that categorize different levels of diabetes risk. These thresholds are derived from epidemiological data correlating BMI with the prevalence of type 2 diabetes.\n\nSpecial attention should be given to ensure that the input values are within a realistic range for accurate predictions. For example, weights should be within human physiological limits, typically between 30 kg and 300 kg, and heights should be between 1.0 m and 2.5 m.

When invoked, the function will systematically compare the elements within the list and rearrange them according to the specified order. \n\nFor ascending order, the elements will be sorted from the smallest to the largest value. Conversely, for descending order, the elements will be sorted from the largest to the smallest value. By default, if no specific order is indicated, the function will typically sort the list in ascending order. \n\nThe function is versatile and can handle lists containing various comparable data types, such as numbers, strings, or other sortable objects. However, it is important to ensure that all elements within the list are of compatible types to avoid runtime errors. For example, attempting to sort a list containing a mix of strings and numbers may lead to unexpected behavior unless explicitly handled.\n\nTo use this function effectively, users should pass the list they wish to sort as the primary argument. Additionally, they can specify a boolean parameter to indicate the desired sorting order. A 'true' value for this parameter will typically denote ascending order, while a 'false' value will specify descending order, although the exact implementation may vary.\n\nHere is a usage example for clarity:\n\n```python\nmy_list = [4, 1, 3, 5, 2]\nsorted_list = sort_list(my_list, ascending=True)  # Sorts in ascending order: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nsorted_list_descending = sort_list(my_list, ascending=False)  # Sorts in descending order: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n```\n\nIn this example, `sort_list` is the function being utilized to order `my_list`. By specifying `ascending=True`, the function arranges the list from the lowest to the highest value. Conversely, setting `ascending=False` reverses the order.\n\nUsers should consult the function", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"list": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "float"}, "description": "The list of numbers to be sorted."}, "order": {"type": "string", "enum": ["ascending", "descending"], "description": "Order of sorting."}}, "required": ["list", "order"]}}, {"name": "array_sort2", "description": "Sorts a given list in ascending or descending order.

It is essential for organizations that handle a high volume of customer interactions, as it enables them to organize, analyze, and manage these queries effectively. \n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- **Query ID:** A unique identifier for each customer service query that needs to be classified. This ensures that each entry in the system can be uniquely tracked and referenced.\n\n- **Classification Type:** A predefined category or label assigned to the customer service query. This classification helps in sorting the queries into different types for easier management and analysis. Examples of classifications might include 'Billing Issue,' 'Technical Support,' 'Product Inquiry,' or 'Feedback.'\n\n- **Timestamp:** The date and time when the query was classified. This is crucial for maintaining an accurate timeline of when queries are processed and addressed.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n- If a query does not match any existing classification type, there should be a default classification to ensure no queries remain unclassified, or the system should prompt for the creation of a new classification category.\n\n- In cases where a query is reclassified, the system should update the classification record accordingly to reflect the most current category, potentially retaining the history of changes for auditing purposes.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\nImagine a scenario where a customer calls with a complaint about a delayed shipment. The customer service representative would use this function to assign the query a unique ID, classify it under the 'Shipping Issue' category, and record the exact time at which the classification was made. This information is then stored in the system for future reference, allowing for trends in shipping issues to be analyzed over time.\n\nBy implementing this function, organizations can enhance their customer service operations, leading to more efficient query management and insightful data analysis, ultimately contributing to improved customer satisfaction.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["money_movement_start", "get_transactions_start", "credit_limit_increase_start", "faq_link_accounts_start"], "properties": {"money_movement_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries for transferring funds between accounts."}, "get_transactions_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries for viewing transactions, including deposits, purchases, and transaction details."}, "credit_limit_increase_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of customer requests to increase credit card limits or complaints about the current limit."}, "faq_link_accounts_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries related to linking accounts within the bank's system."}}}}, {"name": "record2", "description": "Records the classification of specified customer service queries.

Invalid or misspelled intent names may result in misclassification or errors. Additionally, the user should handle scenarios where no intent is provided for a query, as this might require default handling or error reporting within the function.\n\nOverall, this function is a powerful tool for users who need to efficiently manage and record classifications across a wide range of queries.

The calculation is based on three primary factors: the distance the vehicle travels in a year, the type of fuel used by the vehicle, and its fuel efficiency.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n1. **Distance Traveled (annual_distance):** This represents the total distance covered by the vehicle over the course of a year. It is usually measured in miles or kilometers, depending on the preferred unit system. Accurate input of this parameter is crucial as it directly influences the resulting emissions calculation.\n\n2. **Fuel Type (fuel_type):** This denotes the type of fuel the vehicle uses. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, natural gas, and electricity. Different fuels emit varying amounts of CO2 when consumed, and this parameter allows the function to use the appropriate emission factor for the calculation. \n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency (fuel_efficiency):** This is a measure of how effectively a vehicle uses fuel, typically expressed in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). Higher fuel efficiency indicates that the vehicle can travel more distance using less fuel, thus producing fewer emissions for the same distance traveled.\n\n**Calculation Process:**\n\nThe core calculation involves determining the total fuel consumption for the given distance based on the vehicle's fuel efficiency. Once the total fuel consumption is established, the function applies the specific emission factor associated with the fuel type to calculate the total CO2 emissions. The emission factor is a standard value that indicates the amount of CO2 released per unit of fuel consumed.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n- **Extreme Values for Distance:** When calculating emissions for vehicles that travel extremely high or low annual distances, ensure that the inputs remain realistic. For instance, commuting vehicles may have significantly lower distances compared to long-haul trucks.\n\n- **Fuel Efficiency Limits:** Consider edge cases where fuel efficiency is unusually high or", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"distance": {"type": "integer", "description": "The distance travelled in miles."}, "fuel_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of fuel used by the vehicle."}, "fuel_efficiency": {"type": "float", "description": "The vehicle's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon."}, "efficiency_reduction": {"type": "integer", "description": "The percentage decrease in fuel efficiency per year (optional).

For Walmart and its partners, it enables effective supply chain management by tracking inventory levels in real time.\n\nIn terms of usage, this function might take parameters such as item identifiers (like SKU numbers or product IDs) to specify which product's information is being requested. It could also support options to filter or sort the data based on availability, popularity, or other criteria.\n\nThe function's output should clearly indicate the stock status of each queried item, often represented as \"In Stock,\" \"Out of Stock,\" or potentially including quantities available for a more granular view.
