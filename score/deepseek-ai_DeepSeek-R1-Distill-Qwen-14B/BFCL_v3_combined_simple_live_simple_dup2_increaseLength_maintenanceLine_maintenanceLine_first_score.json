The function requires two parameters: the acceleration of the object and the distance it has traveled. \n\nThe final velocity can be determined using the kinematic equation that relates acceleration, distance, and velocity, assuming no initial velocity. The equation used is:\n\n\\[ v^2 = u^2 + 2as \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( v \\) represents the final velocity,\n- \\( u \\) is the initial velocity (which is 0 in this case),\n- \\( a \\) is the constant acceleration,\n- \\( s \\) stands for the distance traveled.\n\nSince the initial velocity \\( u \\) is zero, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ v^2 = 2as \\]\n\nFrom this, the final velocity \\( v \\) can be calculated by rearranging the equation to solve for \\( v \\):\n\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{2as} \\]\n\nThis function assumes that the acceleration remains constant throughout the distance traveled. It also assumes that the motion is in a straight line and occurs under ideal conditions, with no external forces like friction or air resistance affecting the motion.\n\n### Usage Example\n\nTo use this function, provide the acceleration and distance as inputs. For instance, if an object is subjected to an acceleration of 3 meters per second squared (m/s^2) and travels a distance of 50 meters, the function will compute the final velocity as follows:\n\n```python\nacceleration = 3  # m/s^2\ndistance = 50     # meters\nfinal_velocity = calculate_final_velocity(acceleration, distance)\n```\n\nIn this example, the value returned by the function would represent the final velocity of the object after traveling 50 meters under the given acceleration conditions. \n\n### Edge Cases\n\nIt is important to consider edge cases where either the acceleration or the distance might be zero:\n- **Zero acceleration**", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"acceleration": {"type": "integer", "description": "Acceleration of the object, m/s^2."}, "distance": {"type": "integer", "description": "Distance traveled by the object, m."}, "initial_velocity": {"type": "float", "description": "Initial velocity of the object.

This calculation is crucial in thermodynamics to understand how energy is dispersed in such a process without any loss due to irreversibility. \n\nIn an isothermal and reversible process, the change in entropy (\u0394S) is determined using the formula \u0394S = Q/T, where Q represents the heat exchanged during the process and T is the absolute temperature at which the process occurs, expressed in Kelvin.

In practical scenarios, entropy change calculations are typically used for systems where T is significantly greater than 0 K. \n\nUsage Example:\nSuppose a system absorbs 500 J of heat during an isothermal process at a constant temperature of 300 K. The entropy change for this process can be calculated as \u0394S = 500 J / 300 K, which equals approximately 1.67 J/K.

It is important to note that this function is restricted to sending just one value at a time, ensuring that the command received is clear and unambiguous. This limitation is particularly useful when precise control is required over the appliance's operations, as it prevents any potential conflicts that could arise from sending multiple commands simultaneously.\n\n### Usage Example\n\nSuppose you are working with a smart home system where you need to adjust the temperature setting on a smart thermostat. Using this function, you can send a specific temperature value, such as 72 degrees Fahrenheit, to the thermostat. The function call would look something like this:\n\n```python\nsend_command_to_appliance(72)\n```\n\nIn this example, `72` represents the single value being sent to control the appliance.\n\n### Parameter Explanation\n\n- **value (int/float/string)**: The command value to be sent to the appliance. This parameter represents the exact instruction the appliance will receive. Depending on the appliance's capabilities, this value could be an integer, a floating-point number, or even a specific string command understood by the appliance.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- **Invalid Values**: If the value sent is not recognized by the appliance, it may result in an error or the appliance may ignore the command altogether. It is crucial to ensure that the value conforms to the expected input range or format for the appliance being controlled.\n- **Network Issues**: In scenarios where the command relies on network communication, issues such as connectivity problems or latency might affect the successful transmission of the command. It is advisable to include error-checking mechanisms to confirm the command was successfully received and executed by the appliance.\n\nOverall, the function provides a streamlined method for issuing a single, distinct command to an appliance, making it an essential tool for tasks that require direct and specific control.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["body"], "properties": {"body": {"type": "dict", "description": "A dictionary containing the parameters for the appliance command.", "properties": {"airConJobMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The current job mode of the air conditioner.", "enum": ["AIR_CLEAN", "COOL", "AIR_DRY"], "default": "COOL"}, "windStrength": {"type": "string", "description": "The strength of the air flow.", "enum": ["LOW", "HIGH", "MID"], "default": "MID"}, "monitoringEnabled": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether air quality sensor monitoring is enabled.", "default": false}, "airCleanOperationMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The operation mode for the air cleaning function.", "enum": ["START", "STOP"], "default": "STOP"}, "airConOperationMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The operation mode for the air conditioner, indicating if it is turned on or off.", "enum": ["POWER_ON", "POWER_OFF"], "default": "POWER_OFF"}, "powerSaveEnabled": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether power save mode is enabled to conserve energy.", "default": false}, "targetTemperature": {"type": "integer", "description": "The target temperature to set for the appliance, in degrees Celsius.", "default": 20}, "relativeHourToStop": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of hours from the current time when the appliance should stop.

The Hardy-Weinberg Principle provides a foundational framework in population genetics, helping to determine the genetic variation of a population at equilibrium. According to this principle, the frequency of genotypes in a large, randomly-breeding population remains constant from generation to generation in the absence of evolutionary influences.\n\nThe homozygous dominant genotype is represented as \\( p^2 \\) in the Hardy-Weinberg equation, where \\( p \\) is the frequency of the dominant allele in the population.

Returns a list of times in seconds, each representing the occurrence of a significant beat within the audio file.This function is designed to perform a detailed analysis of an audio file with the primary objective of detecting beats. Beats are the rhythmic pulses that occur at regular intervals in a piece of music or audio track, and identifying them accurately is crucial for various applications such as music mixing, tempo estimation, and rhythmic analysis.\n\nThe function begins by examining the entire audio file to identify potential beat occurrences. During this process, it applies an algorithm to detect beats by analyzing the periodic peaks in the audio signal.

This function takes as input the hour and minute of the clock, typically in a 12-hour format, and computes the smallest angle between the hour and minute hands. The angle is calculated in degrees and lies between 0 and 180 degrees, ensuring that the measure is the smallest possible angle rather than the reflex angle.\n\nTo perform this calculation, the function first determines the position of the hour hand based on both the hour and the minute provided. It acknowledges that the hour hand moves as time progresses, not only every hour but also with each passing minute. Specifically, the hour hand moves 0.5 degrees per minute (or 30 degrees per hour). For example, at 3:30, the hour hand is not exactly on the 3 but slightly ahead, at 105 degrees from the 12 o'clock position.\n\nSimilarly, the position of the minute hand is calculated based solely on the minutes given, moving at a rate of 6 degrees per minute. For instance, at 15 minutes past the hour, the minute hand will point at the 3, or 90 degrees from the 12 o'clock position.\n\nThe function calculates the absolute difference between the positions of the hour and minute hands to find the angle between them. If this calculated angle exceeds 180 degrees, the function will subtract it from 360 degrees to find the smallest angle, since the clock is circular, and angles greater than 180 degrees can be measured inversely (economically).\n\nEdge cases handled by the function include times like 12:00, where both hands are perfectly aligned at 0 degrees, or 6:00, where they are directly opposite each other, forming an angle of 180 degrees.

The normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution characterized by its bell-shaped curve, symmetrical around the mean. The function requires two parameters as input: the mean and the standard deviation. \n\nThe mean parameter represents the central tendency of the distribution, where the peak of the curve occurs. It is the point about which the data points are distributed symmetrically, and it determines the location of the center of the distribution on the number line.\n\nThe standard deviation parameter measures the amount of variation or dispersion from the mean. A smaller standard deviation indicates that the data points are closer to the mean, resulting in a steeper and narrower bell curve. Conversely, a larger standard deviation signifies that data points are spread out over a wider range of values, producing a flatter and wider curve.\n\nWhen the function is called, it utilizes the provided mean and standard deviation to calculate and return a random number. This number is randomly selected from within the defined normal distribution, ensuring that the probability of generating a number declines as it moves further from the mean, in accordance with the properties of the normal distribution.\n\nFor example, if the function is invoked with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, it will generate a random number from a standard normal distribution, which is a special case of the normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

This feature enables precise classification and organization of data, which is particularly useful in applications such as natural language processing, user interaction analysis, and automated response systems.\n\nIn practical usage, the function accepts several keyword arguments where each key corresponds to a query, and its value represents the intent name. For example, if you have a series of queries related to customer support interactions, you might use the function to assign intents like \"billing_inquiry\", \"technical_support\", or \"general_feedback\" to each query, thereby tagging them for further processing or analysis.\n\nAn edge case to consider when using this function is ensuring that the intent names provided in the keyword arguments are valid and recognized by the system. Invalid or misspelled intent names may result in misclassification or errors. Additionally, the user should handle scenarios where no intent is provided for a query, as this might require default handling or error reporting within the function.\n\nOverall, this function is a powerful tool for users who need to efficiently manage and record classifications across a wide range of queries. By allowing for bulk operations, it reduces the overhead and potential for error compared to recording each classification individually. It is important for users to familiarize themselves with the expected format and constraints of the keyword arguments to make the most of this function's capabilities.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["acc_routing_start", "atm_finder_start", "faq_link_accounts_start", "get_balance_start", "get_transactions_start", "outofscope"], "properties": {"acc_routing_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries requesting the bank routing numbers or account numbers."}, "atm_finder_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for locations of ATMs, specified in the format of 'City, State (abbr)', such as 'Berkeley, CA' or 'New York, NY'."}, "faq_link_accounts_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to linking accounts within the bank's system."}, "get_balance_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for account balances, available funds, or other financial balances."}, "get_transactions_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to viewing transactions, deposits, purchases, and transaction details."}, "outofscope": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries that do not classify to any other available intents."}}}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\n[record1(outofscope=['what is the weather like'])]", "model_result_decoded": [{"record1": {"outofscope": ["what is the weather like"]}}], "possible_answer": [{"record1": {"acc_routing_start": [], "atm_finder_start": [], "faq_link_accounts_start": [], "get_balance_start": [], "get_transactions_start": [], "outofscope": [["what is the weather like"]]}}, {"record2": {"acc_routing_start": [], "atm_finder_start": [], "faq_link_accounts_start": [], "get_balance_start": [], "get_transactions_start": [], "outofscope": [["what is the weather like"]]}}, {"record3": {"acc_routing_start": [], "atm_finder_start": [], "faq_link_accounts_start": [], "get_balance_start": [], "get_transactions_start": [], "outofscope": [["what is the weather like"]]}}]}

This calculation provides investors with an approximation of the potential gains or returns they might expect over a specified period, assuming constant conditions.\n\n- **Yearly Yield**: This parameter represents the annual percentage return that the mutual fund is expected to generate. It is typically based on past performance or projected future returns and is expressed as a percentage. For instance, a yearly yield of 5% suggests that the investment is expected to grow by 5% each year.\n\n- **Investment Amount**: This is the total initial capital invested in the mutual fund. The function uses this parameter to compute how much the investment will potentially grow over the specified period. For example, an investment of $10,000 acts as the principal amount that will compound according to the yearly yield.\n\n- **Time Period**: This parameter indicates the duration, usually in years, for which the investment will be held in the mutual fund. It determines the number of times the yearly yield will be applied to the investment amount. For example, a time period of 10 years means the investment will compound annually for ten years.\n\nThe function assumes that the yield remains constant throughout the specified period and that no additional investments or withdrawals are made during this time. It does not account for taxes, fees, or inflation, which can affect actual returns. Additionally, it does not consider market volatility or changes in yield rates.

The `os.system()` function provides a means to run shell commands directly from a Python script, allowing interaction with the system shell in a straightforward manner.\n\nFor usage on Windows, this function can execute a single command or multiple commands sequenced together using the logical AND operator '&&'. This chaining with '&&' is significant because it allows for the execution of multiple commands in a single call.

In this example, the command first attempts to change to `some_directory`. If successful, it proceeds to list the directory contents using the `dir` command.\n\nRemember that the `os.system()` call is synchronous, meaning the Python script will wait for the command to complete execution before continuing.

It requires four key parameters: the initial deposit amount, the annual interest rate, the total time the deposit is held, and the frequency of compounding per unit of time. \n\nThe 'initial deposit' parameter represents the principal amount of money placed into the account at the start. The 'interest rate' is expected to be provided as a decimal representing the annual interest rate. For instance, an interest rate of 5% should be expressed as 0.05. The 'time' parameter denotes the total duration for which the investment is held, typically in years. Lastly, the 'number of times the interest is compounded per unit time' specifies how often the interest is calculated and added to the account balance within each time unit, such as annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, daily, etc.\n\nThe compounded interest is computed using the formula: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the future value of the investment/loan, including interest, P is the principal investment amount (initial deposit), r is the annual interest rate (decimal), n is the number of times that interest is compounded per unit year, and t is the time the money is invested or borrowed for, in years.\n\nHere is an example to illustrate usage: Suppose you have an initial deposit of $1,000, an annual interest rate of 5% (0.05 as a decimal), a time period of 10 years, and the interest is compounded monthly (12 times a year).

It is capable of processing and executing not just a single command but also a sequence of commands that are concatenated using the logical AND operator '&&'. \n\nWhen you pass a command or a series of commands to this function, it will initiate a new command shell (cmd.exe) to run the specified instructions. For example, you can execute a simple command like 'dir' to list the contents of a directory, or you can chain multiple commands together such as 'cd C:\\ && dir' to change the current directory to C:\\ and then list its contents. \n\nThe function returns the exit status of the command executed. A return value of 0 typically indicates that the command executed successfully, while a non-zero return value suggests that an error occurred during execution. It is important to note that since this function is intended for use on Windows, it will not behave as expected on other operating systems. Additionally, while using '&&' to chain commands, the execution of subsequent commands depends on the success of the preceding ones; if any command in the chain fails (returns a non-zero exit status), the following commands will not be executed.\n\nUsage example:\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Example of executing a single command\nos.system('echo Hello, World!')\n\n# Example of executing multiple commands\nos.system('cd C:\\\\ && mkdir test_folder && cd test_folder && echo File Created > file.txt')\n```\n\nIn this example, the first command simply prints \"Hello, World!\" to the console. The second example demonstrates a series of operations: navigating to the C:\\ directory, creating a new directory called 'test_folder', changing into this new directory, and finally creating a text file named 'file.txt' with the content \"File Created\".

The `os.system()` function allows for the execution of commands in the underlying operating system's shell environment. This feature is particularly useful for automating tasks that require command-line instructions.\n\nWhen using this function, you can submit a single command for execution, such as launching an application or running a script. Additionally, the function supports the execution of multiple commands in sequence. This is accomplished by chaining commands together using the '&&' operator. The '&&' operator is a logical AND operator used in command-line environments to ensure that each command is executed only if the preceding command completes successfully. Thus, if one command fails, the subsequent commands in the chain will not be executed.\n\nIt's important to note that while this function provides a powerful interface for executing commands, it should be used with caution.

Service types may vary and include options such as cleaning, ironing, and potentially other categories depending on the application's context. The unique identifier serves as a distinct reference that differentiates each service type from others within the system.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n- **serviceType (string)**: This parameter specifies the type of service for which you are seeking the unique identifier. It is essential that the input for this parameter accurately matches a valid service type within the system, such as \"cleaning\" or \"ironing\". Providing a service type that does not exist in the system will not yield a valid identifier, and may result in an error or null response.\n\n#### Return Value\n\n- **string**: The function returns a string value that represents the unique identifier of the specified service type. This identifier is used to uniquely distinguish the service type across various operations within the application, such as querying databases, logging operations, or interfacing with other system components.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\nSuppose you want to retrieve the unique identifier for the \"cleaning\" service type. You would call the function and pass the string \"cleaning\" as an argument. The function would then return a string that is the unique ID for the cleaning service. This ID can be used in subsequent operations that require a reference to the cleaning service type.\n\n```python\n# Example of retrieving the unique identifier for the cleaning service type\ncleaning_service_id = getServiceTypeId(\"cleaning\")\nprint(cleaning_service_id)  # Output might be something like \"svc-001\"\n```\n\n#### Edge Cases\n\n- **Non-existent Service Type**: If a service type is provided that does not exist within the system, the function may return an error or a null value. It is advisable to handle such cases within your code by implementing error checking or default value assignment.\n- **Case Sensitivity**: Depending on the", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["service_id"], "properties": {"service_id": {"type": "integer", "description": "The unique identifier of the service.

Accurate input is essential for retrieving the correct flight information.\n\n- **Passenger's Name**: This parameter refers to the full name of the traveler as it appears on the airline's reservation system. It acts as a secondary verification measure, ensuring that the flight status information corresponds to the correct individual and preventing any mismatches in data retrieval.\n\n- **Ticket Number**: The ticket number is a unique identifier associated with the passenger's booking. It serves as a precise reference point for the airline's database to locate the exact reservation details. The ticket number is typically a numeric string and is crucial for pinpointing the flight among numerous records.\n\nThe function, upon receiving these inputs, interacts with the airline's database or system to fetch the most recent details about the flight linked to the passenger. The current status of the flight may include information such as on-time status, delay notifications, gate information, boarding schedules, or any changes to the original itinerary. Timely and accurate data retrieval is dependent on the precision and correctness of the provided parameters.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\n```python\nflight_status = CheckFlightStatus('AA', 'John Doe', '1234567890')\n# This call checks the current status of a flight booked with American Airlines for the passenger John Doe with the ticket number 1234567890.\n```\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n1. **Incorrect Details**: Providing an incorrect airline code, misspelling the passenger's", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["airlines", "person_name", "ticket_number"], "properties": {"airlines": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the airline for which to check the flight status, such as 'Delta' or 'United'."}, "person_name": {"type": "string", "description": "The full name or first name of the passenger as it appears on the ticket, in the format 'First Last'.

This function is useful for users who want to plan their visits by ensuring they are aware of when the museum is open on the day they intend to visit. To achieve this, the function requires two inputs: the name or identifier of the museum and the specific day for which the opening hours are needed. The day is typically provided in a standard format such as a day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday) or a date format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD) depending on the implementation. \n\nIn terms of edge cases, the function should handle scenarios where the museum is closed on certain days, such as public holidays or maintenance days, and should return an appropriate message indicating that the museum is not open. Additionally, if an invalid museum identifier or an incorrect day format is provided, the function should gracefully handle these errors by returning a meaningful error message or a default response indicating the issue.\n\nUsage of this function involves passing the correct parameters for both the museum and the day. For example, if you wish to find out the opening hours of the \"National Art Museum\" on a Monday, you would call the function with \"National Art Museum\" as the first argument and \"Monday\" as the second argument. The function would then access the relevant data source to fetch and return the opening hours for that specific museum on the specified day. \n\nThis function plays an essential role in applications that serve tourists or local visitors by providing them with the necessary information to make informed decisions about their museum visits, ensuring they arrive during operational hours.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"museum_name": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the museum."}, "day": {"type": "string", "description": "Day of the week.", "enum": ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]}}, "required": ["museum_name", "day"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\n[get_museum_hours1(museum_name=\"Metropolitan Museum of Art\", day=\"Saturday)]", "possible_answer": [{"get_museum_hours1": {"museum_name": ["Metropolitan Museum of Art", "The Met"], "day": ["Saturday"]}}, {"get_museum_hours2": {"museum_name": ["Metropolitan Museum of Art", "The Met"], "day": ["Saturday"]}}, {"get_museum_hours3": {"museum_name": ["Metropolitan Museum of Art", "The Met"], "day": ["Saturday"]}}]}
