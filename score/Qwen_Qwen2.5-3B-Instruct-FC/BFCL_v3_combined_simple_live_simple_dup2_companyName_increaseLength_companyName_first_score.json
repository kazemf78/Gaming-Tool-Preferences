This single-value constraint ensures that you avoid any potential conflicts or errors that might arise from attempting to send multiple commands simultaneously. \n\nFor example, if you intend to send a command to turn on the appliance, you would call this function and pass the specific value associated with the \"on\" command. Similarly, if you need to adjust a setting, such as temperature or speed, you would send a single value corresponding to the desired setting.\n\nParameters:\n- `command`: This parameter represents the single value that you send. It should be formatted according to the specifications required by the appliance, which may vary depending on the appliance's make and model.\n\nUsage Example:\nConsider a scenario where you want to change the volume level on a smart speaker. Here, you would call this function with the appropriate value that corresponds to the desired volume setting, ensuring that only this value is transmitted during the call.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["body"], "properties": {"body": {"type": "dict", "description": "A dictionary containing the parameters for the appliance command.", "properties": {"airConJobMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The current job mode of the air conditioner.", "enum": ["AIR_CLEAN", "COOL", "AIR_DRY"], "default": "COOL"}, "windStrength": {"type": "string", "description": "The strength of the air flow.", "enum": ["LOW", "HIGH", "MID"], "default": "MID"}, "monitoringEnabled": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether air quality sensor monitoring is enabled.", "default": false}, "airCleanOperationMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The operation mode for the air cleaning function.", "enum": ["START", "STOP"], "default": "STOP"}, "airConOperationMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The operation mode for the air conditioner, indicating if it is turned on or off.", "enum": ["POWER_ON", "POWER_OFF"], "default": "POWER_OFF"}, "powerSaveEnabled": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether power save mode is enabled to conserve energy.", "default": false}, "targetTemperature": {"type": "integer", "description": "The target temperature to set for the appliance, in degrees Celsius.", "default": 20}, "relativeHourToStop": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of hours from the current time when the appliance should stop.

The preprocessing step is a crucial part of the data preparation pipeline, as it ensures that the input data is in a suitable format for model training and prediction. \n\nNormalization is applied to the numerical values within the dataset. This process adjusts the scale of the numerical features so that they contribute equally to the model's learning process. By scaling these values, the function helps to eliminate potential biases that could arise from differences in the range or units of measurement among the features. Normalization typically involves transforming the data to a standard range, such as 0 to 1, or adjusting it to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.\n\nIn addition to normalization, this function handles categorical variables by encoding them into numerical representations. Categorical variables, which contain discrete values or categories, must be transformed into a numerical format for most machine learning algorithms to process them effectively. The function achieves this by applying techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding. One-hot encoding represents each category as a separate binary feature, while label encoding assigns an integer value to each category. By converting categorical variables in this manner, the function ensures that these features can be utilized effectively in the modeling process.\n\nThe combined effect of normalization and encoding prepares the dataset by maintaining the integrity and usefulness of data while ensuring that all variables are transformed in a way that is compatible with machine learning algorithms.

For strings, it returns the characters in reverse order. For booleans, it returns the negation. For numbers, it returns the negative value.This function is designed to reverse the given input by transforming it into an opposite or inverted form based on its data type. It handles different types of inputs, including strings, booleans, and numbers, each with their specific rules for reversal:\n\n- **Strings**: When the input is a string, this function processes it by reversing the order of its characters. For example, if the input string is \"hello\", the function will return \"olleh\". This reversal is achieved by iterating over the string from the end to the beginning, constructing a new string that starts with the last character of the input and ends with the first.\n\n- **Booleans**: In the case of a boolean input, the function returns its logical negation. Specifically, if the input is `true`, the function returns `false`, and if the input is `false`, the function returns `true`. This is accomplished using the logical NOT operation, which toggles the boolean state.\n\n- **Numbers**: For numerical inputs, the function returns the negative of the given number. For example, if the input is `5`, the function returns `-5`, and if the input is `-3`, it returns `3`. This inversion is performed by multiplying the number by `-1`, effectively changing its sign.\n\nEdge cases and considerations include ensuring that the input is of a recognized type (string, boolean, or number) before attempting to reverse it. If the input is of an unsupported type, the function may need to handle this scenario, potentially by throwing an error or returning a specific value indicating the unsupported type. Additionally, for integer inputs that are `0`, the function will return `0`, as the negative of zero is still zero. It is important to consider how the function should behave with complex numbers or other numerical types that might not clearly fall into the typical category of integers or floats.\n\nIn summary, this versatile function adapts its behavior according to the type of input provided,", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["input_value"], "properties": {"input_value": {"type": "any", "description": "The value to be reversed.

This function provides the capability to run commands directly in the Windows command shell (cmd.exe), thereby allowing interaction with the operating system's command-line interface from within a Python script.\n\nWhen utilizing this function, users can execute a single command to perform a specific task. For example, a simple command like \"dir\" can be executed to list the directory contents. Additionally, the function supports the execution of multiple commands in a single call by chaining them together using the logical 'AND' operator, denoted by '&&'.

These factors include the total distance the vehicle travels over the course of a year, the type of fuel that it uses, and its fuel efficiency rating.\n\n### Parameters:\n\n1. **Distance Traveled**: This parameter represents the total mileage or distance that the vehicle covers within a year. It is typically measured in miles or kilometers. The greater the distance traveled, the higher the likelihood of increased emissions, assuming all other factors are constant.\n\n2. **Fuel Type**: The type of fuel used by the vehicle is a crucial determinant of its CO2 emissions. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, and alternative fuels such as electric or hybrid options. Each fuel type has a different carbon content and emission factor, affecting the overall emissions calculation.\n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency**: Fuel efficiency is usually measured in terms of miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km). It indicates how effectively a vehicle uses fuel. Vehicles with higher fuel efficiency consume less fuel over the same distance, leading to lower carbon emissions.\n\n### Calculation Considerations:\n\n- **Emission Factors**: The function utilizes predefined emission factors that correspond to each fuel type. These factors represent the average CO2 emissions produced per unit of fuel consumed and are essential for accurate calculation.\n\n- **Conversion Metrics**: The function may require conversion between different measurement units, such as converting kilometers to miles or liters to gallons, depending on the input format.\n\n- **Annual Basis**: The calculation is specifically aimed at determining emissions on an annual basis. It assumes that the provided distance traveled is reflective of the vehicle's yearly usage.\n\n### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose a vehicle travels 15,000 kilometers annually, runs on gasoline, and has a fuel efficiency of 8 liters per 100 kilometers.

It takes a single argument, `query`, which represents the keywords that the user wants to use to find the desired song. These keywords could include the song title, artist name, album, or a combination of these elements.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- `query` (string): This is a required parameter that specifies the search criteria. The function expects a string input that may contain the name of the song, the artist, or any relevant keyword associated with the music track the user wishes to play. The more specific the query, the more accurate the search results will be.\n\n#### Functionality:\n1. **Search Mechanism:** The function initiates a search on the Spotify platform using the provided query. It sends a request to Spotify's search API to retrieve a list of songs that match the given criteria. The search is comprehensive and scans a wide database of music, covering various genres, artists, and albums.\n\n2. **Selection and Playback:** After retrieving the search results, the function selects the most relevant song based on the query. The criteria for selecting the best match could include exact title matches, the popularity of the song, or recency of release. Once the appropriate track is identified, the function sends a command to Spotify to play the song through the user's Spotify account.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- If the query is vague or too broad, the function may return multiple results, and the selection might not always be the user's intended choice.\n- In scenarios where no matches are found for the given query, the function should handle this gracefully, potentially by notifying the user of the issue or suggesting alternative queries.\n- The function assumes that the user is authenticated with Spotify and has an active session for playback to occur. If these conditions are not met, the function should handle authentication errors.\n\n#### Example Usage:\n```", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["query"], "properties": {"query": {"type": "string", "description": "The search query for the song.

The primary purpose of this function is to determine the difference in time zones between two places around the world, which could be important for scheduling meetings, coordinating travel plans, or simply understanding time-related aspects of different locations.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **location1**: The first parameter represents the first geographical location for which you want to know the time zone offset. This could be a city name, a country, or a specific coordinate (latitude and longitude). For instance, \"New York\" or \"40.7128\u00b0 N, 74.0060\u00b0 W\".\n\n- **location2**: The second parameter represents the second geographical location whose time zone offset will be compared against the first. This should be provided in a similar format as `location1`, such as \"Tokyo\" or \"35.6895\u00b0 N, 139.6917\u00b0 E\".\n\n#### Functionality:\n\nUpon receiving the input locations, the function identifies the respective time zones of each location. It then computes the difference in time between these two locations, taking into consideration factors such as the time of year, daylight saving changes, and any local time adjustments that might be in effect.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Daylight Saving Time (DST)**: The function takes into account any daylight saving adjustments that may be applicable to either of the locations during the specified period. This ensures accuracy across different times of the year when daylight saving policies might shift the local time by an hour.\n\n- **Non-standard Time Offsets**: Some regions have time zones that do not align with whole-hour differences (e.g., 30-minute or 45-minute offsets). This function correctly calculates these partial-hour differences as well.\n\n- **Destination Support**: If either location is a large city that spans multiple time zones (such as a country or large state), the function uses the most prominent", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"place1": {"type": "string", "description": "The first place for time difference."}, "place2": {"type": "string", "description": "The second place for time difference."}}, "required": ["place1", "place2"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"get_time_difference2": {"location1": "San Francisco", "location2": "Sydney"}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"get_time_difference2": {"location1": "San Francisco", "location2": "Sydney"}}], "possible_answer": [{"get_time_difference1": {"place1": ["San Francisco", "SF"], "place2": ["Sydney"]}}, {"get_time_difference2": {"place1": ["San Francisco", "SF"], "place2": ["Sydney"]}}, {"get_time_difference3": {"place1": ["San Francisco", "SF"], "place2": ["Sydney"]}}]}

To achieve this, the function takes two distinct parameters: `rank` and `suit`. The `rank` parameter represents the value of the card, which can vary from numbers such as 2 through 10 to face cards like Jack, Queen, King, and Ace. The second parameter, `suit`, indicates one of the four possible categories: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, or Spades. By providing these parameters, the function systematically searches through the deck to identify and locate the card that exactly matches both the specified rank and suit.\n\nThe function assumes that the input deck is a complete set of 52 playing cards, each uniquely defined by a combination of rank and suit. If the deck is structured as a list or array, the function would iterate over each card, comparing the rank and suit of each card in the deck to the provided parameters.
