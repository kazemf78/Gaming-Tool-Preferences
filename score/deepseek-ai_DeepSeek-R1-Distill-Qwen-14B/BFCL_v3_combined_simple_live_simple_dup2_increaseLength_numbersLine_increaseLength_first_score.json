The list is sorted in ascending order.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n- If the input number is a prime number itself, the function will return a list containing just that number, as a prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.\n- The smallest prime factor for any positive integer greater than 1 is 2. If the input is an even number, the function will first divide by 2 repeatedly until it becomes odd.\n- For negative numbers or non-integer input, the function should raise an exception or handle the error gracefully, as prime factorization is defined only for positive integers.\n\n#### Usage Example\n```python\n# Example 1: Prime factors of 28\n# 28 can be expressed as 2 * 2 * 7\nprime_factors(28)\n# Output: [2, 2, 7]\n\n# Example 2: Prime factors of a prime number like 13\nprime_factors(13)\n# Output: [13]\n\n# Example 3: Prime factors of 100\n# 100 can be expressed as 2 * 2 * 5 * 5\nprime_factors(100)\n# Output: [2, 2, 5, 5]\n```\n\n####", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"number": {"type": "integer", "description": "Number for which prime factors need to be calculated"}, "formatted": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Return formatted string if true, array if false.

The primary purpose of this function is to ensure that the food name inputted by the user adheres to a specific format requirement: it must be entirely in uppercase letters. This helps maintain consistency and potentially matches system constraints or database formats that require uppercase entries.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **foodName (string):** The name of the food item that the customer wishes to select or change to. This parameter is expected to be provided by the user or calling process. It is crucial that the provided food name is already converted to uppercase before being passed to this function, as this function does not handle the conversion but strictly enforces the uppercase format requirement.\n\n#### Behavior:\n- The function will check the provided `foodName` to ensure it is entirely in uppercase. If the name does not meet this requirement, the function might return an error or prompt for correction, depending on the system's error handling practices. \n- Assuming the `foodName` is correctly formatted, the function will proceed to update the current food selection to reflect the customer's request. This could involve updating a database record, altering an order list, or modifying an in-memory object that tracks current selections.\n- The function operates under the assumption that the input has been validated for existence and correctness beforehand, focusing solely on enforcing the uppercase format and updating the selection.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nTo use this function effectively, ensure the food name is in uppercase before calling the function. For instance, if a customer wants to change their selection to \"sushi,\" the input must be \"SUSHI\" instead, as shown below:\n\n```python\nchangeFoodSelection(\"SUSHI\")\n```\n\nThis example assumes the function `changeFoodSelection` is defined elsewhere in the codebase and can interact with other components like databases or order management systems to effect changes.

This adjustment process involves verifying that the name of the food item provided by the customer is formatted in uppercase letters, as this is a prerequisite for successful execution. The function ensures that the food name adheres to the uppercase requirement, which might be necessary for standardization, database consistency, or integration with other systems that are case-sensitive. \n\nFor instance, if a customer requests an item such as 'pasta', the input must be transformed or validated to 'PASTA' before the function processes the change. Edge cases to consider include scenarios where the customer input is already in uppercase, contains spaces, or where the food item is not listed in the available options. In these situations, the function should handle the input gracefully, maintaining system stability and providing appropriate feedback or error messages if needed.\n\nUsage of this function might involve checking whether the customer\u2019s requested food item is available and subsequently updating the selection while respecting the uppercase condition. Here is an example of how the function could be employed:\n\n```python\ndef change_food_selection(requested_food):\n    # Convert requested food to uppercase\n    formatted_food = requested_food.upper()\n    \n    # Check if the formatted food is available in the menu\n    if formatted_food in available_menu:\n        # Proceed to change the selection\n        update_selection(formatted_food)\n    else:\n        # Handle case where the food item is not available\n        print(\"Requested food item is not available.\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the `requested_food` parameter is the customer's input, which is converted to uppercase using the `upper()` method. The function then checks if the formatted food name exists in the `available_menu` list or database. If available, it updates the selection accordingly; otherwise, it provides a message indicating the unavailability of the item.

This calculation is rooted in the principles of classical mechanics, specifically the kinematic equations that describe motion.\n\nTo determine the final velocity, the function uses the kinematic equation:\n\n\\[ v_f = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot a \\cdot d} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( v_f \\) represents the final velocity of the object,\n- \\( a \\) is the constant acceleration of the object, and\n- \\( d \\) is the distance over which the object has traveled.\n\nThe equation assumes that the initial velocity (\\( v_i \\)) is zero, which simplifies the standard kinematic formula:\n\n\\[ v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2 \\cdot a \\cdot d \\]\n\nIn scenarios where the initial velocity is zero, this equation reduces to the one provided above.\n\n**Edge Cases and Assumptions:**\n- **Zero or Negative Acceleration:** If the acceleration is zero, the final velocity remains zero since the object does not speed up.

An isothermal process is characterized by maintaining a constant temperature throughout the process, meaning that any heat exchange with the surroundings does not result in a change in temperature of the system. A reversible process is an idealized or hypothetical process that occurs in such a way that the system and its surroundings can be returned to their initial states by exactly reversing the process without any increase in entropy.\n\nIn thermodynamics, entropy is a measure of the amount of energy in a physical system that is not available to do work, often associated with the degree of disorder or randomness in the system. The change in entropy, denoted as \u0394S, during a reversible process can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\u0394S = Q_rev / T,\n\nwhere Q_rev is the amount of reversible heat exchange (in joules) and T is the absolute temperature (in Kelvin) at which the process occurs. Since the process is isothermal, the temperature remains constant, simplifying the calculation of entropy change.\n\nThis function is particularly useful in theoretical physics and engineering contexts where understanding the flow of energy and the efficiency of processes is crucial. It is important to note that this calculation assumes ideal conditions and may not accurately predict entropy changes in real-world, irreversible processes due to additional factors like friction, turbulence, or non-ideal material behavior.\n\nExample Usage:\n- To calculate the entropy change for a gas expanding reversibly and isothermally when it absorbs 1000 J of heat at a constant temperature of 300 K, you can use the formula as follows: \u0394S = 1000 / 300 = 3.33 J/K.

Additionally, if the list contains elements of different types that cannot be directly compared, the function will raise an error, alerting the user to ensure that all elements are of a comparable type.\n\nHere is an example of how the function might be used:\n\n```python\n# Example usage of the sorting function\n\n# Sorting a list of integers in ascending order\nsorted_list_asc = sort_function([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6])\n\n# Sorting a list of strings in descending order\nsorted_list_desc = sort_function(['apple', 'orange', 'banana'], False)\n```\n\nIn the first example, the function receives a list of integers and returns a new list where the integers are ordered from smallest to largest. In the second example, the list of strings is sorted in reverse alphabetical order due to the `False` parameter passed to the", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"list": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "float"}, "description": "The list of numbers to be sorted."}, "order": {"type": "string", "enum": ["ascending", "descending"], "description": "Order of sorting."}}, "required": ["list", "order"]}}, {"name": "array_sort2", "description": "Sorts a given list in ascending or descending order.

It acts as a filter to narrow down the restaurant list to those that serve the desired type of food. For instance, this could be \"Italian,\" \"Japanese,\" \"Mexican,\" etc.\n\n2. **Location**: This parameter defines the geographical area where the search for the highest rated restaurant should be conducted. It could be a city, a neighborhood, or a specific area code, allowing the function to limit its search to a manageable and relevant scope.\n\n3. **Condition**: This could represent any additional requirement or preference that the user wants the restaurant to meet. This condition could be related to price range, dietary options, ambiance, or any other factor that could influence the decision. The function uses this condition to further refine the list of qualified restaurants.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\n- The function first filters the restaurants based on the specified cuisine, ensuring that only those that serve the desired type of food are considered.\n- Next, it narrows down this list to include only those restaurants that are located within the given geographical area, as defined by the location parameter.\n- It then applies any extra condition provided by the user, further filtering the restaurants to meet this specific requirement.\n- Among the remaining restaurants, the function evaluates their ratings, which could be based on customer reviews or a rating system.\n- Finally, it retrieves and returns the restaurant with the highest rating from this refined list.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n-", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"cuisine": {"type": "string", "description": "Cuisine of the restaurant."}, "location": {"type": "string", "description": "City where restaurant is located."}, "condition": {"type": "string", "description": "Condition to be met by the restaurant (e.g., operating days, amenities, etc.)"}}, "required": ["cuisine", "location", "condition"]}}, {"name": "get_restaurant2", "description": "Retrieve highest rated restaurant given cuisine, location, and a condition.

The function plays a crucial role in maintaining an organized system of query classifications, which can be instrumental for further processing, reporting, and fulfilling banking operational requirements.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **query_id**: A unique identifier for each query that is to be recorded. This ensures that each query can be distinctly recognized and tracked.\n- **query_content**: The actual content or body of the query. This is the text or message that describes the banking-related issue or request.\n- **category**: A predefined list or system of categories under which the query will be classified. Categories might include loan inquiries, transaction disputes, account management, fraud alerts, etc.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- The function should handle scenarios where a query does not clearly fit into any defined category, potentially by assigning it to a default or miscellaneous category or flagging it for manual review.\n- It must also address queries that could belong to multiple categories by applying predefined rules for prioritization or categorization to ensure consistency.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nTo illustrate the function's application, consider a scenario where a customer submits a query about a potential credit card fraud. The function would:\n- Receive the unique query_id to track this particular correspondence.\n- Extract and analyze the query_content to determine the nature of the issue.\n- Classify this query under the 'Fraud Alerts' category based on the content analysis.\n\nBy recording the categories of banking-related queries, this function enhances the efficiency of customer service operations, supports data-driven insights, and contributes to improved service delivery in the banking sector.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["faq_describe_telephone_banking_start", "bank_hours_start", "faq_describe_accounts_start"], "properties": {"faq_describe_telephone_banking_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "An array of strings containing queries about starting or signing up for telephone banking services."}, "bank_hours_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "An array of strings containing queries regarding the working hours or locations of bank branches."}, "faq_describe_accounts_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "An array of strings containing queries about descriptions of different types of bank accounts."}}}}, {"name": "record2", "description": "Records the categories to which various banking-related queries are classified.

Each parameter represents a different intent and accepts a list of query strings that should be classified under that intent.This function serves the purpose of recording classifications for a batch of queries by organizing them according to specified intents. Each intent is represented as a parameter, and for every intent, the function accepts a list of query strings that are to be classified under that particular intent category. This allows for systematic categorization of queries based on their relevance to certain pre-defined intents.\n\nThe function can handle multiple intents at once, with each intent being a distinct parameter. For example, if the function is designed to classify queries into intents such as \"purchase\", \"support\", and \"feedback\", you would pass a list of queries that correspond to each of these intents. The purchase intent would have its own list, as would the support and feedback intents. Each list consists of query strings that users might input, and these strings are grouped based on the intent they are most closely associated with.\n\nAn edge case to consider is when a query string does not fit neatly into any of the provided intent categories. In such a scenario, the function's behavior will depend on its implementation details, which could include options such as discarding the query, logging it for manual review, or assigning it to a default or miscellaneous intent category. Additionally, handling empty lists or null inputs for any of the intents should also be considered, as this might affect the function's output or lead to exceptions depending on its implementation.\n\nTo illustrate usage:\n- Suppose you have intents labeled as \"purchase\" and \"information\". You would call the function with two parameters, each containing a list of query strings. For instance:\n  - Intent \"purchase\" could include queries like [\"buy shoes\", \"order iPhone\"].\n  - Intent \"information\" might consist of queries such as [\"store hours\", \"return policy\"].\n\nThis function thus enables efficient sorting and handling of user queries by categorizing them into specific intents, facilitating better query management and response strategies.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": [], "properties": {"acc_routing_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries requesting bank routing numbers or account numbers.", "default": []}, "atm_finder_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries asking for ATM locations or to urgently find an ATM for cash withdrawal.", "default": []}, "faq_link_accounts_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries related to linking accounts within the bank's system.", "default": []}, "get_balance_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries requesting account balances, available funds, or other financial balances.", "default": []}, "get_transactions_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries related to viewing transaction details including deposits and purchases.", "default": []}, "outofscope": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries that do not classify under any of the other available intents.", "default": []}}}}, {"name": "record2", "description": "Records classifications for a batch of queries based on specified intents.

This statistical measure is used to assess the goodness of fit of the model by indicating the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). The R-squared value ranges from 0 to 1, where a value closer to 1 suggests that a large proportion of the variance is accounted for by the model, indicating a better fit, while a value closer to 0 suggests that the model fails to explain much of the variance, indicating a poorer fit.\n\nWhen calculating the coefficient of determination, the function typically requires the actual and predicted values of the dependent variable. The function will compute the total sum of squares (TSS), which measures the total variance in the actual data, and the residual sum of squares (RSS), which measures the variance not explained by the model. The R-squared value is then calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ R^2 = 1 - \\frac{RSS}{TSS} \\]\n\nAn edge case to consider is when the variance in the dependent variable is zero (i.e., all observed values are identical). In such cases, the TSS would be zero, potentially leading to a division by zero error when calculating R-squared. Therefore, the function should handle this scenario, possibly by defining R-squared as 1 when the variance is zero, since the model perfectly explains the constant observed values.\n\nUsage example:\nAssume you have a set of observed values and corresponding predicted values from a regression model, and you need to calculate the R-squared value to determine how well the model fits the data.

This function is particularly tailored for scenarios where you need to run shell commands directly from a Python script. \n\nWhen using this function to execute multiple commands in sequence, you should separate each command with the '&&' operator.

This operation requires the provision of the user's unique identifier, commonly referred to as the user ID, which is an essential parameter for the function to execute successfully. The user ID uniquely identifies the specific user within the system whose mandates are to be fetched. \n\nIn addition to the user ID, the function accepts an optional parameter, known as the status. This parameter allows the caller to specify a particular status, facilitating the filtering of mandates based on their current state.

It begins by taking a complete deck consisting of the four traditional suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades, each containing thirteen cards ranging from Ace through King. The deck, therefore, contains 52 unique cards in total.\n\nThe primary operation performed by this function is shuffling, which randomizes the order of the cards within the deck to ensure a fair draw. This step is crucial for any applications where unpredictability and randomness are desired, such as in card games or simulations.\n\nOnce the deck is sufficiently shuffled, the function proceeds to draw cards. The number of cards to be drawn is specified as an input parameter. For example, if the parameter value is set to 5, the function will draw the top five cards from the shuffled deck. This parameter allows flexibility in usage, accommodating varying requirements for different card games or experiments. \n\nIt's important to note that the function assumes the number of cards requested does not exceed the total number of cards in the deck. If a value larger than 52 is provided, it may result in an error or require additional handling to manage such cases appropriately. The drawn cards are typically returned in the order they were drawn, maintaining the sequence as they appeared from the top of the shuffled deck.\n\nIn terms of usage, this function can be particularly useful in gaming applications where a deck needs to be shuffled and a specific number of cards dealt to players. It can also be employed in simulations or educational tools that require random card selection from a deck.

Options to include specific departments are available.### Function Description: Locate Nearby Hospitals\n\nThis function is designed to help users find nearby hospitals based on their current location and a specified search radius. By leveraging geolocation data, the function identifies hospitals within the defined area, providing a list of potential healthcare facilities.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **Location:** The geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) representing the user's current position. This information is crucial for calculating the proximity of hospitals in the vicinity.\n- **Radius:** The search radius, typically measured in kilometers or miles, which defines the maximum distance from the specified location within which hospitals should be found. The radius allows users to control the scope of their search, making it as broad or as narrow as needed.\n- **Departments (optional):** Users can specify particular medical departments or specialties they are interested in, such as cardiology, pediatrics, or emergency services. Including department preferences helps refine the search results to only those hospitals that offer the desired services.\n\n#### Functionality:\nUpon execution, the function processes the given location and radius to query a database of healthcare facilities. It then returns a list of hospitals located within the defined radius. If department options are provided, the list is further filtered to include only those hospitals with the specified departments, ensuring that users receive tailored results that meet their specific medical needs.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nSuppose a user is located at geographic coordinates (40.7128, -74.0060) and wishes to find hospitals within a 10-mile radius. If they are particularly interested in hospitals with neurology departments, these parameters can be set accordingly. The function will output a list of hospitals within 10 miles of the specified location that have neurology services available.\n\nThis function is particularly useful for individuals seeking immediate medical assistance or looking to locate facilities that offer specific treatments or services in their area.
