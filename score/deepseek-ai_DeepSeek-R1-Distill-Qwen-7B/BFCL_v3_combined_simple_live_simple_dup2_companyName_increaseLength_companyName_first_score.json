This formula derives from the geometric principle that the area of a triangle is half the product of its base length and its corresponding height. The base of the triangle refers to any one of its sides, and the height is the perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite vertex. \n\nParameters:\n- **Base**: This parameter represents the length of the base side of the triangle. It must be a positive numerical value, typically measured in units such as meters, feet, or any other standard length measurement unit.\n- **Height**: This parameter denotes the height of the triangle, defined as the perpendicular line segment from the base to the vertex opposite the base. Like the base, it should also be a positive numerical value and ideally measured in the same units as the base to ensure correct area calculation.\n\nThe function will multiply the base by the height and then divide the result by 2 to obtain the area.

This process is crucial in various fields such as physics, engineering, and economics, where understanding how a function behaves locally is essential for analysis and decision-making.\n\nIn mathematical terms, the derivative of a function at a specific value is the slope of the tangent line to the function's graph at that particular point. This slope represents the rate at which the function's value changes with respect to changes in the input variable, providing insight into the function's behavior and trends near the given value.\n\nTo compute the derivative at a specific value, the function typically requires two primary inputs: the function itself, which can be expressed in terms of a mathematical expression or an algorithmic form, and the specific value of the input variable at which the derivative is to be calculated. Depending on the method employed, additional parameters might be needed, such as the differentiation method (symbolic or numerical) or precision settings for numerical differentiation.\n\nWhen performing symbolic differentiation, the derivative is computed by analytically manipulating the function's expression, following rules of calculus, to obtain a new function representing the derivative. This new function is then evaluated at the desired specific value.\n\nAlternatively, numerical differentiation involves approximating the derivative using numerical methods, such as the finite difference method. This approach is particularly useful when the function is not easily expressed symbolically or when working with data points. In this case, the derivative is estimated by calculating the ratio of changes in the function's output to small changes in the input variable near the specific value.\n\nConsiderations to keep in mind include the potential for numerical instability or inaccuracies in the presence of round-off errors when using numerical methods.

When a user inputs a number into this function, the function calculates and returns a list of prime numbers that, when multiplied together, result in the original number. This is a critical operation in various areas of mathematics and computer science, such as cryptography, number theory, and algorithm design.\n\nThe function works by iterating through possible divisors, starting from the smallest prime number, which is 2.

It performs an essential task by ensuring that the name of the food item, as provided in the customer's request, is altered to comply with a particular format requirement \u2014 being in uppercase letters. This functionality is crucial for maintaining uniformity and meeting system standards that dictate the use of uppercase for all food item entries.\n\n#### Functionality Details:\n- **Input:** The function takes in a food item name as part of the customer's order or request. It is expected that this name is provided as a string.\n- **Processing:** Upon receiving the input, the function processes the string to check and convert the food name to uppercase. This step ensures that regardless of how the food name is initially input (whether in lowercase, mixed case, etc.), it will be stored or returned in an uppercase format.\n- **Output:** The function outputs the modified food name, ensuring it is in uppercase, thus guaranteeing consistency across all food selections within the system.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- If the input food name is already in uppercase, the function will recognize this and maintain the current format without unnecessary modifications.\n- The function should handle cases where the input might be an empty string by appropriately managing such instances to prevent errors or unexpected behavior.\n- Non-string inputs should be checked and managed, either by converting them to strings if possible or raising an error to notify that the input is invalid.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nSuppose a customer requests \"pasta\" as their food choice. When this function is applied, the output will be \"PASTA,\" ensuring that the system records the food selection in the required uppercase format.\n\n```python\nchange_food_selection(\"pasta\")  # Output: \"PASTA\"\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates the function's role in transforming the input string to meet the uppercase requirement, highlighting how it achieves both data consistency and system compliance.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["TheFod"], "properties": {"TheFod": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the food to be changed, provided in uppercase letters only (e.g., 'PIZZA', 'BURGER').", "enum": ["PIZZA", "BURGER", "SALAD", "SOUP", "STEAK"]}}}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\nI need to provide a response, but since none of the functions can be used for this request, I will inform the user accordingly.\n\nNone of the functions can be used because the requested food \"Whopper\" is not an allowed option in the provided enum.", "possible_answer": [{"ChaFod1": {"TheFod": ["BURGER"]}}, {"ChaFod2": {"TheFod": ["BURGER"]}}, {"ChaFod3": {"TheFod": ["BURGER"]}}]}

A key requirement for this function is that it must ensure the name of the food item is presented in uppercase letters. This requirement is crucial for maintaining consistency, possibly due to system constraints or display standards that necessitate uniform formatting of food names.\n\nWhen the function is executed, it takes the customer's desired food selection as input and processes it to verify and transform the name into uppercase form. This step is essential to ensure that the entry complies with the predefined format standards that might be used throughout the system for data storage, retrieval, or display purposes.\n\nEdge cases that the function might handle include scenarios where the input food name is already in uppercase, which should be retained as is, or where the input is in mixed or lowercase, necessitating conversion to uppercase. Additionally, if the input is not a valid food name or does not exist in the list of available options, the function should ideally handle such exceptions gracefully, perhaps by notifying the user of the invalid entry or requesting a new input.\n\nFor example, if the customer requests a food item called \"pizza,\" the function would process this request by converting \"pizza\" to \"PIZZA\" before changing the selection. Conversely, if the input is already \"PIZZA,\" no transformation is needed, and the selection is updated directly.\n\nIn summary, this function plays a critical role in standardizing food selections by ensuring that all names are in uppercase, thus aligning with system requirements or user interface design principles.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["TheFod"], "properties": {"TheFod": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the food to be changed, provided in uppercase letters only (e.g., 'PIZZA', 'BURGER').", "enum": ["PIZZA", "BURGER", "SALAD", "SOUP", "STEAK"]}}}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\nChaFod2({'TheFod': 'PIZZA'})", "model_result_decoded": [{"ChaFod2": {}}], "possible_answer": [{"ChaFod1": {"TheFod": ["PIZZA"]}}, {"ChaFod2": {"TheFod": ["PIZZA"]}}, {"ChaFod3": {"TheFod": ["PIZZA"]}}]}

This calculation assumes the absence of air resistance, meaning the object falls in a vacuum where the only force acting on it is gravity. \n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is a constant and is set as -9.81 meters per second squared (m/s\u00b2).

Therefore, the empty string serves as a signal that an answer could not be derived from the given input.\n\nTo clarify its functionality, consider the following example: if the input string contains expressions such as \"unknown,\" \"no answer,\" or any other indication of uncertainty or lack of information, the function will determine that a meaningful answer cannot be extracted from the input. As a result, it will produce an empty string, signifying the absence of a valid answer.\n\nThe function is particularly useful in scenarios where parsing input to derive clear answers is critical, such as in automated question-answering systems or dialogue interfaces.

Entropy, a measure of disorder or randomness in a system, is a fundamental concept in thermodynamics, particularly in understanding energy distribution and efficiency.\n\n### Parameters\n\n- **initial_temperature (T)**: This parameter represents the constant temperature at which the process occurs. It is crucial that this temperature remains constant throughout the process to ensure it is isothermal. The temperature is generally expressed in Kelvin (K) to maintain consistency with thermodynamic calculations.\n\n- **heat_transfer (Q)**: The heat transferred into or out of the system during the process. For a reversible process, this transfer must occur in such a way that the system remains in equilibrium with its surroundings at every stage. The heat transfer is typically measured in joules (J).\n\n### Calculation Details\n\nThe entropy change for an isothermal and reversible process is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta S = \\frac{Q}{T}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\Delta S \\) is the change in entropy.\n- \\( Q \\) is the heat transferred.\n- \\( T \\) is the constant absolute temperature at which the process occurs.\n\n### Edge Cases and Considerations\n\n- **Zero Heat Transfer**: If the heat transfer (\\( Q \\)) is zero, the change in entropy (\\( \\Delta S \\)) will also be zero. This occurs when no energy enters or leaves the system as heat, which could be a hypothetical scenario in a perfectly isolated system.\n\n- **Negative Heat Transfer**: In cases where heat is removed from the system (\\( Q \\) is negative), the entropy change will also be negative, indicating a decrease in the system's disorder as it loses energy.\n\n- **Temperature Constraints**: The function assumes that the input temperature (\\( T \\)) is", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"initial_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial temperature in Kelvin."}, "final_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The final temperature in Kelvin."}, "heat_capacity": {"type": "integer", "description": "The heat capacity in J/K."}, "isothermal": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether the process is isothermal.

For example, the formula for water is H2O, and that for glucose is C6H12O6.\n\n#### Functionality:\n- The function parses the input string `compound_formula` to identify each element and its corresponding subscript.\n- It retrieves the atomic weight of each element from a pre-defined database or periodic table, which contains the standard atomic weights of elements.\n- It multiplies the atomic weight of each element by the number of times it occurs (as indicated by the subscript in the formula) to determine the total weight contributed by that element.\n- It sums the weights contributed by all elements to calculate the total molecular weight of the compound.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- The function assumes that the input formula is correctly formatted according to chemical conventions.\n- It should handle simple compounds with single elements as well as complex organic compounds.\n- The function should be robust against common formatting errors, such as missing subscripts, by assuming a subscript of 1 if no number is specified.\n- The function should also handle cases of isotopes if the atomic weights are specified as averages and are included in the database.\n\n#### Example Usage:\n- For a simple compound like water (H2O), the function will identify two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Given hydrogen's atomic weight of approximately 1.008 and oxygen's atomic", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"compound": {"type": "string", "description": "The molecular formula of the compound."}, "to_unit": {"type": "string", "description": "The unit in which to return the result."}}, "required": ["compound", "to_unit"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\n[calculate_molecular_weight1(compound=\"C6H12O6\", to_unit=\"grams/mole\"), calculate_molecular_weight1]", "possible_answer": [{"calculate_molecular_weight1": {"compound": ["C6H12O6"], "to_unit": ["grams/mole", "g/mol"]}}, {"calculate_molecular_weight2": {"compound": ["C6H12O6"], "to_unit": ["grams/mole", "g/mol"]}}, {"calculate_molecular_weight3": {"compound": ["C6H12O6"], "to_unit": ["grams/mole", "g/mol"]}}]}

By utilizing various data points related to forest dynamics\u2014such as tree density, species diversity, growth rates, and environmental factors\u2014the function offers an estimation of how the forest will expand or change over the given time period.\n\n### Parameters\n\n- **N (integer):** This parameter represents the number of years into the future for which the forest growth prediction is to be calculated. It must be a positive integer, as the function cannot predict growth for negative time intervals or non-integer values. The choice of N can affect the accuracy of the prediction, with longer time spans potentially introducing more uncertainty due to unforeseen environmental changes or human impact.\n\n### Usage\n\nTo utilize this function effectively, the user must first ensure that they have accurate and up-to-date data representing the current state of the forest. This data should include metrics such as the current growth rate of trees, species composition, and any relevant environmental conditions such as average annual rainfall and temperature fluctuations. Once this data is in place, the function can be called with N as its argument to project future growth trends.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\nWhile the function robustly models growth based on existing trends, users should be aware of potential edge cases. These include situations where external factors\u2014such as natural disasters, significant changes in climate, or human interventions like deforestation or afforestation\u2014might drastically alter growth patterns. In such cases, predictions might be less reliable, and users should interpret results with caution.\n\n### Example\n\nConsider a scenario where a forest currently exhibits an average annual growth rate of 3%. If a user desires to predict the forest's growth over the next 10 years, they would call the function with N set to 10. The function will then process this input alongside the current growth data to produce an estimated size and composition of the forest", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"location": {"type": "string", "description": "The location where you want to predict forest growth."}, "years": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of years for the forecast."}, "include_human_impact": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether or not to include the impact of human activities in the forecast.

The function utilizes a sorting algorithm to compare the integers within the array and reorder them from the lowest to the highest value. \n\nThis sorting process may involve several comparisons and rearrangements of the elements, depending on the initial order of the array. If the array is already sorted, the function will recognize this condition and complete the operation with minimal processing. Conversely, if the array is initially in descending order or randomly arranged, the function will execute more comparisons and swaps to achieve the desired ascending order.\n\nIn edge cases, such as when the array is empty, the function will handle this gracefully by recognizing that there are no elements to sort, and it will return the empty array as-is without performing any operations. Similarly, if the array contains only one integer, the function will determine that no sorting is necessary, as a single element is inherently sorted.\n\nUsage Example:\nConsider an array `arr` defined as `[5, 3, 8, 1, 2]`.

By default, the function sorts the list in ascending order, meaning from the lowest value to the highest. However, an additional optional parameter allows the user to specify descending order if desired. In descending order, the elements will be sorted from the highest value to the lowest.

It prepares data for machine learning models, ensuring numerical values are scaled properly and categorical variables are appropriately transformed.This function is designed to preprocess input data in preparation for machine learning models by applying a series of transformations, specifically normalization and encoding of categorical variables. The preprocessing step is a crucial part of the data preparation pipeline, as it ensures that the input data is in a suitable format for model training and prediction. \n\nNormalization is applied to the numerical values within the dataset. This process adjusts the scale of the numerical features so that they contribute equally to the model's learning process. By scaling these values, the function helps to eliminate potential biases that could arise from differences in the range or units of measurement among the features. Normalization typically involves transforming the data to a standard range, such as 0 to 1, or adjusting it to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.\n\nIn addition to normalization, this function handles categorical variables by encoding them into numerical representations. Categorical variables, which contain discrete values or categories, must be transformed into a numerical format for most machine learning algorithms to process them effectively. The function achieves this by applying techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding. One-hot encoding represents each category as a separate binary feature, while label encoding assigns an integer value to each category. By converting categorical variables in this manner, the function ensures that these features can be utilized effectively in the modeling process.\n\nThe combined effect of normalization and encoding prepares the dataset by maintaining the integrity and usefulness of data while ensuring that all variables are transformed in a way that is compatible with machine learning algorithms. This ensures that numerical values are properly scaled, preventing any feature from disproportionately influencing the model, and categorical variables are transformed into a numerical form that models can interpret and leverage during analysis.\n\nIn practice, the function can be used as part of a data preprocessing pipeline, where it systematically processes datasets before they are fed into machine learning models.

The function internally retrieves the correct sales tax rate for the given jurisdiction, ensuring that the calculation aligns with local tax laws and regulations.\n\nOnce the correct tax rate is applied to the purchase amount, the function calculates the sales tax by multiplying the purchase amount by the jurisdiction's tax rate. It then adds this calculated tax to the original purchase amount to determine the total amount due, inclusive of tax. This total, which includes both the original purchase amount and the calculated sales tax, is returned as the final output of the function.\n\nEdge cases handled by the function may include scenarios where the jurisdiction does not have a sales tax or when the purchase amount is zero, in which cases the function will simply return the original purchase amount. The function also accounts for jurisdictions that might have varying tax rates for different types of goods or services, ensuring accurate computation. \n\nExample usage of this function might include a call where a user specifies a purchase amount of $100 and a jurisdiction identified as \"New York City.\" The function would then apply the appropriate tax rate for New York City to the $100 purchase amount and return the total amount including tax.

It handles different types of inputs, including strings, booleans, and numbers, each with their specific rules for reversal:\n\n- **Strings**: When the input is a string, this function processes it by reversing the order of its characters. For example, if the input string is \"hello\", the function will return \"olleh\". This reversal is achieved by iterating over the string from the end to the beginning, constructing a new string that starts with the last character of the input and ends with the first.\n\n- **Booleans**: In the case of a boolean input, the function returns its logical negation. Specifically, if the input is `true`, the function returns `false`, and if the input is `false`, the function returns `true`. This is accomplished using the logical NOT operation, which toggles the boolean state.\n\n- **Numbers**: For numerical inputs, the function returns the negative of the given number. For example, if the input is `5`, the function returns `-5`, and if the input is `-3`, it returns `3`. This inversion is performed by multiplying the number by `-1`, effectively changing its sign.\n\nEdge cases and considerations include ensuring that the input is of a recognized type (string, boolean, or number) before attempting to reverse it.

This test is applicable when comparing two groups to ascertain if they originate from the same population or if their observed differences are likely due to random variation. \n\nThe t-test assumes that the datasets are normally distributed and have equal variances, which is termed the assumption of homoscedasticity. It is pertinent to check these assumptions before applying the t-test, as violations can affect the accuracy of the results. The datasets should be independent, meaning the observations in one dataset are not related to those in the other dataset.\n\nWhen conducting the t-test, the null hypothesis posits that there is no difference between the means of the two datasets. The alternative hypothesis suggests that a significant difference exists. The result of the t-test is a t-statistic and a p-value. The t-statistic measures the size of the difference relative to the variation in the sample data, while the p-value helps determine the significance of the results. A low p-value (typically \u2264 0.05) indicates that the observed data would be unlikely under the null hypothesis, leading to its rejection in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\n\nEdge cases may include situations where the datasets contain outliers or are not normally distributed. In such cases, a non-parametric test may be warranted to achieve more reliable results. Additionally, if the datasets have different variances, a variation of the t-test known as Welch's t-test might be more appropriate.\n\nFor example, if you have two datasets, Dataset A and Dataset B, each containing independent samples of test scores from two different groups of students, the t-test can determine if the average test scores of the two groups are statistically different.

The coefficient of determination is a statistical measure that is used to assess the goodness of fit of the model, indicating how well the observed outcomes are replicated by the model given the input data. R\u00b2 values range from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 implies that the regression model perfectly predicts the dependent variable, and a value of 0 indicates that the model does not predict the dependent variable at all.\n\nThis function typically requires two key inputs: the actual observed values and the predicted values produced by the regression model. The actual values represent the true data points for the dependent variable, while the predicted values are the estimates generated by the model based on the independent variables.\n\nThe function works by comparing the variance of the residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values) to the variance of the observed data. It calculates the total sum of squares (TSS), which represents the total variance in the observed data, and the residual sum of squares (RSS), which measures the variance explained by the model's errors. R\u00b2 is then computed as:\n\nR\u00b2 = 1 - (RSS / TSS)\n\nThis formula provides the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. In practical terms, a higher R\u00b2 value generally indicates a better fit of the model to the data, suggesting that a larger proportion of the variance in the dependent variable is captured by the model. However, it is important to note that a high R\u00b2 does not necessarily imply that the model is appropriate or free from bias, and other statistical measures should also be considered when evaluating the performance of a regression model.\n\nUsage Example:\nSuppose you have a dataset containing actual sales figures and corresponding predicted sales figures from a regression model.

For example, a simple command like \"dir\" can be executed to list the directory contents. Additionally, the function supports the execution of multiple commands in a single call by chaining them together using the logical 'AND' operator, denoted by '&&'. This means that several commands can be linked in sequence, where each subsequent command will only execute if the previous command completes successfully. For instance, you could chain commands like \"cd C:\\ && dir\" to change directories and then list the contents of the directory, all within a single invocation of the function.\n\nIt is worth noting that the use of '&&' ensures that the subsequent command only runs if the preceding command returns a successful exit status, which is typically zero in the context of most command-line commands on Windows. This feature is particularly useful for scripting and automation tasks where conditional execution of commands is required.\n\nThe os.system() function call will return a status code upon completion, with '0' indicating successful execution and a non-zero value indicating an error or issue during execution. This return value can be used for error handling and to make decisions based on the success or failure of the command execution.\n\nHere is an example usage of this function:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Execute a single command\nos.system(\"dir\")  # Lists directory contents\n\n# Execute multiple commands chained with '&&'\nos.system(\"cd C:\\\\ && dir\")  # Changes directory to C: and then lists contents\n```\n\nBy understanding these nuances, users can effectively employ this function to automate and control system operations seamlessly from within", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.### Function Description\n\nThis function is designed to execute system-level commands specifically on Windows operating systems. It utilizes the `os.system()` method, which is a built-in function in Python's `os` module, to carry out the command execution. The primary purpose of this function is to allow users to interact with the underlying Windows operating system by sending commands that can be executed in the command shell.\n\n#### Functionality\n\n- **Command Execution**: The function can execute both individual commands and a series of commands. In the case of multiple commands, these can be chained together using the logical 'AND' operator `&&`. This means that each command will be executed sequentially, and the execution of subsequent commands will only occur if the previous command completes successfully without errors.\n  \n- **Windows OS Specific**: It is important to note that this function is tailored for use on Windows operating systems. While `os.system()` is available on other operating systems, the behavior and shell syntax may vary. Thus, this function is specifically optimized and intended for Windows environments.\n\n- **Return Value**: The `os.system()` function returns an exit status code of the command being executed. On Windows, a return value of `0` typically indicates that the command was executed successfully without errors. Any non-zero value usually signifies that an error occurred during the execution of the command.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n\n- **Command Syntax**: If there is a syntactical error in the command string, or if the command is not recognized by the Windows command shell, the execution will fail, and an error code will be returned. It is crucial for the user to ensure that the command string is correctly formatted and valid.\n\n- **Environment and Permissions**: The success of the command execution may depend on the environment in which the function is run. Certain commands might require administrative privileges. If such privileges are not granted, the command might fail, returning an error code.\n\n#### Example Usage\n\n- **Single Command Execution**: To run", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

The primary purpose of this function is to facilitate the execution of command-line instructions directly from within a Python script.\n\nThe `os.system()` function is capable of executing both single and multiple commands. When multiple commands need to be executed, they can be chained together using the '&&' operator, which allows for sequential execution. In this context, '&&' ensures that each command is executed only if the preceding command is successful, i.e., it returns a zero exit status. \n\nThis feature is particularly useful for automating tasks that require a series of commands to be executed in a specific order, where the success of later commands depends on the success of earlier ones. For example, you might want to compile a program and then run it only if the compilation step succeeds. The function handles all such scenarios smoothly, provided the commands are syntactically correct and appropriate for the Windows command line.\n\nHere is a simple usage example:\n```python\nimport os\n\n# This will first compile a program and then execute it, only if compilation succeeds.\nos.system(\"gcc my_program.c -o my_program && my_program\")\n```\nIn this example, if the compilation of `my_program.c` is successful, the compiled program `my_program` will be executed. If there is an error in compilation, the execution will not proceed to running the program.\n\nIt is important to note that using `os.system()` is generally considered less secure than other methods, as it can be susceptible to command injection if not managed carefully. Therefore, it is recommended to validate any user input that might be passed to this function.\n\nOverall, this function provides a straightforward interface for integrating command-line operations into Python applications on Windows, leveraging the power of the command line directly within scripts.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

This functionality is highly useful for automating command-line tasks or integrating system commands into Python scripts.\n\nThe function can handle not only individual commands but also multiple commands that are chained together using the '&&' operator. This chaining mechanism is particularly advantageous when you need to execute multiple commands in sequence and want subsequent commands to run only if the preceding ones succeed.

It takes into account several critical inputs to ensure the contract is suited to the needs of the involved parties. The function requires the user to specify the parties involved in the contract, the type of contract being generated, and the location where the contract will be applied. These inputs are crucial as they directly influence the legal language, clauses, and applicability of the contract.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **Involved Parties**: \n   - This parameter should include detailed information about all parties engaged in the contract. This includes names, roles, and possibly other identifying details necessary to clearly distinguish each party within the legal framework of the contract.\n   - Edge Case: If the number of parties exceeds standard limits or formats, the function should provide an error message or request for further specification.\n\n2. **Contract Type**: \n   - The type of contract is a fundamental input, as it determines the structure and content of the agreement. This could range from employment contracts, service agreements, non-disclosure agreements, to lease contracts, among others.\n   - Edge Case: If the contract type is unrecognized or unsupported, the function should prompt the user to confirm or provide additional information.\n\n3. **Location**: \n   - The location parameter is essential since legal requirements and enforceability can vary significantly between jurisdictions. This includes specifying the country, state, or region where the contract is intended to be valid and enforced.\n   - Edge Case: In case the location falls under multiple legal jurisdictions, the function should clarify or ask for a more precise jurisdiction specification.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\n```python\ngenerate_custom_law_contract(\n    involved_parties=[\n        {\"name\": \"John Doe\", \"role\": \"Employer\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Jane Smith\", \"role\": \"Employee\"}\n    ],\n    contract_type=\"Employment Contract\",\n    location=\"California, USA", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"parties": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "Parties involved in the contract."}, "contract_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of the contract."}, "location": {"type": "string", "description": "Location where the contract will be in effect."}}, "required": ["parties", "contract_type", "location"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\n[generate_law_contract2(params_name1=({\"parties\": [\"John\", \"Alice\"], \"contract_type\": \"Rental Agreement\", \"location\": \"California, USA\"}))]", "model_result_decoded": [{"generate_law_contract2": {"params_name1": {"parties": ["John", "Alice"], "contract_type": "Rental Agreement", "location": "California, USA"}}}], "possible_answer": [{"generate_law_contract1": {"parties": [["John", "Alice"], ["John", "Alice"]], "contract_type": ["Rental Agreement", "rental agreement"], "location": ["California", "CA"]}}, {"generate_law_contract2": {"parties": [["John", "Alice"], ["John", "Alice"]], "contract_type": ["Rental Agreement", "rental agreement"], "location": ["California", "CA"]}}, {"generate_law_contract3": {"parties": [["John", "Alice"], ["John", "Alice"]], "contract_type": ["Rental Agreement", "rental agreement"], "location": ["California", "CA"]}}]}

For multiple commands, separate them with '&&'. For complex tasks, create and run a .bat file.This function is designed to execute a specified command or set of commands in the Windows operating environment by utilizing the `os.system()` function from Python's `os` module. The primary purpose of this function is to facilitate the execution of shell commands directly from a Python script when operating on a Windows platform. \n\nWhen you need to run several commands in succession, you can concatenate them into a single string, using the '&&' operator to separate each command. The '&&' operator ensures that the subsequent command is executed only if the preceding command completes successfully. This is particularly useful for combining simple commands into a single execution line, allowing for efficient scripting without the need for creating a separate script file.\n\nHowever, if you are dealing with a more complex series of tasks or commands that require intricate control flow, error handling, or involve multiple lines, it is recommended to create a batch file (.bat) instead. A batch file can encapsulate all the necessary commands and logic, providing a more organized and manageable way to execute complex sequences of operations. Once the batch file is created, you can use the function to run it, ensuring all contained commands are executed in the intended sequence.\n\nThis function is tailored specifically for the Windows operating system, and the use of `os.system()` is a straightforward method to invoke the command processor within Python scripts. While this method is convenient, it is important to be aware that it will not capture the output or error messages generated by the executed commands. For scenarios where output capturing is essential, consider using alternative methods such as `subprocess.run()`.\n\nUsage Example:\n```python\nimport os\n\n# To execute a single command\nos.system('echo Hello, World')\n\n# To execute multiple commands\nos.system('cd C:\\\\ && dir')\n\n# For more complex tasks, create and execute a .bat file\nos.system('my_script.bat')\n``` \n\nThis approach allows Python scripts to interact with the Windows command line, facilitating the automation of tasks and the integration of", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The Windows command line instruction(s) to be executed.

These factors include the total distance the vehicle travels over the course of a year, the type of fuel that it uses, and its fuel efficiency rating.\n\n### Parameters:\n\n1. **Distance Traveled**: This parameter represents the total mileage or distance that the vehicle covers within a year. It is typically measured in miles or kilometers. The greater the distance traveled, the higher the likelihood of increased emissions, assuming all other factors are constant.\n\n2. **Fuel Type**: The type of fuel used by the vehicle is a crucial determinant of its CO2 emissions. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, and alternative fuels such as electric or hybrid options. Each fuel type has a different carbon content and emission factor, affecting the overall emissions calculation.\n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency**: Fuel efficiency is usually measured in terms of miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km). It indicates how effectively a vehicle uses fuel. Vehicles with higher fuel efficiency consume less fuel over the same distance, leading to lower carbon emissions.\n\n### Calculation Considerations:\n\n- **Emission Factors**: The function utilizes predefined emission factors that correspond to each fuel type.

It is important to ensure that the date is valid and falls within the range for which forecast data is available. Future dates can generally be accommodated, but there might be limitations on how far in advance the forecast can be reliably retrieved. Similarly, past dates may not be supported as the function focuses primarily on forecasting rather than historical weather data.\n\n### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose you wish to find out the weather in Paris on December 25, 2023. You would call the function with the \"City\" parameter set to \"Paris\" and the \"Date\" parameter set to \"2023-12-25\". The function will then process this input, accessing a database of meteorological data to produce a forecast for Paris on that specific day.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n\n1. **Invalid City Name:** If the city name provided does not match any recognized locations in the meteorological database, the function may return an error or a null result. It is crucial to verify the spelling and formatting of the city name.\n   \n2. **Date Out of Range:** Providing a date that is", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["city"], "properties": {"city": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the city for which weather information is requested."}, "date": {"type": "string", "description": "The date for which weather information is requested, in the format of 'YYYY-MM-DD'.

Additionally, users must ensure that the date and time specified are in the correct format and fall within any restrictions or operating hours of the airline or booking system.\n\nHere is a usage example to illustrate how to use the function effectively:\n\n```python\nbook_direct_flight(departure_location=\"JFK\", destination_location=\"LAX\", date=\"2023-12-15\", time=\"14:30\")\n```\n\nIn this example, a direct flight is being booked from John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) in New York to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) in Los Angeles, scheduled for December 15, 2023, at 2:30 PM. This ensures that the traveler will fly directly to their destination without any stops, provided that the specified date and time are available.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"departure_location": {"type": "string", "description": "The location you are departing from."}, "destination_location": {"type": "string", "description": "The location you are flying to."}, "date": {"type": "string", "description": "The date of the flight.

Users can thereby tailor their search results to match their current interests or mood.\n\n- **Cast**: By specifying one or more cast members, users can refine their search to include only those movies featuring particular actors or actresses. This is particularly beneficial for fans of certain performers who wish to watch movies in which their favorite stars appear.\n\nThe function processes these parameters to generate a list that includes only those movies that meet all the specified criteria. It is important to note that if any of the parameters are left unspecified, the function will default to ignoring that specific filter, potentially returning a broader range of results. For instance, if only a director is specified, the function will return all movies directed by that person, regardless of genre or cast.\n\nExample usage: \nA user wants to find action movies directed by Christopher Nolan that feature Leonardo DiCaprio. They would specify the director as \"Christopher Nolan,\" the genre as \"action,\" and include \"Leonardo DiCaprio\" in the cast parameter. The function would then return titles such as \"Inception\" that match these criteria.\n\nThis functionality makes the function a powerful tool for users seeking to discover or explore films based on multiple intersecting attributes.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": [], "properties": {"directed_by": {"type": "string", "description": "Director of the movie.

Higher input or weight increases firing rate and higher decay rate decreases it.This function is designed to compute the neuronal activity, specifically the rate at which a neuron fires, by evaluating several key parameters: the input synaptic rate, the weight of the synaptic inputs, and the decay rate. Each of these parameters plays a critical role in determining the overall firing rate of the neuron.\n\nFirstly, the input synaptic rate refers to the frequency at which signals are received by the neuron from synapses. An increase in this rate implies that the neuron is receiving more frequent inputs, which in turn can lead to a higher neuronal firing rate. This parameter is crucial as it represents the external stimulation that a neuron receives and processes.\n\nSecondly, the weight of the inputs is a measure of the strength or efficacy of each synaptic input. A higher weight means that each individual input has a stronger effect on the neuron, contributing more significantly to the neuronal firing rate. This parameter typically reflects the importance or priority of certain inputs over others.\n\nLastly, the decay rate is a factor that reduces the overall firing rate of the neuron. It represents the natural tendency of the neuron's activity to diminish over time due to various inhibitory processes or energy constraints. A higher decay rate indicates stronger inhibitory effects or faster dissipation of the neuron's activity, thus lowering the overall firing rate.\n\nBy combining these parameters, the function calculates the rate of neuronal firing as a balance between excitatory inputs (input synaptic rate and weight) and inhibitory influences (decay rate). For instance, if both the input synaptic rate and weight of inputs are high, the neuron is more likely to fire at a higher rate, assuming the decay rate does not proportionately offset this effect. Conversely, if the decay rate is high, it counteracts the excitatory influences, leading to a lower firing rate.\n\nHere's an example of how this function might be used. Suppose you have a neuron with an input synaptic rate of 5 Hz, a synaptic weight of 2, and a decay rate of 1.

It is a utility that can be particularly useful for history enthusiasts, researchers, educators, and students who require accurate and detailed information about past events. The function operates by taking a specific historical event as input and returning the exact date associated with that event.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n- **event_name**: A string parameter representing the name or a brief description of the historical event whose date you wish to retrieve. This parameter should be as descriptive as possible to enable precise identification of the event, especially when dealing with events that might have common or similar names.\n\n#### Return Value\n\n- The function returns a string formatted as a date, typically in the \"YYYY-MM-DD\" format. This ensures that the information is clear and standardized, making it easy to integrate with other datasets or applications.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n\n- **Ambiguous Event Names**: If the event name provided is too vague or could refer to multiple events (e.g., \"World War\"), the function may return an error or prompt the user to provide additional information or context to narrow down the search.\n  \n- **Non-existent Events**: In cases where the event name does not match any known historical records, the function should handle such scenarios gracefully, potentially returning a message indicating that the date is not available or that the event could not be found.\n\n- **Date Format Variations**: While the function primarily returns the date in the \"YYYY-MM-DD\" format, users should be aware of any settings or options that might allow for different date formatting preferences.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\nHere's a simple example of how this function might be used in a practical context:\n\n```python\n# Example usage of the function\nevent_date = retrieve_event_date(\"Moon Landing\")\nprint(f\"The date of the Moon Landing is: {event_date}\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `retrieve_event", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"event": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the historical event."}, "location": {"type": "string", "description": "Location where the event took place.

Account for coverage efficiency of the paint and exclusions (like windows).The function is designed to determine the total amount of paint necessary to cover a specified area effectively. This calculation takes into account several critical factors to ensure accuracy. Firstly, the total area to be covered must be provided as an input parameter, typically measured in square units such as square feet or square meters, depending on the context.\n\nIn addition to the area itself, the function must also consider the paint's coverage efficiency, which is a measure of how much area a single unit of paint can cover. This efficiency is often provided by the paint manufacturer and is usually expressed in terms of square units per gallon or liter. By incorporating this efficiency factor, the function can accurately estimate the quantity of paint required, ensuring that there is neither a surplus nor a shortage.\n\nAnother important aspect of the calculation involves accounting for any exclusions within the area to be painted. These exclusions typically include features such as windows, doors, or any other elements that should not be painted. The function should allow input for the total area of these exclusions and subtract them from the overall area, thus refining the estimate to represent only the paintable surface.\n\nTo illustrate, consider the following usage example: if a room has a total wall area of 500 square feet, with windows and doors covering 50 square feet, and the paint covers 350 square feet per gallon, the function should first subtract the exclusion area (50 square feet) from the total area (500 square feet), resulting in 450 square feet of paintable surface. Then, it divides this by the coverage efficiency (350 square feet per gallon) to determine that approximately 1.29 gallons of paint are required. In practical terms, this would typically be rounded up to ensure complete coverage.\n\nIn summary, the function's purpose is to provide a precise estimate of the paint required by considering the total area, adjusting for paint coverage efficiency, and subtracting any areas that do not need painting.

The rectangle is defined by its dimensions, where the width represents the horizontal length, and the height signifies the vertical length of the shape.\n\n#### Parameters\n- **Width (w):** A numerical value that determines the horizontal extent of the rectangle. This parameter is crucial because it sets the length of the rectangle from one side to the opposite side, along the horizontal axis. Ensure that the value provided is positive and ideally a whole number, as negative or zero values do not logically represent a physical dimension and might cause the function to behave unexpectedly or not render a visible shape.\n  \n- **Height (h):** A numerical value indicating the vertical reach of the rectangle. Like the width, this parameter must be positive and is typically a whole number to ensure the shape is drawn correctly without errors. It defines how tall the rectangle is from its bottom side to its top side.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n- **Zero or Negative Dimensions:** If either the width or height is zero or negative, the function may not create a visible rectangle, as these values are not feasible for forming such a shape.\n- **Non-integer Dimensions:** Supplying non-integer values (e.g., floating-point numbers) might lead to rounding or truncation, depending on the implementation specifics of the function.

The analysis focuses on evaluating various aspects that are crucial for understanding the building's integrity, safety, and design efficiency.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **Id (string or integer):** This parameter serves as the unique identifier for the building. It allows the function to access specific data related to the building, ensuring that the analysis is accurate and relevant. The Id could be a string or an integer, depending on the database or system in use, and it must correspond to an existing record to avoid errors during the analysis process.\n\n- **floorNumbers (integer):** This parameter indicates the total number of floors within the building. It is crucial for assessing the building's vertical structure and helps in calculating aspects such as load distribution, structural stability, and emergency evacuation plans. The value must be a non-negative integer, as negative numbers or non-integers would not make physical sense in the context of a building's floors.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\nThe function leverages the Id to retrieve information about the building, such as its dimensions, materials used, load-bearing design, and architectural features, from a centralized database or repository. Using the provided number of floors, it can make calculations related to structural load distribution, potential stress points, and compliance with building codes and safety standards.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- If the Id does not match any existing building record, the function should handle this gracefully, possibly by returning a meaningful error message or an empty result indicating that the building cannot be found.\n\n- If the floorNumbers parameter is zero, this might indicate a non-standard structure, such as a pavilion or a single-floor design, which may require special handling in the analysis.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\n```python\n# Example of calling the AnalyzeBuildingStructure function\nresult = AnalyzeBuildingStructure(Id=12345, floorNumbers=10)\n```\n\nIn this example", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"building_id": {"type": "string", "description": "The unique identification number of the building."}, "floors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "integer"}, "description": "Floor numbers to be analyzed."}, "mode": {"type": "string", "description": "Mode of analysis, e.g. 'static' or 'dynamic'.

For example, specifying \"C Major\" will result in a melody that primarily uses the notes C, D, E, F, G, A, and B.\n\n2. **Tempo**: The tempo parameter sets the speed of the melody, typically measured in beats per minute (BPM). A higher BPM will result in a faster-paced melody, whereas a lower BPM will produce a more leisurely tempo. This parameter is crucial for aligning the generated melody with the intended mood or style.\n\n3. **Scale**: This parameter allows the user to specify the musical scale, such as major, minor, pentatonic, or blues. The chosen scale dictates the pattern of intervals used in the melody, adding a distinctive flavor to the composition and affecting its emotional character.\n\n4. **Rhythm**: The rhythm parameter defines the pattern of beats and rests within the melody. It shapes the timing and duration of notes, contributing to the melody's groove and syncopation. Users can specify simple rhythmic patterns or complex, syncopated sequences.\n\n5. **Melodic Range**: This parameter sets the pitch range within which the melody will be generated. It establishes the lowest and highest notes that will be included, allowing the user to control the register and density of the melody.\n\n6. **Structure**: The structure parameter provides a framework for organizing the melody into sections, such as verses, choruses, or bridges.

Common statistics provided might include:\n   - Total games played\n   - Number of wins and losses\n   - Points scored and points allowed\n   - Average points per game\n   - Percentage of games won (often called the win percentage)\n\nEdge Cases to Consider:\n- **Incomplete Seasons**: If the season is still ongoing, the function should handle partial data, offering up-to-date statistics and position as of the latest completed game.\n- **Tiebreakers**: In cases where teams have identical records, additional rules such as head-to-head results or point differentials may be used to determine precise rankings.\n- **Unavailable Data**: If historical data is not available for the requested season, the function should gracefully handle such scenarios, possibly by returning an informative error message or default values indicating unavailable data.\n\n**Usage Example**:\nTo retrieve the position and statistics for a team, you would typically specify the team identifier and the season of interest. An example call might look like:\n```python\nretrieve_team_stats(team_id='ABC123', season='2022-2023')\n```\nThis call would return a structured response containing both the team's standing and detailed statistical breakdown for the specified season.\n\n**Parameters**:\n- `team_id`: A unique identifier for the basketball team.

The function takes into consideration the total hand values of the player and the dealer, determining the winner by comparing their scores while adhering to the constraints of the game.\n\n#### Functionality\n\nThe primary task of this function is to compute the final scores of both the player and the dealer after all drawing and betting actions have concluded. The scores are calculated by summing the values of the cards in each hand, with face cards (King, Queen, and Jack) valued at 10, numerals valued as per their number, and Aces valued at either 1 or 11, depending on which option best enhances the hand without causing a bust (exceeding a total of 21).\n\n#### Determination Process\n\n1. **Bust Condition**: \n   - If the player's total exceeds 21, the player automatically loses, resulting in a dealer win, regardless of the dealer's hand.\n   - Similarly, if the dealer's total exceeds 21, the dealer loses, and the function declares the player as the winner.\n\n2. **Blackjack Condition**:\n   - If the player has a total of 21 with exactly two cards (known as a natural blackjack), and the dealer does not, the player is declared the winner.\n   - Conversely, if the dealer has a natural blackjack and the player does not, the dealer is declared the winner.\n\n3. **Comparing Totals**:\n   - If neither party busts or achieves a natural blackjack, the function compares the totals of both hands.\n   - The hand with the total nearer to 21 is declared the winner.\n   - If both totals are equal, the result is a tie, often referred to as a \"push,\" where no party wins.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n\n- **Both Have Blackjack**: If both the", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"player_cards": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "Cards held by the player."}, "dealer_cards": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "Cards held by the dealer."}, "ace_value": {"type": "integer", "description": "The value considered for the ace card, can be either 1 or 11.", "default": 11}}, "required": ["player_cards", "dealer_cards"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\nblackjack.check_winner1({'player_cards': ['A', '10'], 'dealer_cards': ['10', '9'], 'ace_value': 1})", "model_result_decoded": [{"blackjack.check_winner1": {}}], "possible_answer": [{"blackjack.check_winner1": {"player_cards": [["A", "10"]], "dealer_cards": [["10", "9"]], "ace_value": [1]}}, {"blackjack.check_winner2": {"player_cards": [["A", "10"]], "dealer_cards": [["10", "9"]], "ace_value": [1]}}, {"blackjack.check_winner3": {"player_cards": [["A", "10"]], "dealer_cards": [["10", "9"]], "ace_value": [1]}}]}

To achieve this, the function takes two distinct parameters: `rank` and `suit`. The `rank` parameter represents the value of the card, which can vary from numbers such as 2 through 10 to face cards like Jack, Queen, King, and Ace. The second parameter, `suit`, indicates one of the four possible categories: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, or Spades. By providing these parameters, the function systematically searches through the deck to identify and locate the card that exactly matches both the specified rank and suit.\n\nThe function assumes that the input deck is a complete set of 52 playing cards, each uniquely defined by a combination of rank and suit. If the deck is structured as a list or array, the function would iterate over each card, comparing the rank and suit of each card in the deck to the provided parameters. In the case of a successful match, the function would return the position or details of the located card within the deck. Conversely, if no card matches the given criteria, the function might return a special value, such as `null` or `-1`, to indicate that the card is not present in the deck.\n\nAn edge case to consider is when the deck of cards is incomplete or contains duplicates, which may affect the function's ability to locate the card accurately. Additionally, if either the `rank` or `suit` parameters are invalid (e.g., a rank of 15 or a suit named \"Stars\"), the function needs to handle these cases, possibly by returning an error message or throwing an exception.\n\nHere is an example of how the function could be used:\n\n```python\n# Assume the deck is a list of card objects, each with 'rank' and 'suit' attributes\ndeck = [\n    {'rank': '2', 'suit", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"rank": {"type": "string", "description": "Rank of the card (e.g. Ace, Two, King)."}, "suit": {"type": "string", "description": "Suit of the card (e.g. Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, Clubs)."}, "deck": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"rank": {"type": "string"}, "suit": {"type": "string"}}}, "description": "Deck of cards.

A full house is a specific hand combination in poker where a player has three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank, such as three 8s and two Kings. This function takes into account the standard 52-card deck used in poker, which consists of four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades, with each suit containing 13 ranks from Ace through King.\n\nTo calculate this probability, the function likely employs combinatorial mathematics, specifically the concepts of combinations and permutations, to determine the number of ways a full house can be formed. It then divides this by the total number of possible 5-card hands that can be dealt from the deck. With a 52-card deck, the total number of possible hands is calculated as \"52 choose 5\", which represents the number of combinations of 52 cards taken 5 at a time.\n\nThe function's output is a probability value, usually expressed as a decimal or a percentage, indicating the likelihood of being dealt a full house in a single hand of poker. It's important to note that this function assumes a fair and random distribution of cards. Additionally, it presumes no prior knowledge of other players' cards or any cards that may have been discarded, thus providing an unbiased statistical probability.\n\nExample usage of this function might involve invoking it without any additional parameters, as the calculation only depends on the fixed properties of a standard deck of cards.

It allows users to tailor their search based on three key criteria: dietary restrictions, available ingredients, and the desired number of servings. Below is an expanded description of each parameter and how the function utilizes them to return the most relevant recipes:\n\n1. **Dietary Restriction**: This parameter allows users to specify any dietary needs or limitations they might have. Common dietary restrictions include gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian, nut-free, dairy-free, and more. When this parameter is specified, the function filters out recipes that do not comply with the stated requirement, ensuring that only suitable options are returned. This is particularly useful for individuals with allergies or specific dietary goals.\n\n2. **Ingredients**: The function lets users input a list of ingredients they have on hand. This parameter helps narrow down the search results to recipes that can be made with the specified ingredients. It ensures that users can make the recipes without needing to procure additional items, adding convenience and reducing food waste. The function cross-references these ingredients against the recipes in its database to find matches or suggest close alternatives where possible.\n\n3. **Number of Servings**: Users can set the desired number of servings, which tailors the recipe search to yield options that can feed the specified number of people. This parameter is especially useful for planning meals for gatherings or ensuring that recipes match the household size. The function checks recipes that can be scaled up or down to achieve the precise number of servings and includes suggestions on how to adjust ingredient quantities if needed.\n\n### Usage Example\n\nA user wants to find a recipe that is gluten-free, uses chicken and broccoli, and serves four people. By inputting \"gluten-free\" for the dietary restriction, \"chicken, broccoli\" for the ingredients, and \"4\" for the number of servings, the function will search its database and return a list of recipes that fit these criteria", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"dietary_restriction": {"type": "string", "description": "The dietary restriction, e.g., 'Vegetarian'."}, "ingredients": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "The list of ingredients."}, "servings": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of servings the recipe should make"}}, "required": ["dietary_restriction", "ingredients", "servings"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\n[recipe_search1({'dietary_restriction': 'vegetarian', 'ingredients': [], 'servings': 2}), {'note': 'Please provide specific ingredients you have on hand for a more accurate recipe.'}]", "possible_answer": [{"recipe_search1": {"dietary_restriction": ["Vegetarian"], "ingredients": [["pasta", "cheese"]], "servings": [2]}}, {"recipe_search2": {"dietary_restriction": ["Vegetarian"], "ingredients": [["pasta", "cheese"]], "servings": [2]}}, {"recipe_search3": {"dietary_restriction": ["Vegetarian"], "ingredients": [["pasta", "cheese"]], "servings": [2]}}]}

It is important that the city name is correctly spelled and formatted to match the data source the function accesses. This ensures that the function can correctly interpret the input and provide accurate recommendations.\n\n2. **Review Rate**: This parameter represents the quality rating that each sushi place has received, typically on a scale (for example, from 1 to 5 stars). The function uses these review rates to assess and compare the quality of sushi places within the specified city. Higher review rates usually indicate better customer satisfaction and can help prioritize the sushi places returned by the function.\n\n3. **Top Number**: This parameter indicates the number of top sushi places you want the function to return. It allows users to specify how many restaurants they are interested in seeing, providing flexibility depending on the user's preference for a broader or more selective list. For example, setting this parameter to 5 will instruct the function to return the top 5 sushi places that match the criteria.\n\nThe function processes these inputs and evaluates sushi restaurants in the specified city by considering their review rates.

For instance, converting between dry and liquid ingredients might require a different approach due to differences in density and volume.\n\nAn example of how this function might be used is converting 2 cups of flour to its equivalent in grams. The user would input \"2 cups\" as the original value and unit, and specify \"grams\" as the desired unit. The function would then calculate the equivalent weight in grams, taking into account the specific density of flour.\n\nThis functionality is particularly useful for chefs, home cooks, and culinary professionals who frequently encounter recipes written in different units. By standardizing measurements, the function helps maintain consistency in cooking results and ensures that ingredient proportions remain correct, regardless of the measurement units originally provided in a recipe.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"value": {"type": "integer", "description": "The value to be converted."}, "from_unit": {"type": "string", "description": "The unit to convert from.

It operates based on specific parameters which typically include the weight of the chicken and the desired cooking method or temperature, though the exact variables may vary depending on implementation. The cooking time is essential to ensure that the chicken is neither undercooked, which can pose health risks, nor overcooked, which can affect texture and taste.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **weight (float or int):** The weight of the chicken, usually measured in pounds or kilograms. This is a critical parameter as the cooking time is generally proportional to the weight of the chicken to ensure even and thorough cooking.\n- **method (optional, string):** This may refer to the cooking method or temperature setting, such as \"convection,\" \"standard oven,\" or specific temperature settings in degrees Fahrenheit or Celsius. This helps adjust the time calculation to accommodate different cooking conditions.\n\n#### Details:\n- The function typically calculates the total cooking time by applying a standard rule of thumb, often around 20 minutes per pound at a given temperature, plus an additional fixed time to account for initial heating and resting.\n- Additional adjustments may be made for variables such as whether the chicken is stuffed, as this can increase cooking time.\n- The function might return the total time in minutes or hours, depending on the required precision or user preference.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- **Zero or Negative Weight:** If the weight is zero or negative, the function should handle this gracefully, potentially by returning an error or warning message.\n- **Unusual Cooking Methods:** If an unrecognized method is provided, the function might default to a standard method or alert the user to input a valid option.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nTo calculate the cooking time for a 5-pound chicken using a standard oven, you might invoke the function as follows:\n\n```python\ncooking_time = calculate_cooking_time(weight=5, method=\"", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"weight_kg": {"type": "float", "description": "The weight of the chicken in kilograms."}, "cooking_method": {"type": "string", "description": "The method of cooking, defaults to 'roast'."}, "temp_celsius": {"type": "integer", "description": "The cooking temperature in degrees celsius, defaults to 180."}}, "required": ["weight_kg"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\ncalculate_cooking_time1({'weight_kg': 1.5}), calculate_cooking_time2({'weight_kg': 1.5, 'method': 'roast'})", "model_result_decoded": [{"calculate_cooking_time1": {}}, {"calculate_cooking_time2": {}}], "possible_answer": [{"calculate_cooking_time1": {"weight_kg": [1.5], "cooking_method": ["", "roast"], "temp_celsius": ["", 180]}}, {"calculate_cooking_time2": {"weight_kg": [1.5], "cooking_method": ["", "roast"], "temp_celsius": ["", 180]}}, {"calculate_cooking_time3": {"weight_kg": [1.5], "cooking_method": ["", "roast"], "temp_celsius": ["", 180]}}]}

These scenarios would require the function to handle errors gracefully, possibly by returning an error message or providing alternative solutions such as suggesting different hotels or dates.\n\nAn example usage of this function might involve a user calling the function with the parameters indicating their desired stay at the \"Grand Palace Hotel\" from \"2023-11-01\" to \"2023-11-05\" in a \"Deluxe Suite.\" The function would then process this request, check for availability, and confirm the booking, returning a confirmation number or an appropriate response to indicate success or failure of the booking operation.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"hotel_name": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the hotel."}, "room_type": {"type": "string", "description": "The type of room to be booked."}, "num_nights": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of nights to book the room for."}}, "required": ["hotel_name", "room_type", "num_nights"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\n[func_name1(params_name1=The_Plaza_hotel, params_name2=single, params_name3=2)]", "model_result_decoded": [{"func_name1": {"params_name1": "The_Plaza_hotel", "params_name2": "single", "params_name3": 2}}], "possible_answer": [{"book_room1": {"hotel_name": ["The Plaza"], "room_type": ["Single", "single"], "num_nights": [2]}}, {"book_room2": {"hotel_name": ["The Plaza"], "room_type": ["Single", "single"], "num_nights": [2]}}, {"book_room3": {"hotel_name": ["The Plaza"], "room_type": ["Single", "single"], "num_nights": [2]}}]}
