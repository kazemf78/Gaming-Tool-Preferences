Prime factorization involves expressing the integer as a product of prime numbers, which are numbers that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The function takes a single integer input, which must be a positive integer greater than 1, as prime factorization is not defined for numbers less than 2.\n\nWhen the function is called with an appropriate integer input, it determines the smallest prime number that divides the integer without leaving a remainder. It records this prime number as a factor and divides the input integer by this prime.

At this point, the list of prime factors collected provides the complete prime factorization of the original integer.\n\nIt is important to note that the function should be able to handle a variety of edge cases, such as very large integers, ensuring that it accurately provides a prime factorization regardless of the size of the input. Additionally, the function should efficiently manage scenarios where the input is a prime number, swiftly identifying that the number is its own prime factorization.\n\nFor example, if the function is called with the integer 28, the output would be the list [2, 2, 7], representing that 28 is equal to 2 multiplied by 2 and multiplied by 7.

It searches based on certain criteria, such as the operating hours of each establishment, to ensure that the results are relevant and align with users' availability.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **Location**: The geographical area or specific coordinates from which the search will be conducted. This input is crucial to determine the radius within which the vegan restaurants will be located.\n  \n- **Operating Hours**: A filter criterion that allows users to specify the time frame during which they are interested in visiting a restaurant. This ensures that only restaurants open during these hours are considered in the search results.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\nThe function performs the following tasks to provide a list of vegan restaurants:\n\n1. **Data Collection**: It gathers data on vegan restaurants within the specified vicinity. This includes extracting information about each restaurant's menu, location, and operating hours.\n\n2. **Filtering by Operating Hours**: Once the list of potential restaurants is compiled, the function applies a filter based on the operating hours provided by the user. This step eliminates any restaurants that do not match the desired visiting time frame.\n\n3. **Distance Calculation**: The function calculates the distance from the specified location to each restaurant, helping to prioritize results that are closest to the user.\n\n4. **Result Compilation**: Finally, the function compiles a list of vegan restaurants that meet all specified criteria, sorted by distance, availability, or other user-defined preferences.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Non-Overlapping Hours**: If no restaurants are open during the specified operating hours, the function should handle this gracefully by either returning an empty list or suggesting alternate times or nearby locations with a higher probability of open establishments.\n\n- **Ambiguous Location**: If the location input is ambiguous or cannot be pinpointed to a specific area, the function should request additional information or provide a default search radius to proceed.\n\n#### Example Usage:\n\n```python\n#", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"location": {"type": "string", "description": "The city and state, e.g. New York, NY, you should format it as City, State."}, "operating_hours": {"type": "integer", "description": "Preferred latest closing time of the restaurant.

It is important to note that this function is restricted to sending just one value at a time, ensuring that the command received is clear and unambiguous. This limitation is particularly useful when precise control is required over the appliance's operations, as it prevents any potential conflicts that could arise from sending multiple commands simultaneously.\n\n### Usage Example\n\nSuppose you are working with a smart home system where you need to adjust the temperature setting on a smart thermostat. Using this function, you can send a specific temperature value, such as 72 degrees Fahrenheit, to the thermostat. The function call would look something like this:\n\n```python\nsend_command_to_appliance(72)\n```\n\nIn this example, `72` represents the single value being sent to control the appliance.\n\n### Parameter Explanation\n\n- **value (int/float/string)**: The command value to be sent to the appliance. This parameter represents the exact instruction the appliance will receive. Depending on the appliance's capabilities, this value could be an integer, a floating-point number, or even a specific string command understood by the appliance.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- **Invalid Values**: If the value sent is not recognized by the appliance, it may result in an error or the appliance may ignore the command altogether. It is crucial to ensure that the value conforms to the expected input range or format for the appliance being controlled.\n- **Network Issues**: In scenarios where the command relies on network communication, issues such as connectivity problems or latency might affect the successful transmission of the command. It is advisable to include error-checking mechanisms to confirm the command was successfully received and executed by the appliance.\n\nOverall, the function provides a streamlined method for issuing a single, distinct command to an appliance, making it an essential tool for tasks that require direct and specific control.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["body"], "properties": {"body": {"type": "dict", "description": "A dictionary containing the parameters for the appliance command.", "properties": {"airConJobMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The current job mode of the air conditioner.", "enum": ["AIR_CLEAN", "COOL", "AIR_DRY"], "default": "COOL"}, "windStrength": {"type": "string", "description": "The strength of the air flow.", "enum": ["LOW", "HIGH", "MID"], "default": "MID"}, "monitoringEnabled": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether air quality sensor monitoring is enabled.", "default": false}, "airCleanOperationMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The operation mode for the air cleaning function.", "enum": ["START", "STOP"], "default": "STOP"}, "airConOperationMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The operation mode for the air conditioner, indicating if it is turned on or off.", "enum": ["POWER_ON", "POWER_OFF"], "default": "POWER_OFF"}, "powerSaveEnabled": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether power save mode is enabled to conserve energy.", "default": false}, "targetTemperature": {"type": "integer", "description": "The target temperature to set for the appliance, in degrees Celsius.", "default": 20}, "relativeHourToStop": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of hours from the current time when the appliance should stop.

Examples of classifications might include 'Billing Issue,' 'Technical Support,' 'Product Inquiry,' or 'Feedback.'\n\n- **Timestamp:** The date and time when the query was classified. This is crucial for maintaining an accurate timeline of when queries are processed and addressed.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n- If a query does not match any existing classification type, there should be a default classification to ensure no queries remain unclassified, or the system should prompt for the creation of a new classification category.\n\n- In cases where a query is reclassified, the system should update the classification record accordingly to reflect the most current category, potentially retaining the history of changes for auditing purposes.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\nImagine a scenario where a customer calls with a complaint about a delayed shipment. The customer service representative would use this function to assign the query a unique ID, classify it under the 'Shipping Issue' category, and record the exact time at which the classification was made. This information is then stored in the system for future reference, allowing for trends in shipping issues to be analyzed over time.\n\nBy implementing this function, organizations can enhance their customer service operations, leading to more efficient query management and insightful data analysis, ultimately contributing to improved customer satisfaction.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["money_movement_start", "get_transactions_start", "credit_limit_increase_start", "faq_link_accounts_start"], "properties": {"money_movement_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries for transferring funds between accounts."}, "get_transactions_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries for viewing transactions, including deposits, purchases, and transaction details."}, "credit_limit_increase_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of customer requests to increase credit card limits or complaints about the current limit."}, "faq_link_accounts_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries related to linking accounts within the bank's system."}}}}]}, "model_result_raw": "Error during inference: invalid syntax.

Compound interest is a method of calculating interest where the interest earned over time is added to the principal, and from that point forward, interest is calculated on this new principal amount. This function takes into account several key parameters: the initial principal amount, the annual interest rate, the number of times interest is compounded per year, and the total number of years the money is invested or borrowed for.\n\nTo use this function effectively, the user must provide:\n\n1. **Principal Amount**: This is the initial sum of money that is invested or borrowed.

Specifically, this function is intended for use on Windows operating systems, where it provides the capability to run commands in the Windows command line environment.\n\nThe core functionality of this function includes the execution of a single command or, if needed, multiple commands that are strategically linked together using the '&&' operator.

This functionality allows for the execution of command-line operations directly from within a Python script, thereby enabling automation of tasks that would typically require manual execution through a command prompt.\n\nWhen using this function, you have the flexibility to execute either a single command or a series of commands chained together. Chaining is achieved by using the '&&' operator, which allows you to execute multiple commands sequentially. In this context, the '&&' operator ensures that each command is executed in order, and the subsequent command is only executed if the preceding command is successful. This feature is particularly useful for tasks that depend on the successful completion of prior commands.\n\nFor instance, if you need to navigate to a specific directory and then list the files within that directory, you could chain these commands as follows: `cd path\\to\\directory && dir`.

The calculation is based on three primary factors: the distance the vehicle travels in a year, the type of fuel used by the vehicle, and its fuel efficiency.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n1. **Distance Traveled (annual_distance):** This represents the total distance covered by the vehicle over the course of a year. It is usually measured in miles or kilometers, depending on the preferred unit system. Accurate input of this parameter is crucial as it directly influences the resulting emissions calculation.\n\n2. **Fuel Type (fuel_type):** This denotes the type of fuel the vehicle uses. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, natural gas, and electricity. Different fuels emit varying amounts of CO2 when consumed, and this parameter allows the function to use the appropriate emission factor for the calculation. \n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency (fuel_efficiency):** This is a measure of how effectively a vehicle uses fuel, typically expressed in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). Higher fuel efficiency indicates that the vehicle can travel more distance using less fuel, thus producing fewer emissions for the same distance traveled.\n\n**Calculation Process:**\n\nThe core calculation involves determining the total fuel consumption for the given distance based on the vehicle's fuel efficiency. Once the total fuel consumption is established, the function applies the specific emission factor associated with the fuel type to calculate the total CO2 emissions. The emission factor is a standard value that indicates the amount of CO2 released per unit of fuel consumed.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n- **Extreme Values for Distance:** When calculating emissions for vehicles that travel extremely high or low annual distances, ensure that the inputs remain realistic. For instance, commuting vehicles may have significantly lower distances compared to long-haul trucks.\n\n- **Fuel Efficiency Limits:** Consider edge cases where fuel efficiency is unusually high or", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"distance": {"type": "integer", "description": "The distance travelled in miles."}, "fuel_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of fuel used by the vehicle."}, "fuel_efficiency": {"type": "float", "description": "The vehicle's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon."}, "efficiency_reduction": {"type": "integer", "description": "The percentage decrease in fuel efficiency per year (optional).

The function takes into account various factors, such as the type and amount of energy consumed, the specific renewable energy source being utilized, and the efficiency of both the conventional and renewable systems.\n\nAn important aspect of this calculation is to evaluate the carbon footprint of the current energy usage and what reduction in greenhouse gases can be expected as a result of this transition.

It takes into consideration the hands of both the player and the dealer, comparing their values to ascertain who has won the round.\n\nIn a typical game of blackjack, the objective is to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. This function will compare the point totals of the player\u2019s hand to the dealer\u2019s hand.

A standard deck consists of 52 cards, which are divided into four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit contains 13 cards, ranging from Ace to King. The total number of unique cards in the deck ensures various combinations and probabilities based on the desired card or suit.\n\nThe probability of drawing a specific card, such as the Queen of Hearts, is determined by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes in the deck.

This function takes into account the most efficient or fastest route available based on current road conditions, traffic patterns, and other relevant factors that might affect travel by car. It computes the distance, typically in miles or kilometers, and estimates the time needed to complete the journey, usually expressed in minutes or hours.\n\nParameters for this function generally include the starting location and the destination location, which can be input as addresses, GPS coordinates, or specific landmarks. Users may need to ensure that the input locations are valid and recognizable by the system. The function may utilize real-time data from GPS and traffic services to provide an accurate and up-to-date estimate. \n\nEdge cases to consider include scenarios where one or both locations are unreachable by car, such as remote areas without road access, or temporary road closures. In such cases, the function might return an error or a message indicating that the travel route cannot be calculated. Additionally, if there are multiple possible routes, the function might default to the fastest or shortest one, although it could be configured to offer alternative options if needed.\n\nFor example, a user seeking to retrieve this information could input a starting location as \"1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA\" and a destination as \"One Apple Park Way, Cupertino, CA.\" The function would then calculate the optimal route, returning a travel distance, say 40 miles, and an estimated travel time, such as 50 minutes, assuming normal traffic conditions.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"start_location": {"type": "string", "description": "Starting point of the journey"}, "end_location": {"type": "string", "description": "Ending point of the journey"}, "traffic": {"type": "boolean", "description": "If true, considers current traffic.
