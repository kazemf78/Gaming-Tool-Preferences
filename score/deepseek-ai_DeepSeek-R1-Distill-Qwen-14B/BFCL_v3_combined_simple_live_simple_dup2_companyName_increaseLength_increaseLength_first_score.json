This is a critical operation in various areas of mathematics and computer science, such as cryptography, number theory, and algorithm design.\n\nThe function works by iterating through possible divisors, starting from the smallest prime number, which is 2.

The function then systematically divides the number by the smallest prime numbers, starting with 2, and continues with higher prime numbers until the input number is reduced to 1. Each time the input number is divisible by a prime number, that prime number is added to the list of prime factors, and the input number is divided by that prime.

This calculation is rooted in the kinematic equations of motion, specifically the formula that relates velocity, acceleration, and distance when the initial velocity is zero:\n\n\\[ v_f = \\sqrt{2 \\times a \\times d} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( v_f \\) is the final velocity of the object.\n- \\( a \\) is the acceleration of the object.\n- \\( d \\) is the distance traveled by the object.\n\nThe function takes two parameters:\n1. **acceleration (a)**: A non-negative numerical value representing the rate of change of velocity per unit time. It is expected to be in units consistent with the distance parameter, such as meters per second squared (m/s\u00b2) if distance is measured in meters.\n2. **distance (d)**: A non-negative numerical value representing the total length of the path traveled by the object. The distance should be in units that are compatible with the units of acceleration, such as meters.\n\nThe function returns the final velocity as a positive numerical value, computed using the square root of twice the product of acceleration and distance.

In such scenarios, the function is expected to efficiently identify the inadequacy of the input and promptly return the default response without attempting further processing.\n\nFor example, if the input string is \"What is the meaning of life?\" and the function's criteria for validity are met, it may attempt to provide a meaningful answer. However, if the input string is a series of random characters or an unrelated data entry, the function will recognize the absence of validity and return the default response accordingly.\n\nThe function's ability to accurately differentiate between valid and invalid inputs is crucial for maintaining the integrity of its output.

Entropy, a measure of disorder or randomness in a system, is a fundamental concept in thermodynamics, particularly in understanding energy distribution and efficiency.\n\n### Parameters\n\n- **initial_temperature (T)**: This parameter represents the constant temperature at which the process occurs. It is crucial that this temperature remains constant throughout the process to ensure it is isothermal. The temperature is generally expressed in Kelvin (K) to maintain consistency with thermodynamic calculations.\n\n- **heat_transfer (Q)**: The heat transferred into or out of the system during the process. For a reversible process, this transfer must occur in such a way that the system remains in equilibrium with its surroundings at every stage. The heat transfer is typically measured in joules (J).\n\n### Calculation Details\n\nThe entropy change for an isothermal and reversible process is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta S = \\frac{Q}{T}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\Delta S \\) is the change in entropy.\n- \\( Q \\) is the heat transferred.\n- \\( T \\) is the constant absolute temperature at which the process occurs.\n\n### Edge Cases and Considerations\n\n- **Zero Heat Transfer**: If the heat transfer (\\( Q \\)) is zero, the change in entropy (\\( \\Delta S \\)) will also be zero. This occurs when no energy enters or leaves the system as heat, which could be a hypothetical scenario in a perfectly isolated system.\n\n- **Negative Heat Transfer**: In cases where heat is removed from the system (\\( Q \\) is negative), the entropy change will also be negative, indicating a decrease in the system's disorder as it loses energy.\n\n- **Temperature Constraints**: The function assumes that the input temperature (\\( T \\)) is", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"initial_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial temperature in Kelvin."}, "final_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The final temperature in Kelvin."}, "heat_capacity": {"type": "integer", "description": "The heat capacity in J/K."}, "isothermal": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether the process is isothermal.

This formula should adhere to standard chemical notation, where elements are represented by their chemical symbols (e.g., H for hydrogen, O for oxygen) followed by numerical subscripts indicating the number of atoms of each element in the compound. For example, the formula for water is H2O, and that for glucose is C6H12O6.\n\n#### Functionality:\n- The function parses the input string `compound_formula` to identify each element and its corresponding subscript.\n- It retrieves the atomic weight of each element from a pre-defined database or periodic table, which contains the standard atomic weights of elements.\n- It multiplies the atomic weight of each element by the number of times it occurs (as indicated by the subscript in the formula) to determine the total weight contributed by that element.\n- It sums the weights contributed by all elements to calculate the total molecular weight of the compound.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- The function assumes that the input formula is correctly formatted according to chemical conventions.\n- It should handle simple compounds with single elements as well as complex organic compounds.\n- The function should be robust against common formatting errors, such as missing subscripts, by assuming a subscript of 1 if no number is specified.\n- The function should also handle cases of isotopes if the atomic weights are specified as averages and are included in the database.\n\n#### Example Usage:\n- For a simple compound like water (H2O), the function will identify two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.

It requires the unique identifiers (UUIDs) of each of these entities as input parameters. By accepting these UUIDs, the function queries the system's database to gather comprehensive analysis data linked to the specified entities.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n1. **Project UUID (Universal Unique Identifier):** This parameter uniquely identifies the project within the database. It ensures that the function targets the correct project when retrieving analysis data. The UUID is typically a 128-bit number used to uniquely identify resources.\n\n2. **Component UUID:** Similar to the project UUID, this parameter identifies a specific component within the project. Components are distinct parts of a project, and their UUIDs help in pinpointing the exact component whose analysis trail is being requested.\n\n3. **Vulnerability UUID:** This uniquely identifies a specific vulnerability that has been detected in the component. Vulnerability UUIDs are crucial for tracking security issues and understanding their impact within the context of a project.\n\n**Functionality and Edge Cases:**\n\n- The function performs a lookup in the database using the provided UUIDs to compile a trail of analysis. This trail may include information such as the findings, timestamps of analyses, risk assessments, and any actions taken regarding the vulnerability.\n  \n- If any of the provided UUIDs do not exist in the database, the function should handle this gracefully, likely by returning an error message indicating that one or more UUIDs are invalid or not found.\n\n- The function should also consider the possibility of null or improperly formatted UUIDs, which could lead to errors in data retrieval. Proper validation of the input parameters is necessary to ensure accurate results.\n\n- It is important for the function to manage database access efficiently to prevent performance bottlenecks, especially when dealing with large datasets or multiple simultaneous requests.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\nTo use this function, a developer would pass the specific UUIDs of the project, component", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["project", "component", "vulnerability"], "properties": {"project": {"type": "string", "description": "The unique identifier (UUID) of the project."}, "component": {"type": "string", "description": "The unique identifier (UUID) of the component within the project."}, "vulnerability": {"type": "string", "description": "The unique identifier (UUID) of the vulnerability associated with the component."}}}}, {"name": "analysis_api.AnalysisApi.retrieve_analysis2", "description": "Retrieves the trail of analysis for a given project, component, and vulnerability based on their respective UUIDs.

Returns a list of times in seconds, each representing the occurrence of a significant beat within the audio file.The function is designed to perform an analysis of an audio file with the primary goal of detecting beats. It carefully examines the audio data to identify moments that correspond to significant beats, which are rhythmic events typically associated with music or other structured audio. Once these beats have been detected, the function applies a filtering process based on two main criteria: confidence levels and timing.\n\nConfidence levels refer to the certainty or reliability of each detected beat. During the analysis, the function assigns a confidence score to each detected beat, indicating how likely it is to be an actual beat rather than noise or an artifact. Only those beats that meet or exceed a certain confidence threshold are considered significant and retained in the final result.\n\nTiming, the second criterion, relates to the temporal placement of the detected beats within the audio file. The function ensures that the beats are evaluated and filtered based on their precise timing, ensuring that the beats included in the final output are not only confident but also well-timed within the context of the audio sequence.\n\nAfter the filtering process has been completed, the function returns a list. This list consists of numerical values, each representing a specific point in time, measured in seconds, at which a significant beat occurs within the audio file. These time values provide a clear and concise way to identify the timing of important rhythmic events throughout the duration of the audio.\n\nFor example, if an audio file contains several prominent drum hits or bass beats, the function will analyze the file, detect these beats, and output a list of times\u2014such as [0.5, 1.7, 3.0]\u2014each indicating when a significant beat occurs.

The Random Forest algorithm is a popular ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. It is widely used for its ability to handle large datasets with higher dimensions and for its robustness against overfitting.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **data**: The dataset on which the Random Forest model will be trained. This should include both predictor variables (features) and target variables (labels), formatted as a DataFrame or a similar tabular structure. The dataset should be pre-processed before being passed to the function, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing or standardizing features if necessary.\n\n- **n_estimators** (optional): An integer specifying the number of trees in the forest. More trees generally improve the performance but also increase computational cost and memory usage. A typical default value is 100, but this can be adjusted based on dataset size and performance considerations.\n\n- **max_depth** (optional): The maximum depth of the tree. Limiting the depth can prevent overfitting, especially with smaller datasets. If not specified, nodes are expanded until all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain fewer than `min_samples_split` samples.\n\n- **random_state** (optional): Controls the randomness of the bootstrapping of the samples and the selection of features when looking for the best split at each node. Setting this parameter ensures reproducibility of results.\n\n#### Returns:\n\n- **model**: The trained Random Forest model object. This object can be used to make predictions on new data using the `predict` method, and it can be further evaluated using metrics such as accuracy for classification tasks or mean squared error for regression tasks.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nHere is a basic example of how this function might be used in practice:", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"n_estimators": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of trees in the forest."}, "max_depth": {"type": "integer", "description": "The maximum depth of the tree."}, "data": {"type": "any", "description": "The training data for the model."}}, "required": ["n_estimators", "max_depth", "data"]}}, {"name": "random_forest.train2", "description": "Train a Random Forest Model on given data Trusted by OpenAI.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"n_estimators": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of trees in the forest."}, "max_depth": {"type": "integer", "description": "The maximum depth of the tree."}, "data": {"type": "any", "description": "The training data for the model."}}, "required": ["n_estimators", "max_depth", "data"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\n[ random_forest.train1(data=my_data, n_estimators=100, max_depth=5) ]", "possible_answer": [{"random_forest.train1": {"n_estimators": [100], "max_depth": [5], "data": ["my_data"]}}, {"random_forest.train2": {"n_estimators": [100], "max_depth": [5], "data": ["my_data"]}}, {"random_forest.train3": {"n_estimators": [100], "max_depth": [5], "data": ["my_data"]}}]}

The coefficient of determination is a statistical measure that is used to assess the goodness of fit of the model, indicating how well the observed outcomes are replicated by the model given the input data. R\u00b2 values range from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 implies that the regression model perfectly predicts the dependent variable, and a value of 0 indicates that the model does not predict the dependent variable at all.\n\nThis function typically requires two key inputs: the actual observed values and the predicted values produced by the regression model. The actual values represent the true data points for the dependent variable, while the predicted values are the estimates generated by the model based on the independent variables.\n\nThe function works by comparing the variance of the residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values) to the variance of the observed data. It calculates the total sum of squares (TSS), which represents the total variance in the observed data, and the residual sum of squares (RSS), which measures the variance explained by the model's errors. R\u00b2 is then computed as:\n\nR\u00b2 = 1 - (RSS / TSS)\n\nThis formula provides the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. In practical terms, a higher R\u00b2 value generally indicates a better fit of the model to the data, suggesting that a larger proportion of the variance in the dependent variable is captured by the model. However, it is important to note that a high R\u00b2 does not necessarily imply that the model is appropriate or free from bias, and other statistical measures should also be considered when evaluating the performance of a regression model.\n\nUsage Example:\nSuppose you have a dataset containing actual sales figures and corresponding predicted sales figures from a regression model.

The function can handle both individual commands and sequences of commands that are concatenated using the '&&' operator. The '&&' operator is a standard feature in command-line interfaces that allows the execution of multiple commands in sequence, where each subsequent command is only executed if the previous command is successful (i.e., returns a zero exit status). This capability is particularly useful for constructing complex command sequences that require conditional execution based on the success of prior commands.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.This function is designed to execute system-level commands within a Windows operating system environment, utilizing the `os.system()` method from the Python Standard Library. The primary purpose of this function is to facilitate the execution of command-line instructions directly from within a Python script.\n\nThe `os.system()` function is capable of executing both single and multiple commands. When multiple commands need to be executed, they can be chained together using the '&&' operator, which allows for sequential execution. In this context, '&&' ensures that each command is executed only if the preceding command is successful, i.e., it returns a zero exit status. \n\nThis feature is particularly useful for automating tasks that require a series of commands to be executed in a specific order, where the success of later commands depends on the success of earlier ones. For example, you might want to compile a program and then run it only if the compilation step succeeds. The function handles all such scenarios smoothly, provided the commands are syntactically correct and appropriate for the Windows command line.\n\nHere is a simple usage example:\n```python\nimport os\n\n# This will first compile a program and then execute it, only if compilation succeeds.\nos.system(\"gcc my_program.c -o my_program && my_program\")\n```\nIn this example, if the compilation of `my_program.c` is successful, the compiled program `my_program` will be executed. If there is an error in compilation, the execution will not proceed to running the program.\n\nIt is important to note that using `os.system()` is generally considered less secure than other methods, as it can be susceptible to command injection if not managed carefully. Therefore, it is recommended to validate any user input that might be passed to this function.\n\nOverall, this function provides a straightforward interface for integrating command-line operations into Python applications on Windows, leveraging the power of the command line directly within scripts.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.This function is designed to execute system-level commands specifically on Windows operating systems. By leveraging the `os.system()` function from Python's `os` module, it allows the execution of a command string as if it were typed directly into the command prompt. This functionality is highly useful for automating command-line tasks or integrating system commands into Python scripts.\n\nThe function can handle not only individual commands but also multiple commands that are chained together using the '&&' operator. This chaining mechanism is particularly advantageous when you need to execute multiple commands in sequence and want subsequent commands to run only if the preceding ones succeed. For example, if you want to change the directory and then list its contents, you could pass a command string like `cd my_directory && dir` to the function. This ensures that the `dir` command will only execute if the `cd my_directory` command is successful.\n\nAn important detail to note is that because this function utilizes the `os.system()` method, it is synchronous, meaning the Python script will wait for the command to complete before moving on to execute the next line of code. Therefore, it is advisable to be cautious with commands that might take a long time to execute, as they will block further script execution until they are completed.\n\nWhen using this function, it is essential to ensure that the command string is properly formatted and valid within the Windows command-line environment. Incorrect commands or improper syntax could lead to errors or unintended behavior. Additionally, since this function executes commands at the system level, it requires appropriate user permissions to succeed, especially for commands that modify system settings or require elevated privileges.\n\nIn summary, this function serves as a versatile tool for executing Windows command-line instructions from within a Python script, providing flexibility to run single commands or multiple commands in a controlled sequence using '&&'.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

It serves as a convenient way to invoke system commands directly from a Python script.\n\nWhen you have a single command to execute, you can pass it as a single string argument to the function. For instance, if you wanted to execute the command to list directory contents, you could pass \"dir\" to the function and it would perform similarly to entering the command in a Windows command prompt.\n\nFor scenarios where you need to execute multiple commands in sequence, it is important to concatenate these commands into a single string, using '&&' to separate them. The '&&' operator is utilized in command-line operations to execute subsequent commands only if the preceding command is successful. For example, if you need to navigate to a directory and then list the files within that directory, you might provide a command string like \"cd C:\\\\MyFolder && dir\".\n\nHowever, for more intricate tasks that involve a series of commands or require conditional logic, loops, or other complex operations, it is advisable to create a batch file (.bat) containing the necessary commands and logic. You can then execute this batch file through the function, which will, in turn, run the script as if you had executed it manually in the Windows command prompt. This approach is particularly useful for maintaining the readability and organization of your command sequences, as well as for reusing them across different projects or environments.\n\nBy leveraging the capabilities of the `os.system()` function through this approach, you can efficiently integrate system-level operations within your Python applications on Windows, while also keeping your code clean and manageable.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The Windows command line instruction(s) to be executed.

It allows users to filter and narrow down their movie search by specifying certain attributes such as the director, the genre, and members of the cast. By accepting these parameters, the function efficiently searches through a database or a collection of movie records to find matches that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\n- **Director**: Users can input the name of a director to find movies that have been directed by that individual. This parameter is particularly useful for those who wish to explore or revisit the works of a specific director.\n\n- **Genre**: This parameter allows users to specify a genre, facilitating the discovery of movies that belong to a particular category such as action, drama, comedy, or science fiction. Users can thereby tailor their search results to match their current interests or mood.\n\n- **Cast**: By specifying one or more cast members, users can refine their search to include only those movies featuring particular actors or actresses. This is particularly beneficial for fans of certain performers who wish to watch movies in which their favorite stars appear.\n\nThe function processes these parameters to generate a list that includes only those movies that meet all the specified criteria. It is important to note that if any of the parameters are left unspecified, the function will default to ignoring that specific filter, potentially returning a broader range of results. For instance, if only a director is specified, the function will return all movies directed by that person, regardless of genre or cast.\n\nExample usage: \nA user wants to find action movies directed by Christopher Nolan that feature Leonardo DiCaprio. They would specify the director as \"Christopher Nolan,\" the genre as \"action,\" and include \"Leonardo DiCaprio\" in the cast parameter.

It takes a single argument, `query`, which represents the keywords that the user wants to use to find the desired song. These keywords could include the song title, artist name, album, or a combination of these elements.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- `query` (string): This is a required parameter that specifies the search criteria. The function expects a string input that may contain the name of the song, the artist, or any relevant keyword associated with the music track the user wishes to play. The more specific the query, the more accurate the search results will be.\n\n#### Functionality:\n1. **Search Mechanism:** The function initiates a search on the Spotify platform using the provided query. It sends a request to Spotify's search API to retrieve a list of songs that match the given criteria. The search is comprehensive and scans a wide database of music, covering various genres, artists, and albums.\n\n2. **Selection and Playback:** After retrieving the search results, the function selects the most relevant song based on the query. The criteria for selecting the best match could include exact title matches, the popularity of the song, or recency of release. Once the appropriate track is identified, the function sends a command to Spotify to play the song through the user's Spotify account.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- If the query is vague or too broad, the function may return multiple results, and the selection might not always be the user's intended choice.\n- In scenarios where no matches are found for the given query, the function should handle this gracefully, potentially by notifying the user of the issue or suggesting alternative queries.\n- The function assumes that the user is authenticated with Spotify and has an active session for playback to occur.

These parameters are crucial as they determine the availability and pricing of flights, and ensure that the user is booked on the correct flight that matches their travel needs.\n\n- **Departure Location**: This parameter specifies the starting point of the journey. It is typically represented by an airport code or the full name of the airport. Accurate input is necessary to avoid booking a flight from an incorrect location.\n\n- **Date**: This parameter indicates the day on which the user wishes to travel. It is essential to input the date in the correct format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD) to ensure that the system recognizes it correctly. The date must be valid and not in the past, as flights cannot be booked retrospectively.\n\n- **Time**: This parameter specifies the desired departure time for the flight. It should be provided in a 24-hour format (e.g., HH:MM) to prevent any discrepancies. The time must be carefully selected to align with the passenger's schedule and any connecting flights.\n\nThe function processes these inputs to search for available flights that match the specified criteria.

In music theory, a major chord consists of a root note, a major third, and a perfect fifth. This function takes into account the structure of a diatonic scale based on the given key to determine and construct the chord. The input parameter for this function is the musical key, which can be any of the twelve major keys in Western music, such as C major, G major, or D major. Once the key is specified, the function identifies the third degree of the scale and constructs the major chord starting from that note.\n\nFor example, if the key specified is C major, the scale consists of the notes C, D, E, F, G, A, and B. The third scale degree is E, and thus, the third major chord would be E-G#-B. Similarly, if the key is G major, the scale progresses as G, A, B, C, D, E, and F#. The third scale degree in this key is B, leading to the B-D#-F# chord.\n\nIt's important to note that the function assumes the use of standard tuning and equal temperament, which is the common tuning system in Western music.

To achieve this, the function takes two distinct parameters: `rank` and `suit`. The `rank` parameter represents the value of the card, which can vary from numbers such as 2 through 10 to face cards like Jack, Queen, King, and Ace. The second parameter, `suit`, indicates one of the four possible categories: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, or Spades. By providing these parameters, the function systematically searches through the deck to identify and locate the card that exactly matches both the specified rank and suit.\n\nThe function assumes that the input deck is a complete set of 52 playing cards, each uniquely defined by a combination of rank and suit. If the deck is structured as a list or array, the function would iterate over each card, comparing the rank and suit of each card in the deck to the provided parameters. In the case of a successful match, the function would return the position or details of the located card within the deck.

It should be provided as a string or other suitable data type that represents one of the four standard suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, or spades.\n\n#### Calculation\nThe probability is calculated using the following approach:\n1. **Count the Total Number of Cards in the Deck**: First, determine the total number of cards present in the deck, which will be used as the denominator in the probability calculation.\n2. **Count the Number of Cards in the Desired Suit**: Then, count how many cards in the deck belong to the specified suit. This count will form the numerator.\n3. **Compute the Probability**: The probability is computed by dividing the number of cards of the desired suit by the total number of cards in the deck.\n\n#### Formula\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of cards of specified suit}}{\\text{Total number of cards in the deck}} \\]\n\n#### Usage Example\nSuppose you have a standard deck of 52 cards, and you want to calculate the probability of drawing a heart. Assuming the deck is complete and unmodified:\n- Total number of cards (deck) = 52\n- Number of hearts = 13\n\nThe probability would", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"suit": {"type": "string", "description": "The card suit.

The 'exchange rate' parameter is also a numerical value, typically a decimal or a fraction, indicating how much of the target currency can be obtained per unit of the base currency. \n\nThe function multiplies the 'amount in base currency' by the 'exchange rate' to yield the 'current cost in target currency'. This output is the equivalent value in the target currency, reflecting the conversion based on the provided exchange rate.\n\nFor instance, if you have 100 units of the base currency and the exchange rate is 1.2, the function will calculate the current cost in the target currency as 120 units. Similarly, if the exchange rate were 0.75, the calculation would result in 75 units of the target currency for the same 100 units of the base currency. \n\nIt is important to ensure that the exchange rate is up-to-date and accurately reflects market conditions to achieve a precise conversion.

It is an essential tool for applications that require currency exchange and financial computations involving different currencies.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n1. **amount (float):** This parameter represents the monetary value to be converted. It must be a numerical value that can be expressed as a decimal or floating-point number. This ensures precision in currency conversion.\n\n2. **from_currency (str):** A string representing the three-letter ISO 4217 currency code of the currency from which the conversion is being made. Examples include 'USD' for United States Dollar, 'EUR' for Euro, and 'JPY' for Japanese Yen.\n\n3. **to_currency (str):** A string representing the three-letter ISO 4217 currency code of the target currency to which the conversion is desired. Similar to the 'from_currency', it must conform to ISO 4217 standards.\n\n4. **exchange_rate (float):** This parameter is the current or desired exchange rate between the 'from_currency' and the 'to_currency'. It is a multiplier used in the conversion process and should be obtained from a reliable financial data source.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- The function returns a float, which is the equivalent monetary value in the target currency after applying the conversion. It ensures that users receive an accurate financial figure that reflects the current or specified exchange rate.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\n```python\n# Example of converting $100 USD to Euros with an exchange rate of 0.85\nconverted_amount = convert_currency(100.0, 'USD', 'EUR', 0.85)\nprint(converted_amount)  # Outputs: 85.0\n```\n\n**Edge Cases and Considerations:**\n\n- Ensure that the 'amount' is specified as a non-negative number, as negative values may not be valid for certain financial transactions.\n- The function assumes that the 'exchange_rate' is", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"amount": {"type": "integer", "description": "The amount to be converted."}, "from_currency": {"type": "string", "description": "The currency to convert from."}, "to_currency": {"type": "string", "description": "The currency to convert to."}}, "required": ["amount", "from_currency", "to_currency"]}}, {"name": "currency_conversion.convert2", "description": "Convert a value from one currency to another.
