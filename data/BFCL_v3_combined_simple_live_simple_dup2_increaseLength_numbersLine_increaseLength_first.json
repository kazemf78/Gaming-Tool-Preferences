This formula is derived from the basic geometric principle that the area of a triangle is equal to one-half the product of its base and height. \n\n### Parameters:\n\n- **base**: This is a numeric value representing the length of the base of the triangle. It is assumed to be a positive number, as a negative or zero value would not constitute a valid triangle dimension.\n\n- **height**: This is also a numeric value representing the perpendicular height from the base to the opposite vertex of the triangle.

It is important to ensure that both inputs are positive, as negative values or zero would not correspond to a physically meaningful triangle. Furthermore, if either the base or height is provided as a non-numeric type, the function should handle this gracefully, typically by returning an error or a specific message indicating the issue with the input types.\n\n### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose you have a triangle with a base measuring 10 units and a height of 5 units.

The total duration determines how many times the bacteria will have the opportunity to double, thereby affecting the overall evolution rate.\n\nTo put this into context, consider using the function with an example: if you start with 100 bacteria, they double every hour, and the total observation period is 5 hours, the evolution rate will be calculated based on these inputs. The function will compute the number of duplication cycles that occur within the given duration and apply these to the initial count to determine the final bacterial population size.

It is important to ensure that the total number of outcomes is greater than zero to avoid division by zero errors.\n\nThis function can be utilized in a variety of scenarios, such as predicting the likelihood of drawing a specific card from a deck, rolling a particular number on a die, or any other situation where you need to determine the chance of a particular outcome. \n\nFor example, if you want to calculate the probability of drawing an Ace from a standard 52-card deck, you would input 4 as the number of favorable outcomes (since there are 4 Aces in a deck) and 52 as the total number of possible outcomes, resulting in a probability of 4/52 or approximately 0.077.\n\nEdge cases to consider include scenarios where the number of favorable outcomes is zero, resulting in a probability of zero, and cases where the number of favorable outcomes equals the total number of possible outcomes, resulting in a probability of one. Another important consideration is to ensure that the input values are valid; for instance, the number of favorable outcomes should not exceed the total number of outcomes.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"success_outcomes": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of successful outcomes."}, "total_outcomes": {"type": "integer", "description": "The total number of possible outcomes."}, "format_as_ratio": {"type": "boolean", "description": "When true, formats the output as a ratio instead of a decimal.

It is essential to have accurate estimations of these cash flows to ensure an accurate calculation of the NPV.\n\n2. **Discount Rate**: This is a critical parameter in the NPV calculation, representing the rate of return required to make an investment worthwhile. It is used to discount future cash flows back to their present value. The discount rate reflects the opportunity cost of capital, inflation, and the risks associated with the investment. It is typically expressed as a percentage.\n\n3. **Initial Investment**: This is the upfront cost required to undertake the investment. It is usually represented as a negative cash flow at time zero, indicating an outflow of cash.\n\nThe function operates by discounting each future cash flow to its present value using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Present Value} = \\frac{\\text{Future Cash Flow}}{(1 + \\text{Discount Rate})^n} \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the time period. The sum of these present values for all future cash flows is then calculated, and the initial investment is subtracted from this sum to determine the NPV.\n\nA positive NPV indicates that the projected earnings (discounted to the present value) exceed the initial investment cost, signifying a potentially profitable investment. Conversely, a negative NPV suggests that", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"cash_flows": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "integer"}, "description": "Series of future cash flows."}, "discount_rate": {"type": "float", "description": "The discount rate to use."}, "initial_investment": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial investment.

This is achieved by taking two main inputs: the total dividend payout for the quarter and the number of outstanding shares of the company. The total dividend payout refers to the sum of all dividends that the company has distributed to its shareholders for the given quarter. Outstanding shares represent the total number of shares that are currently held by all shareholders, including those held by institutional investors and restricted shares owned by company insiders.\n\nThe calculation process involves dividing the total dividend payout by the total number of outstanding shares. This operation yields the amount of dividend attributed to each individual share for the quarter. It is important to note that this function assumes the total dividend payout is evenly distributed among all shares. This calculation does not account for any special situations such as differing classes of shares, which might have different dividend rights, nor does it consider any dividend reinvestment plans that shareholders might be participating in.\n\nEdge cases that this function should handle include situations where the total dividend payout is zero, resulting in a zero dividend per share, or when there are no outstanding shares, which would be an exceptional case requiring error handling to avoid division by zero. Additionally, if the input values are very large, the function should ensure that it can handle the required arithmetic operations without overflow errors.\n\nFor example, if a company has declared a total dividend payout of $2,000,000 for the quarter, and there are 1,000,000 outstanding shares, the quarterly dividend per share would be calculated as follows: $2,000,000 divided by 1,000,000, resulting in a dividend of $2.00 per share.

The calculation is based on three critical parameters: the distance traveled by the vehicle over the course of a year, the type of fuel used by the vehicle, and the vehicle's fuel efficiency. \n\n1. **Distance Traveled:** This parameter represents the total distance that the vehicle covers in a year, typically measured in kilometers or miles. It is an essential factor because the amount of CO2 emissions is directly proportional to how far the vehicle travels. The greater the distance, the more emissions are expected, provided other factors remain constant.\n\n2. **Fuel Type:** This refers to the kind of fuel the vehicle uses, such as gasoline, diesel, or alternative fuels like ethanol or natural gas. Each fuel type has a specific carbon content, and the emissions calculation will vary depending on the carbon intensity associated with the combustion of that particular fuel. For instance, gasoline and diesel have different emission factors, affecting the total CO2 emissions calculated.\n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency:** This parameter indicates how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel to travel a given distance, typically stated in terms of liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km) or miles per gallon (mpg). Higher fuel efficiency means that the vehicle consumes less fuel for the same distance, resulting in lower CO2 emissions. Conversely, lower efficiency leads to higher emissions.\n\nThe function combines these parameters to estimate the total CO2 emissions for the year.

The input synaptic rate represents the frequency or intensity of incoming signals that the neuron receives. It is a significant factor because a higher synaptic rate typically leads to increased neuronal activity. The weight of inputs is another essential factor that influences the firing rate.

Adjusting the lightness can be essential for matching specific design requirements or achieving a desired visual effect. This adjustment is typically done using a parameter provided by the user, which allows control over how much lighter or darker the final color should appear. The manipulation of lightness might utilize color models such as HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) to ensure accurate and consistent changes.\n\nIt is worth noting that the combination of certain primary colors may result in secondary colors, such as mixing blue and yellow to obtain green, or red and blue to create purple. The function must be designed to handle all combinations of primary colors and provide a predictable output. Additionally, the lightness adjustment should be able to handle edge cases, such as when the color is at its darkest or lightest possible state, ensuring that the adjustments remain within a valid range.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nTo illustrate, suppose you want to use this function to mix red and blue, and then lighten the resulting color:\n\n```python\nresult_color = combine_and_adjust_colors('red', 'blue', lightness_adjustment=0.2)\n```\n\nIn this example, the function mixes red and", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"color1": {"type": "string", "description": "The first primary color to be mixed."}, "color2": {"type": "string", "description": "The second primary color to be mixed."}, "lightness": {"type": "integer", "description": "The desired lightness level of the resulting color in percentage.

When both dice are rolled together, they produce a combined result that can range from a minimum sum of 2 (if both dice show a 1) to a maximum sum of 12 (if both dice show a 6). This function is particularly useful in games such as Monopoly, where players' movements on the board are determined by the outcome of rolling two dice.\n\nThe calculation takes into account all possible combinations of dice rolls that can result in the desired sum. For instance, to achieve a sum of 7, there are several possible roll combinations: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), and (6,1), making it the most probable outcome. The function will iterate through all pairs of values that the dice can produce to determine how many of these combinations add up to the target sum.\n\nThe probability is computed by dividing the number of successful outcomes (combinations that result in the target sum) by the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice, which is 36 (since each die has 6 faces and 6 x 6 = 36).

It begins by taking a complete deck consisting of the four traditional suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades, each containing thirteen cards ranging from Ace through King. The deck, therefore, contains 52 unique cards in total.\n\nThe primary operation performed by this function is shuffling, which randomizes the order of the cards within the deck to ensure a fair draw. This step is crucial for any applications where unpredictability and randomness are desired, such as in card games or simulations.\n\nOnce the deck is sufficiently shuffled, the function proceeds to draw cards. The number of cards to be drawn is specified as an input parameter. For example, if the parameter value is set to 5, the function will draw the top five cards from the shuffled deck. This parameter allows flexibility in usage, accommodating varying requirements for different card games or experiments. \n\nIt's important to note that the function assumes the number of cards requested does not exceed the total number of cards in the deck. If a value larger than 52 is provided, it may result in an error or require additional handling to manage such cases appropriately. The drawn cards are typically returned in the order they were drawn, maintaining the sequence as they appeared from the top of the shuffled deck.\n\nIn terms of usage, this function can be particularly useful in gaming applications where a deck needs to be shuffled and a specific number of cards dealt to players. It can also be employed in simulations or educational tools that require random card selection from a deck.

A full house is a hand that contains three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank, such as three queens and two eights. In a standard deck of 52 playing cards, this is considered one of the stronger hands a player can have.\n\n#### Features and Details:\n\n- **Input Parameters:** The function typically does not require input parameters, as it operates on the assumption of a standard 52-card deck used in typical poker games.\n  \n- **Output:** The output is a numerical probability value, representing the likelihood of being dealt a full house. This value ranges between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating certainty. The probability is calculated by considering all possible five-card combinations that form a full house and dividing by the total number of possible five-card hands.\n\n- **Calculation Methodology:** \n  - The method involves combinatorial mathematics to determine the number of successful outcomes (i.e., the number of ways to form a full house) divided by the total number of possible five-card hands from a deck. \n  - Specifically, it calculates the combinations of choosing three cards of the same rank from four available in the deck, and two cards of another rank from the remaining four cards of that rank.\n\n- **Edge Cases:** \n  - The function assumes a perfect shuffle and no prior card removal, reflecting a fresh and complete deck.\n  - It does not account for multiple decks or jokers, as it is based on the standard poker rules using a single deck.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nThe function can be used in poker simulation games, strategy analysis, or as part of a larger poker hand evaluation library.

For numbers, it returns the negative value.This function is designed to reverse or invert various types of input data, returning a transformed output based on the input's data type. The function can handle strings, booleans, and numbers, each with a specific inversion operation:\n\n1. **String Reversal**: When the input is a string, the function processes the string by reversing the sequence of its characters. For example, if the input string is \"hello\", the function returns \"olleh\". This operation ensures that the order of the characters is completely flipped from the end to the beginning, resulting in a mirror image of the original string.\n\n2. **Boolean Negation**: If the input is a boolean value, the function performs a logical negation. This means that if the input is `True`, the function returns `False`, and if the input is `False`, it returns `True`. This process effectively inverts the truth value of the boolean input, providing the logical opposite.\n\n3. **Numeric Negation**: When the input is a number, the function calculates its negative value. For instance, if the input is a positive number like `25`, the function returns `-25`. Conversely, if the input is already negative, such as `-13`, the function will return `13`. This operation changes the sign of the number, making positive numbers negative and negative numbers positive.\n\n**Usage Examples**:\n\n- For a string input `reverse(\"world\")`, the output would be `\"dlrow\"`.\n- For a boolean input `reverse(True)`, the result would be `False`.\n- For a numeric input `reverse(42)`, the output would be `-42`.\n\nThis function allows for versatile handling of data types, performing appropriate inversion operations depending on whether the input is a string, boolean, or number.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["input_value"], "properties": {"input_value": {"type": "any", "description": "The value to be reversed.

The `os.system()` function is a simple way to run commands as if they were being executed directly in the command line interface or Command Prompt on a Windows machine. One of the key features of this functionality is its capability to handle not only individual commands but also to execute multiple commands that are linked or chained together using the `&&` operator. This operator serves as a conditional execution mechanism: if the command preceding the `&&` operator completes successfully, the subsequent command will be executed. This allows the user to create a sequence of commands that depend on the successful execution of the previous ones, effectively enabling more complex operations to be performed in a single call to the function. \n\nFor instance, if a user wishes to navigate to a specific directory and then list its contents, they might chain these commands as follows: `cd my_directory && dir`.

Additionally, special attention should be given to the use of special characters and spaces, which may need to be appropriately escaped or quoted to ensure they are interpreted correctly by the shell.\n\nFor example, a single command execution might look like:\n```python\nos.system('dir')\n```\nThis command would display a list of files and directories in the current directory.\n\nFor multiple commands chained together, such as:\n```python\nos.system('cd folder_name && dir')\n```\nHere, the function first attempts to change the directory to `folder_name`, and if successful, it proceeds to list the files and directories within the specified folder. If the `cd` command fails, the `dir` command does not execute. \n\nBear in mind that `os.system()` opens a subshell to run the command, and the function is blocking, meaning it will wait for the command to complete before moving on to the next line of code in the script. This behavior can be beneficial when commands must run in order, but it may not be suitable", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

In the case of multiple commands, the chaining with '&&' ensures that each command executes sequentially, and execution of subsequent commands only proceeds if the preceding command completes successfully without errors. An example of multiple command execution could be `mkdir new_folder && cd new_folder && echo File Created > file.txt`, which first creates a new directory, then navigates into it, and finally creates a new text file with the specified content.\n\nThe function returns an exit status code, which is the encoded value from the subprocess, indicating success or failure of the command execution.

For multiple commands, separate them with '&&'. For complex tasks, create and run a .bat file.This function is designed to execute a specified command or sequence of commands on a Windows operating system by utilizing the `os.system()` function from Python's standard `os` module. The `os.system()` function is a simple way to execute shell commands directly from within a Python script. When you need to execute multiple commands in a single call, you can concatenate these commands by using the '&&' operator. The '&&' operator allows commands to be executed sequentially, where the subsequent command is executed only if the preceding command is successful. This approach is useful for straightforward command executions that do not require intricate logic or heavy scripting.\n\nHowever, for executing more advanced or complex tasks that involve conditional operations, loops, or require maintaining state between commands, it's recommended to create a separate batch file (with a `.bat` extension). A batch file can contain a series of commands and is executed by the command-line interpreter on Windows. You can write all your complex logic into this batch file and then run it through the `os.system()` function by executing the batch file itself.\n\nNote that while using `os.system()`, it's important to remember that it passes the command to the Windows command line, and the output is directed to the standard output stream of the Python environment. This function is synchronous, meaning it will wait for the command to complete, which can block the execution of your script until the command finishes.

This identifier is crucial for distinguishing the service from similar services, especially when multiple services of the same type exist. The retrieval process is performed based on two primary criteria: the service type and the location, specifically within a designated province.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **Service Type:** \n   - This parameter specifies the category or classification of the service you are attempting to identify. \n   - It is important that the service type is accurately provided, as it directly influences the identification process.\n   - Examples of service types could include utilities, healthcare, education, transportation, etc.\n\n2. **Location (Province):**\n   - The location parameter refers to the specific geographical area where the service is offered, limited to a province level.\n   - The province acts as a boundary for the search, ensuring that the function narrows down the identifier to services available within the specified province.\n   - This is particularly relevant in regions where administrative divisions significantly influence service delivery.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- If the service type provided does not exist within the specified province, the function should be designed to handle such scenarios gracefully, possibly by returning a null or error message indicating that no matching service was found.\n- In cases where multiple services of the same type exist within the province, additional logic may be required to ensure the correct unique identifier is retrieved. This could involve prioritizing services based on additional criteria not covered by this function.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nImagine a scenario where you need to retrieve the unique identifier for a healthcare service in the province of Alberta. By specifying the service type as \"healthcare\" and the location as \"Alberta,\" the function will search through the available records and return the unique identifier for the healthcare service specifically associated with that province. This identifier can then be used for further operations such as updating service details, tracking usage, or integrating with other provincial databases.\n\nIn summary, this function plays a critical role in", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["service_id"], "properties": {"service_id": {"type": "integer", "description": "The unique identifier of the service.

The primary criteria for filtering service providers include the type of service being sought and the geographical location where the service is required. By specifying the service type, users can narrow down their search to providers who offer the particular service they need, such as plumbing, electrical work, or landscaping. Additionally, by including location criteria, users can further refine the list to include only those service providers who operate within a desired area, ensuring that the results are relevant and accessible. This function is particularly useful for users who need to find suitable service providers quickly and efficiently, based on their specific needs and geographical preferences.\n\n### Parameters:\n\n- **service_type (str):** This parameter specifies the category or type of service required. It is a string that indicates the nature of the service being sought, allowing the function to filter the service providers accordingly. For example, valid inputs might include \"plumbing\", \"house cleaning\", or \"automotive repair\".\n\n- **location (str):** This parameter defines the geographical area where the service is needed. It is a string that can represent a city, town, zip code, or any other location identifier.
