If optional 'root_type' is 'real', the function will only return real roots. If not specified, function may return complex roots.The function is designed to solve a quadratic equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where 'a', 'b', and 'c' are coefficients supplied as inputs. This function efficiently calculates the roots of the quadratic equation by applying the quadratic formula: x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a). It is important to note that the coefficient 'a' must not be zero, as the equation would then not be quadratic.\n\nAn optional parameter, 'root_type', can be specified to control the nature of the roots returned by the function. This parameter accepts only one value: 'real'. When 'root_type' is set to 'real', the function is restricted to returning only the real roots of the equation. This is particularly useful in cases where the application requires non-complex solutions, such as in certain engineering or physics problems.\n\nIf the 'root_type' parameter is not specified, the function defaults to returning both real and complex roots. In mathematical terms, complex roots are considered when the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative, yielding an imaginary component in the solution.\n\nFor example, if the function is called with coefficients a=1, b=2, c=1, and no 'root_type' specified, it will return the root -1, as the discriminant b\u00b2 - 4ac equals 0, indicating a single real root. However, if the function is called with coefficients a=1, b=1, c=1 and without the 'root_type' specified, it will return complex roots due to a negative discriminant.\n\nIn summary, this function provides flexibility in solving quadratic equations by allowing users to specify the desired type of roots, catering to both general and specific use cases involving real and complex solutions.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"a": {"type": "integer", "description": "The coefficient of the squared term in the quadratic equation."}, "b": {"type": "integer", "description": "The coefficient of the linear term in the quadratic equation."}, "c": {"type": "integer", "description": "The constant term in the quadratic equation."}, "root_type": {"type": "string", "description": "The type of roots to return: 'real' for real roots, 'all' for both real and complex roots.

It returns the string directly if an answer is found within it. Should the output indicate that no answer was found, an empty string is returned instead.The function is designed to thoroughly examine the output generated by a language model, which typically processes input data and generates textual responses. The primary purpose of this function is to determine whether the output string contains a valid answer to the query or task initially posed to the language model. If the analysis confirms the presence of an answer within the text, the function will return the string as it is, without any modification.

The calculation is based on two primary variables: the temperature of the air and its volume. In thermodynamics, the heat capacity at constant pressure is an essential property that indicates how much heat a substance can absorb before changing its temperature. \n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **Temperature (T):** The temperature of the air, typically measured in degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) or Kelvin (K). It is crucial to ensure that the temperature is within a valid range for air, as extreme conditions may affect the accuracy of the calculation. \n\n- **Volume (V):** The volume of air under consideration, usually expressed in cubic meters (m\u00b3). Accurate measurement of volume is essential, as it directly influences the heat capacity. \n\n#### Return Value:\n\nThe function returns the heat capacity of the air at constant pressure, typically expressed in units of energy per temperature change, such as joules per Kelvin (J/K).\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose you have a sample of air at a temperature of 300 K and a volume of 2 m\u00b3. By passing these values as arguments to the function, it calculates the heat capacity of this air sample at constant pressure, providing insights into how much energy would be needed to increase the temperature of this specific volume of air by one degree Kelvin. \n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Extreme Temperatures:** The function may not account for very high or low temperatures where air might change its state (e.g., transitioning into liquid).\n  \n- **Volume Considerations:** The function expects a realistic, positive volume value. Inputting zero or negative values may lead to incorrect calculations or errors.\n\n#### Additional Notes:\n\nUnderstanding the heat capacity at constant pressure is particularly useful in various engineering applications, including HVAC system design and atmospheric science studies, where precise control of temperature and energy transfer is required.

It bases its prediction on the individual's physical measurements, specifically their weight and height.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **Weight**: The weight of the person expressed in kilograms (kg). It is crucial to ensure that the weight is accurate as it significantly influences the likelihood calculation.\n  \n- **Height**: The height of the person provided in meters (m). Accurate measurement is important for reliable predictions.\n\n#### Functionality:\nThe function utilizes weight and height to calculate the body mass index (BMI) of the individual. BMI is a well-known indicator used in medical fields to assess whether an individual falls within a healthy weight range. Since excess body weight is a known risk factor for type 2 diabetes, the BMI result is a critical factor in predicting diabetes likelihood.\n\nThe function applies a statistical model based on existing medical research data to evaluate how these measurements correlate with the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

It serves as a tool for organizing and categorizing customer interactions based on predefined classification criteria or categories, enabling better handling and analysis of customer service data.\n\n#### Functionality\n- **Purpose**: The primary goal of this function is to ensure that each customer query is associated with an appropriate classification. This process is crucial for maintaining an organized database of customer interactions, facilitating efficient query handling, and enabling data-driven insights into customer service performance.\n\n- **Input**: The function typically takes specific parameters that include the details of the customer service query. This can include information such as the query ID, customer details, and the classification category, which may be predetermined by an automated system or a customer service agent.\n\n- **Process**: Upon receiving the necessary input parameters, the function records the classification in a centralized system. This might involve updating a database or a CRM system with the classification details, ensuring that the query is stored under the correct category.\n\n- **Output**: The function does not necessarily return a value but ensures that the classification is stored correctly. Success or failure in recording the classification might be logged or signaled through a status message or a boolean indicator.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n- **Invalid Classification**: If a query is attempted to be classified into a category that does not exist or is invalid, the function should handle this gracefully, possibly by returning an error message or logging the incident for further investigation.\n\n- **Duplicate Queries**: In cases where the same customer query is attempted to be classified multiple times, the function should check for duplicates to prevent redundant data entries.\n\n- **Data Integrity**: The function must ensure the integrity and accuracy of the classification data, avoiding situations where queries are misclassified due to incorrect input parameters.\n\n#### Usage Example\nConsider a scenario where a customer service department receives a query related to billing issues.

The intent names act as identifiers that help group the queries into relevant categories for easier retrieval and analysis.\n\nWhen using this function, you will pass the queries as keyword arguments, with each keyword representing an intent name and its corresponding value being the query that matches that intent.

The function would then categorize each query under these intent names, ensuring that all queries with the same intent are grouped together. This categorization aids in the organization of queries, making it easier to perform subsequent operations such as analysis or retrieval based on specific intents.\n\nThis functionality is particularly useful in applications involving natural language processing, where understanding the intent behind user queries is crucial.

It should be a string input that precisely matches the registered company name of the customer in the database. It serves as the key identifier for the search operation, enabling the function to locate and compile all the associated tickets.\n\n#### Output\n\n- **List of Tickets:** The function returns a list containing all the tickets that are tied to the specified company. Each ticket in the list includes detailed information such as the ticket ID, date of issue, status, description of the issue, and any other relevant data that can assist in understanding and resolving the customer's request.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n\n- **Non-Existent Company Name:** If the company name provided does not exist in the system's database, the function will return an empty list, indicating that there are no tickets associated with such a company name.\n  \n- **Multiple Companies with Similar Names:** In situations where there are companies with similar names, the function relies on the exact match of the provided string to ensure accurate retrieval. It is critical for the user to input the exact company name to avoid fetching incorrect or incomplete ticket data.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\nSuppose a customer service representative wants to view all tickets for a company named \"Tech Innovators.\" They would call the function providing \"Tech Innovators\" as the company name.

Common compounding frequencies include annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, or daily.\n- **Time (t)**: The total time the money is invested or borrowed for, usually expressed in years.\n\nThe formula used for calculating compound interest is:\n\\[ A = P \\times \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt} \\]\nwhere \\( A \\) is the future value of the investment/loan, including interest.\n\nThe function effectively computes the future value \\( A \\) based on the parameters provided and subtracts the initial principal to derive the compound interest earned or owed.\n\nEdge cases to consider include:\n- If the interest rate is zero, the compound interest will be zero regardless of the principal or time period.\n- If the number of compounding periods per year is one, the formula reduces to annual compounding.\n- A negative interest rate could be considered in scenarios like certain economic conditions, leading to a decrease in the investment rather than an increase.\n\nExample usage:\nAssuming an initial investment of $1,000, an annual interest rate of 5% compounded monthly, and a time period of 10 years, the function call would look like this:\n```python\ncalculate_compound_interest(1000,", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"principal": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial amount of money that was invested or loaned out."}, "annual_rate": {"type": "float", "description": "The interest rate for a year as a percentage."}, "compounding_freq": {"type": "string", "enum": ["monthly", "quarterly", "annually"], "description": "The number of times that interest is compounded per unit period."}, "time_in_years": {"type": "integer", "description": "The time the money is invested for in years."}}, "required": ["principal", "annual_rate", "compounding_freq", "time_in_years"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"compound_interest1": {"principal": 10000, "annual_rate": 0.05, "compounding_freq": "monthly", "time_in_years": 5}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"compound_interest1": {"principal": 10000, "annual_rate": 0.05, "compounding_freq": "monthly", "time_in_years": 5}}], "possible_answer": [{"compound_interest1": {"principal": [10000], "annual_rate": [5.0], "compounding_freq": ["monthly"], "time_in_years": [5]}}, {"compound_interest2": {"principal": [10000], "annual_rate": [5.0], "compounding_freq": ["monthly"], "time_in_years": [5]}}, {"compound_interest3": {"principal": [10000], "annual_rate": [5.0], "compounding_freq": ["monthly"], "time_in_years": [5]}}]}

This value is crucial as it sets the baseline for all future growth calculations. The annual growth rate is expressed as a percentage, signifying the expected increase in the value of the investment for each year it is held. This rate is assumed to be constant throughout the holding period, which implies that the growth is compounded annually.\n\nThe holding period refers to the duration, measured in years, for which the investment is held before the returns are calculated. It is important to note that this function assumes that the annual growth rate remains consistent over the entire holding period, enabling the application of compound interest calculations to determine the final projected return.\n\nThe formula used to calculate the projected return is based on the principle of compound interest, given by the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Projected Return} = \\text{Investment Amount} \\times (1 + \\frac{\\text{Annual Growth Rate}}{100})^{\\text{Holding Period}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- The Investment Amount is the initial sum of money invested.\n- The Annual Growth Rate is divided by 100 to convert the percentage into a decimal for calculation purposes.\n- The Holding Period is the number of years the money is invested.\n\nAn example of usage for this function could be as follows: if an investor places $10,000 into a stock with an anticipated annual growth rate of 5% and plans to hold the investment for 10 years, the function will calculate the projected return by plugging these values into the formula, resulting in a future value of approximately $16,288.95.\n\nIt is important for users of this function to ensure the accuracy of their inputs, particularly the investment amount and growth rate, as any errors in these values", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"investment_amount": {"type": "integer", "description": "The amount of money to invest."}, "annual_growth_rate": {"type": "float", "description": "The expected annual growth rate of the stock."}, "holding_period": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of years you intend to hold the stock."}, "dividends": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Optional.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.The function is designed to execute system-level commands specifically within the context of Windows operating systems, utilizing the `os.system()` method provided by Python's standard library. This method enables interaction with the underlying operating system by sending commands directly to the system shell, allowing for a wide range of operations such as file manipulation, program execution, or system configuration changes.\n\nOne key feature of this function is its ability to execute not just a single command, but also multiple commands in sequence. This is achieved through the use of '&&', a logical operator that allows commands to be chained together. When commands are chained using '&&', each command is executed only if the preceding command was successful, i.e., it returned a zero exit status. This ensures that subsequent commands are only executed if previous commands have not encountered any errors, providing a simple error handling mechanism.\n\nFor example, if you need to change directories and then list files within that directory, you could use the function to execute a command string like \"cd C:\\ExampleDirectory && dir\". If the directory change is successful, the directory listing will proceed; otherwise, if the 'cd' command fails, the 'dir' command will not execute.\n\nIt is important to note that since this function relies on the `os.system()` call, it inherits certain limitations and behaviors of this method. For instance, `os.system()` is a blocking call, meaning that the program will wait until the command has completed execution before proceeding. Additionally, it returns the exit status of the command executed, where a return value of zero typically indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates an error.\n\nFurthermore, because it interacts with the system shell, any command passed to this function must be formatted correctly according to shell syntax and must be something that the system shell can interpret and execute.

For instance, you might want to navigate to a specific directory and then list its contents: `os.system(\"cd C:\\\\SomeDirectory && dir\")`.\n\nIt is important to note that, because this function relies on the underlying system shell, it is limited to the commands and syntax that are supported by the Windows command prompt. Additionally, the function will block the calling Python script until the executed command has completed. The return value of `os.system()` is the exit status of the command, where a return value of zero typically indicates success, while a non-zero value signals an error. Therefore, when using this function, it is advisable to handle potential errors appropriately.\n\nIn summary, this function is a simple and effective way to integrate direct command-line instructions into a Python script when working within a Windows environment.

This function is capable of executing not only individual commands but also allowing for the execution of multiple commands that can be linked or combined using the logical AND operator, represented by '&&'. This chaining of commands means that the subsequent command will only be executed if the preceding command completes successfully, without error. It is important to note that the `os.system()` function sends the specified command(s) to the command interpreter, which on Windows is typically `cmd.exe`, for execution. This function is generally used for simple command execution and does not provide access to the input, output, or error streams of the command. \n\nAs an example, if you want to create a directory and then navigate into it only if the directory creation was successful, you could use the function to execute the command string `mkdir new_folder && cd new_folder`. Here, `mkdir new_folder` will attempt to create a directory named `new_folder`, and if this operation is successful, `cd new_folder` will change the current directory to `new_folder`.\n\nWhen utilizing this function, it is also crucial to consider security implications, especially if the command string is constructed from external input, as this could lead to command injection vulnerabilities. Proper input validation and sanitization should be performed to mitigate such risks.

The `os.system()` function is a straightforward way to run commands as if they were being executed directly in the command prompt of Windows. This can include a wide range of operations, from simple directory listings to more complex command scripts.\n\nA notable feature of this function is its ability to handle multiple commands at once. This is achieved by chaining commands together using the '&&' operator. In the context of command execution, the '&&' operator allows users to run several commands in sequence. The subsequent command will only execute if the preceding command is successful, meaning it returns a zero exit status. This feature is particularly useful for executing a series of dependent commands where the success of one command is required for the next to proceed.\n\nFor example, a user can execute a command string such as `\"dir && echo 'Listed directories'\"`. In this case, the `dir` command will list the contents of the current directory.

This array contains multiple entries, each representing a person, and the function processes this data according to a predefined schema. This schema outlines the expected structure and types of information for each entry, specifically focusing on three key elements: age, name, and an optional nickname associated with the individual.\n\n1. **Age**: This field captures the numerical representation of a person's age. It is a mandatory data point within the schema and must be a valid integer. The function assumes that the age is provided directly in the data array and performs the necessary extraction to return this information accurately.\n\n2. **Name**: This element of the schema refers to the person's full name. It is a required field and is expected to be provided as a string in the data array. The function identifies and retrieves the name for each person, ensuring it aligns with the expected schema format.\n\n3. **Optional Nickname**: Unlike age and name, the nickname is an optional component of the schema. This means that while it can be present, it is not required. If included, the nickname is also represented as a string. The function is designed to handle cases where a nickname might be absent, ensuring it does not disrupt the extraction process for the other required fields.\n\nEdge cases that the function handles might include entries where the optional nickname is missing, or variations in the data array's structure that still conform to the schema.

This calculation is essential for understanding the environmental impact of a vehicle's operation over the course of a year. The function takes into account three primary factors to determine these emissions: the distance traveled by the vehicle, the type of fuel that the vehicle uses, and the fuel efficiency of the vehicle.\n\n1. **Distance Traveled**: This parameter represents the total number of miles or kilometers that the vehicle covers in a year. It is a crucial factor because the more a vehicle is driven, the more fuel it consumes, and consequently, the more emissions it produces.\n\n2. **Fuel Type**: The type of fuel used by the vehicle plays a significant role in the calculation. Different fuels have varying carbon content and therefore produce different amounts of carbon dioxide when burned. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, and alternative fuels like natural gas or electricity. Each of these fuels has a specific carbon dioxide emission factor, which is used in the calculation to ensure accurate results.\n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency**: Also known as fuel economy, this parameter measures how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel to cover a distance. It is typically expressed in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). A vehicle with higher fuel efficiency will consume less fuel over the same distance compared to a less efficient vehicle, thereby producing fewer emissions.\n\nThe function combines these parameters in a formula to determine the total annual carbon dioxide emissions for the vehicle. It is important to input accurate values for each parameter to ensure the validity of the calculation. This information can be beneficial for vehicle owners seeking to reduce their carbon footprint by understanding the emissions associated with their driving habits and vehicle characteristics.\n\n**Example Usage**:\n- A user can input the following: a vehicle that travels 15,000 miles annually, runs on gasoline, and has a fuel efficiency of 25 MPG.

Users can input the name of a director to find movies directed by that individual, specify a particular genre to narrow down the list to their preferred type of film, or list one or more actors to include movies featuring those performers. \n\nThe function accepts three parameters: \n1. **Director**: This parameter allows users to input the name of a director. The function will search for and return movies that have been directed by the specified individual. It should be noted that if no director is specified, this filter will not be applied.\n2. **Genre**: Users can specify a genre, such as \"Action\", \"Comedy\", or \"Drama\", to filter the movies to those that belong to this category. If the genre is left unspecified, the function will not restrict the results by genre.\n3. **Cast**: This parameter can include one or multiple actor names. The function will return movies that feature any of the specified actors. If no cast members are indicated, this filter will be ignored.\n\nThe function is flexible in its application, allowing users to apply any combination of these parameters or use them independently. For example, users can retrieve movies solely by a specific director without considering genre or cast, or they can search for movies within a particular genre that include a certain cast member, even if the director field is left empty.\n\nEdge cases to consider include scenarios where none of the parameters are provided, in which case the function may return an error or a complete list of all available movies, depending on the system's configuration.
