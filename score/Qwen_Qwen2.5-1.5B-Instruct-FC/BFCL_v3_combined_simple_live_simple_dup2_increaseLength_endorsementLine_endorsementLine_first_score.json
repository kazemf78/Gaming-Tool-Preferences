If optional 'root_type' is 'real', the function will only return real roots. If not specified, function may return complex roots.The function is designed to solve a quadratic equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where 'a', 'b', and 'c' are the coefficients provided as inputs to the function. The coefficients are crucial in determining the nature of the roots of the quadratic equation. The parameter 'a' should not be zero, as that would make the equation linear rather than quadratic.\n\nThe function also accepts an optional parameter, 'root_type', which can be used to specify the type of roots desired in the output. If the 'root_type' is set to 'real', the function is constrained to return only the real roots of the quadratic equation. In this scenario, if the equation does not have real roots, the function may return an indication that no real roots exist, such as an empty array or a specific error message.\n\nOn the other hand, if the 'root_type' is not specified or is set to a value other than 'real', the function has the flexibility to return complex roots. In this case, the function is capable of providing solutions involving complex numbers, which occur when the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is less than zero. The solutions will be in the form of complex numbers, which include both real and imaginary parts.\n\nThis function is valuable in applications where the nature of the roots is important, such as in physics and engineering, where real solutions are often required, or in mathematical contexts where complex solutions are necessary. It is important for users to appropriately specify the 'root_type' parameter based on their specific needs to ensure they receive the correct type of solution. \n\nExample usage includes:\n- `solve_quadratic(1, -3, 2)` which might return [2, 1] for real roots.\n- `solve_quadratic(1, 2, 5, root_type='real')` which could return an indication of no real roots.\n- `solve_quadratic(1", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"a": {"type": "integer", "description": "The coefficient of the squared term in the quadratic equation."}, "b": {"type": "integer", "description": "The coefficient of the linear term in the quadratic equation."}, "c": {"type": "integer", "description": "The constant term in the quadratic equation."}, "root_type": {"type": "string", "description": "The type of roots to return: 'real' for real roots, 'all' for both real and complex roots.

This parameter significantly influences the heat capacity, as the physical properties of air, including its specific heat capacity, can vary with temperature changes.\n\n2. **Volume (V)**:\n   - **Type**: Usually given in cubic meters (m\u00b3), but any volume unit can be used as long as it's consistent throughout calculations.\n   - **Description**: The volume of the air sample under consideration. While volume plays a lesser role compared to temperature in this calculation, it's still an essential factor in the context of the overall thermodynamic state of the gas.\n\n#### Function Usage:\n\nThis function is particularly useful in situations where precise control of thermal conditions is required, such as in air conditioning systems, combustion engines, and atmospheric studies. By calculating the heat capacity at constant pressure, engineers and scientists can predict how air will react under various thermal loads, facilitating more efficient system designs and energy use.\n\n#### Edge Cases and Considerations:\n\n- **Non-Standard Conditions**: Ensure that input parameters are within the standard operating range for air. Extreme temperatures or pressures may necessitate adjustments or alternative approaches.\n- **Ideal Gas Assumption**: This calculation generally assumes that air behaves as an ideal gas. Deviations from this behavior may occur at high pressures or low temperatures,", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The temperature of the gas in Kelvin."}, "volume": {"type": "integer", "description": "The volume of the gas in m^3."}, "gas": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of gas, with 'air' as default."}}, "required": ["temp", "volume"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"calc_heat_capacity1": {"temp": 298, "volume": 1000, "gas": "air"}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"calc_heat_capacity1": {"temp": 298, "volume": 1000, "gas": "air"}}], "possible_answer": [{"calc_heat_capacity1": {"temp": [298], "volume": [10], "gas": ["air", ""]}}, {"calc_heat_capacity2": {"temp": [298], "volume": [10], "gas": ["air", ""]}}, {"calc_heat_capacity3": {"temp": [298], "volume": [10], "gas": ["air", ""]}}]}

It takes into account the yearly yield of the fund, the amount of money invested, and the duration over which the investment is held. By synthesizing these elements, the function provides an estimate of the potential financial return.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **Yearly Yield**: This parameter represents the annual percentage rate at which the mutual fund is expected to grow. It is typically expressed as a percentage. The yearly yield should reflect realistic market conditions and mutual fund performance metrics. For example, a yearly yield of 5% would be input as 0.05.\n\n2. **Investment Amount**: This parameter details the total sum of money that is initially invested into the mutual fund. It is crucial for determining the base from which returns are calculated. The investment amount should be a positive numerical value representing the amount in currency units (e.g., dollars, euros).\n\n3. **Time Period**: This parameter indicates the duration for which the investment is held. The time period is usually expressed in years and should be a positive integer or a decimal value. For instance, an investment period of 5 years could be entered as 5 or 5.0.\n\n#### Calculation Process:\n\nThe function employs the formula for calculating compound interest, adjusted for mutual funds. The estimated return is derived by applying the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Estimated Return} = \\text{Investment Amount} \\times (1 + \\text{Yearly Yield})^{\\text{Time Period}} \\]\n\nThis calculation assumes that the yield is compounded annually, meaning the investment grows at the yearly yield rate each year over the specified time period.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- If the yearly yield is 0, the function should return the original investment amount, as no growth would occur without yield.\n- Negative values for the yearly yield are generally not expected and", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"yearly_yield": {"type": "float", "description": "The yearly yield of the mutual fund as a percentage."}, "investment_amount": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial investment amount in the mutual fund."}, "years": {"type": "integer", "description": "The time period for which the investment is made in years."}}, "required": ["yearly_yield", "investment_amount", "years"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"estimate_mutual_fund_return1": {"yearly_yield": 0.05, "investment_amount": 2000, "years": 3}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"estimate_mutual_fund_return1": {"yearly_yield": 0.05, "investment_amount": 2000, "years": 3}}], "possible_answer": [{"estimate_mutual_fund_return1": {"yearly_yield": [5.0], "investment_amount": [2000], "years": [3]}}, {"estimate_mutual_fund_return2": {"yearly_yield": [5.0], "investment_amount": [2000], "years": [3]}}, {"estimate_mutual_fund_return3": {"yearly_yield": [5.0], "investment_amount": [2000], "years": [3]}}]}

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.This function is designed to execute system-level commands specifically on Windows operating systems by utilizing the `os.system()` method provided by Python. The `os.system()` function is a part of the `os` module, which is used to interact with the operating system. This function allows users to run commands that would typically be executed in the command prompt, enabling automation of various tasks directly from a Python script.\n\nThe function can execute not just a single command but also multiple commands, which can be chained together using the '&&' operator. In the context of command-line operations, the '&&' operator is used to concatenate commands, ensuring that the subsequent command is executed only if the preceding command completes successfully. This chaining mechanism provides a powerful way to perform a sequence of operations, checking the success of each step before proceeding to the next.\n\nFor example, if you want to navigate to a directory and then list the files within it, you could use the following command string: `\"cd path/to/directory && dir\"`. Here, `cd` changes the current directory, and `dir` lists the contents of that directory. The usage of '&&' ensures that the 'dir' command will only run if the 'cd' command is executed without errors.\n\nIt is important to note that since the function relies on `os.system()`, it is synchronous; it will wait for the command to complete before moving on to the next line of code in the script. This can be useful when the completion of a command is necessary before subsequent actions can be performed.\n\nUsers should be cautious with the commands they execute, as running system commands can potentially alter system configurations or delete important data if used improperly. Additionally, the function assumes that the commands provided are compatible with the Windows command prompt syntax and environment.\n\nIn summary, this function provides a mechanism to execute one or more Windows command prompt commands from within a Python application, offering flexibility and control over system operations directly through Python scripts.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

This calculation is based on three critical input parameters: the distance traveled by the vehicle in a year, the type of fuel used by the vehicle, and the vehicle's fuel efficiency. \n\nThe first parameter, distance traveled, refers to the total number of miles or kilometers the vehicle covers over the course of a year. This data is essential as it directly impacts the total fuel consumption of the vehicle, which in turn influences the amount of CO2 emissions.\n\nThe second parameter is the fuel type, which specifies the kind of fuel the vehicle uses, such as gasoline, diesel, or alternative fuels like natural gas or electricity. Each fuel type has a distinct carbon emission factor, which determines how much CO2 is released per unit of fuel consumed. For instance, gasoline and diesel have different carbon contents and thus different emission impacts when burned.\n\nThe third parameter, fuel efficiency, indicates how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel, typically expressed as miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). Higher fuel efficiency implies that the vehicle can travel farther on a smaller amount of fuel, thereby reducing the overall CO2 emissions.\n\nBy combining these three parameters, the function calculates the vehicle's total annual CO2 emissions, providing valuable insights for individuals or organizations aiming to monitor and reduce their carbon footprint. The function assumes standard emissions factors and consistent fuel consumption across the distance traveled.

It is triggered when the automated system, which typically handles routine inquiries and provides automated responses, encounters a question or issue that exceeds its programmed capabilities or predefined scope. This transfer is crucial to ensure that the user's needs are adequately addressed, maintaining the quality and effectiveness of the customer service experience.\n\nThe function operates by recognizing when the automated system is unable to provide an appropriate response. This recognition can occur through various methods, such as the system identifying keywords or phrases that it has not been programmed to understand, or when it fails to produce a satisfactory answer after a certain number of attempts.\n\nOnce the function is triggered, it initiates the transfer process, which involves redirecting the chat session to a human agent. This human agent is typically trained to handle more complex queries, providing personalized assistance that the automated system cannot. The transfer process may involve notifying the user of the upcoming handover, ensuring a smooth transition without abrupt interruptions in communication.\n\nAn edge case to consider is ensuring that the transfer function handles scenarios where no human agents are available, possibly by queuing the user or providing an estimated wait time. Additionally, the function should preserve the chat history to provide the human agent with context, thereby avoiding the need for the user to repeat previously provided information.\n\nHere is an example of how this function might be employed: A user interacting with an automated customer support chatbot asks a highly specific technical question that the bot is not programmed to answer.

By examining the relationships between the chords, including their harmonic and melodic tendencies, the function identifies a tonal center or key that best fits the overall sequence of chords.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **chord_progression (list of str):** A list consisting of chord names, each represented as a string. The chords should be specified in a recognizable format, such as \"C\", \"Gm\", \"F#dim\", etc. The list can include major, minor, diminished, augmented, and other chord types, with or without extensions and alterations.\n\n#### Returns:\n- **key_signature (str):** A string representing the identified key signature. This might include major or minor modes and is expressed using standard musical notation, such as \"C Major\" or \"A Minor\". The function aims to return the key signature that most logically aligns with the chord progression.\n\n#### Details:\n- The function considers various elements of music theory, such as the presence of dominant-tonic relationships, common chord patterns, and the frequency and order of chord occurrences. It evaluates these factors to infer the most plausible key signature.\n- It is worth noting that while the function strives to identify the most appropriate key signature, some chord progressions may fit multiple keys or may not conform neatly to a single key due to their complexity or ambiguity.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- **Multiple Possible Keys:** In cases where the chord progression could fit into more than one key signature equally well, the function may use additional heuristics or default to a more commonly used key.\n- **Unclear Tonality:** For progressions that lack a clear tonal center, such as those with many modulations or non-diatonic chords, the function might return a best guess based on partial matches or could indicate uncertainty.\n\n#### Example Usage", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"progression": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "The chord progression in Roman numerals.

Examples could include gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian, nut-free, dairy-free, or any other specific dietary needs. This ensures that the recipes suggested do not contain ingredients that the user needs to avoid or prefer not to consume.\n\n2. **Recipe Type**: This parameter enables users to select the type of recipe they are interested in. This could encompass a variety of categories such as appetizers, main courses, desserts, beverages, salads, or soups. By specifying the recipe type, users can narrow down the search to match their immediate culinary interest or requirement.\n\n3. **Time Constraints**: With this parameter, users can indicate how much time they have available to prepare the recipe.
