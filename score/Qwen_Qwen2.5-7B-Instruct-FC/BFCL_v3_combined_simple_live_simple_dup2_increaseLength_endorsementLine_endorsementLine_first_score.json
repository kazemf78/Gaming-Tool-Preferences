Its primary role is to extract and return the answer contained within the LLM's output. This function takes the raw response from the LLM as its input. By analyzing the structure and content of the response, it identifies the portion that constitutes the answer. If the response includes a recognizable and valid answer, this portion is returned as the output of the function.

Such processes are characterized by a constant temperature throughout and progress without any entropy production due to irreversibilities. The function relies on the fundamental thermodynamic relationship that defines entropy change in these specific conditions.\n\n#### Key Characteristics:\n\n1. **Isothermal Process:**\n   - The process occurs at a constant temperature. This implies that throughout the entire process, the temperature of the system does not change. This is in contrast to adiabatic processes where there is no heat exchange or processes where temperature varies.\n\n2. **Reversible Process:**\n   - The process is reversible, meaning it can be reversed by infinitesimally small changes in a property of the system, with no net change in entropy occurring in the surroundings. This idealized condition assumes that the process happens infinitely slowly so that the system remains in thermodynamic equilibrium at all times.\n\n3. **Entropy Change Calculation:**\n   - The entropy change (\\( \\Delta S \\)) for an isothermal, reversible process is calculated using the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\Delta S = \\frac{Q_{\\text{rev}}}{T}\n     \\]\n     where \\( Q_{\\text{rev}} \\) is the reversible heat exchanged and \\( T \\) is the absolute temperature at which the process occurs. It is important to note that \\( T \\) must be in Kelvin to maintain consistency with thermodynamic conventions.\n\n#### Parameter Explanation:\n\n- **\\( Q_{\\text{rev}} \\):**\n  - This parameter represents the amount of heat that is reversibly exchanged in the process. It is typically expressed in units of energy such as joules (J) or calories (cal).\n\n- **\\( T \\):**\n  - Represents the absolute temperature at which the process occurs. It should be provided in Kelvin (K)", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"initial_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial temperature in Kelvin."}, "final_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The final temperature in Kelvin."}, "heat_capacity": {"type": "integer", "description": "The heat capacity in J/K."}, "isothermal": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether the process is isothermal.

For strings, it returns the characters in reverse order. For booleans, it returns the negation. For numbers, it returns the negative value.The function is designed to reverse or invert the provided input, thereby transforming it into its opposite form based on the data type. Let's break down the behavior according to different input types:\n\n1. **Strings**: When the input is a string, the function processes the sequence of characters by reversing their order. For instance, if the input is the string \"hello\", the function will output \"olleh\". This operation is applicable to strings of any length, including empty strings. An empty string will simply return as an empty string since there are no characters to reorder.\n\n2. **Booleans**: In the case of a boolean input, the function will return the logical negation of the given value. Therefore, if the input is `true`, the function will return `false`, and if the input is `false`, it will return `true`. This inversion adheres to the standard logical NOT operation.\n\n3. **Numbers**: For numerical inputs, the function's operation is to return the negative value of the number, effectively changing its sign. For example, an input of `5` will result in `-5`, and conversely, an input of `-3.5` will output `3.5`. It is important to note that for an input of `0`, the function will still return `0`, as the negation of zero is zero itself.\n\nThrough this function, users can efficiently transform the input across different data types, ensuring the result is the conceptual opposite of the original value.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["input_value"], "properties": {"input_value": {"type": "any", "description": "The value to be reversed.

It is crucial for determining the base from which returns are calculated. The investment amount should be a positive numerical value representing the amount in currency units (e.g., dollars, euros).\n\n3. **Time Period**: This parameter indicates the duration for which the investment is held. The time period is usually expressed in years and should be a positive integer or a decimal value. For instance, an investment period of 5 years could be entered as 5 or 5.0.\n\n#### Calculation Process:\n\nThe function employs the formula for calculating compound interest, adjusted for mutual funds. The estimated return is derived by applying the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Estimated Return} = \\text{Investment Amount} \\times (1 + \\text{Yearly Yield})^{\\text{Time Period}} \\]\n\nThis calculation assumes that the yield is compounded annually, meaning the investment grows at the yearly yield rate each year over the specified time period.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- If the yearly yield is 0, the function should return the original investment amount, as no growth would occur without yield.\n- Negative values for the yearly yield are generally not expected and", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"yearly_yield": {"type": "float", "description": "The yearly yield of the mutual fund as a percentage."}, "investment_amount": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial investment amount in the mutual fund."}, "years": {"type": "integer", "description": "The time period for which the investment is made in years."}}, "required": ["yearly_yield", "investment_amount", "years"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"estimate_mutual_fund_return1": {"yearly_yield": 0.05, "investment_amount": 2000, "years": 3}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"estimate_mutual_fund_return1": {"yearly_yield": 0.05, "investment_amount": 2000, "years": 3}}], "possible_answer": [{"estimate_mutual_fund_return1": {"yearly_yield": [5.0], "investment_amount": [2000], "years": [3]}}, {"estimate_mutual_fund_return2": {"yearly_yield": [5.0], "investment_amount": [2000], "years": [3]}}, {"estimate_mutual_fund_return3": {"yearly_yield": [5.0], "investment_amount": [2000], "years": [3]}}]}

The `os.system()` function is primarily designed to send a command to the system's command interpreter, which in Windows is typically the Command Prompt, known as `cmd.exe`. Once invoked, the command string passed to `os.system()` will be executed as though it were typed directly into the command line interface.\n\nThe command to be executed must be provided as a string argument to this function.

This return code can be used for basic error handling.\n\nAn edge case to consider is that `os.system()` cannot handle multi-line commands directly.

This calculation is based on three critical input parameters: the distance traveled by the vehicle in a year, the type of fuel used by the vehicle, and the vehicle's fuel efficiency. \n\nThe first parameter, distance traveled, refers to the total number of miles or kilometers the vehicle covers over the course of a year. This data is essential as it directly impacts the total fuel consumption of the vehicle, which in turn influences the amount of CO2 emissions.\n\nThe second parameter is the fuel type, which specifies the kind of fuel the vehicle uses, such as gasoline, diesel, or alternative fuels like natural gas or electricity. Each fuel type has a distinct carbon emission factor, which determines how much CO2 is released per unit of fuel consumed. For instance, gasoline and diesel have different carbon contents and thus different emission impacts when burned.\n\nThe third parameter, fuel efficiency, indicates how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel, typically expressed as miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). Higher fuel efficiency implies that the vehicle can travel farther on a smaller amount of fuel, thereby reducing the overall CO2 emissions.\n\nBy combining these three parameters, the function calculates the vehicle's total annual CO2 emissions, providing valuable insights for individuals or organizations aiming to monitor and reduce their carbon footprint. The function assumes standard emissions factors and consistent fuel consumption across the distance traveled. It is important to use accurate measurements for each parameter to ensure the reliability of the emission estimates.\n\nUsage Example:\nAssume a vehicle travels 15,000 miles in a year, uses gasoline as fuel, and has a fuel efficiency of 25 miles per gallon.

The booking is made at a specific hotel location, ensuring that the reservation aligns with the user's preferred travel dates and accommodation preferences. The booking process begins on a specified start date, which marks the first night of the stay.\n\nParameters for this function typically include the type of room desired, such as a single, double, suite, or any other category that the hotel might offer. This ensures that the accommodation meets the guest's needs and expectations. Additionally, the function requires the number of nights the guest intends to stay, which determines the reservation duration and helps calculate the total cost.\n\nThe function also takes into account the specific hotel where the accommodation is to be booked. This is essential for users who have a particular location in mind or are looking to stay at a preferred hotel chain.\n\nFinally, the function requires a start date, which specifies when the booking should commence.
