If not specified, function may return complex roots.The function is designed to solve a quadratic equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where 'a', 'b', and 'c' are coefficients supplied as inputs. This function efficiently calculates the roots of the quadratic equation by applying the quadratic formula: x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a). It is important to note that the coefficient 'a' must not be zero, as the equation would then not be quadratic.\n\nAn optional parameter, 'root_type', can be specified to control the nature of the roots returned by the function.

This is particularly useful in cases where the application requires non-complex solutions, such as in certain engineering or physics problems.\n\nIf the 'root_type' parameter is not specified, the function defaults to returning both real and complex roots.

It requires the user to specify the restaurant from which they wish to order as well as the specific food items they intend to purchase, along with the corresponding quantities for each item. \n\n#### Parameters:\n- **Restaurant Selection**: The user must provide the name or unique identifier of the restaurant from which they want to order. This ensures that the function targets the correct establishment on the Uber Eats platform, thereby accessing the menu specific to that restaurant.\n  \n- **Items and Quantities**: The user should specify the exact menu items they wish to order. Alongside each item, the user must indicate the desired quantity. This involves creating a list or dictionary structure where each entry contains a menu item as the key and the quantity as the value, allowing for precise order customization.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nSuppose a user wants to order from the restaurant \"Joe's Burger Shack.\" They decide to order two cheeseburgers and one side of fries. The function call might look like this:\n\n```python\nplace_order(restaurant=\"Joe's Burger Shack\", items={\"Cheeseburger\": 2, \"Fries\": 1})\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The `restaurant` parameter is set to \"Joe's Burger Shack\".\n- The `items` parameter is a dictionary with keys representing menu items (\"Cheeseburger\" and \"Fries\") and values indicating the quantities (2 and 1, respectively).\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- **Invalid Restaurant Name/Identifier**: If the provided restaurant name or identifier does not match any current listings on Uber Eats, the function should handle this gracefully by notifying the user of the error and possibly suggesting alternative options.\n  \n- **Unavailable Items or Incorrect Quantities**: If a specified item is not available in the chosen restaurant's menu or if the quantity is not feasible (e.g.,", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["restaurant", "items", "quantities"], "properties": {"restaurant": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the restaurant from which to order food."}, "items": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of food item names selected for the order."}, "quantities": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "integer"}, "description": "A list of quantities for each food item, corresponding by index to the items array."}}}}]}, "model_result_raw": "It seems like there might be a bit of a mix-up.

An isothermal process is one that occurs at a constant temperature, meaning that the temperature of the system does not change during the process. A reversible process, on the other hand, is an idealized process that occurs infinitely slowly and can be reversed without leaving any change in either the system or the surroundings.\n\nIn the context of thermodynamics, entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system. For an isothermal and reversible process, the change in entropy (\u0394S) can be determined using the definition of entropy in relation to heat transfer. Specifically, the change in entropy is calculated using the formula: \u0394S = Q/T, where \u0394S is the change in entropy, Q is the amount of heat absorbed or released by the system, and T is the absolute temperature at which the process occurs, maintained constant throughout the process.\n\nThis function requires that the user input the values of Q, the heat exchanged, and T, the constant temperature, to compute the resulting entropy change. It is crucial to ensure that the temperature is given in an absolute scale, such as Kelvin, to avoid errors in the calculation. Furthermore, if the direction of heat transfer is into the system, Q should be positive, while if it is out of the system, Q should be negative, in accordance with the sign convention typically used in thermodynamics.\n\nAn example of using this function could be calculating the entropy change when 500 J of heat is added to a system at a constant temperature of 300 K. By substituting these values into the formula, the change in entropy would be calculated as follows: \u0394S = 500 J / 300 K, resulting in \u0394S = 1.67 J/K.\n\nOverall, this function is valuable for understanding how energy transformations impact the entropy of a system under the specific conditions of an isothermal and reversible process, which are common in theoretical studies and", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"initial_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial temperature in Kelvin."}, "final_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The final temperature in Kelvin."}, "heat_capacity": {"type": "integer", "description": "The heat capacity in J/K."}, "isothermal": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether the process is isothermal.

It bases its prediction on the individual's physical measurements, specifically their weight and height.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **Weight**: The weight of the person expressed in kilograms (kg). It is crucial to ensure that the weight is accurate as it significantly influences the likelihood calculation.\n  \n- **Height**: The height of the person provided in meters (m). Accurate measurement is important for reliable predictions.\n\n#### Functionality:\nThe function utilizes weight and height to calculate the body mass index (BMI) of the individual. BMI is a well-known indicator used in medical fields to assess whether an individual falls within a healthy weight range. Since excess body weight is a known risk factor for type 2 diabetes, the BMI result is a critical factor in predicting diabetes likelihood.\n\nThe function applies a statistical model based on existing medical research data to evaluate how these measurements correlate with the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. It uses this model to generate a likelihood score, which can help medical professionals or individuals understand their risk level.\n\n#### Edge Cases and Considerations:\n- Ensure that both weight and height are input in the correct units to avoid inaccuracies in BMI calculation.\n- The model is based on general population data, so individual risk factors beyond weight and height, such as genetic predisposition and lifestyle, are not accounted for in this prediction.\n- It is important to use the likelihood score as a preliminary assessment and follow up with a healthcare provider for comprehensive risk evaluation and advice.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n```python\n# Example: Predict diabetes type 2 likelihood\nweight_kg = 70  # in kilograms\nheight_m = 1.75  # in meters\n\nlikelihood_score = predict_diabetes_type_2_likelihood(weight_kg, height_m)\nprint(f\"The likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes is {likelihood_score}%\")\n``", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"weight": {"type": "integer", "description": "Weight of the person in lbs."}, "height": {"type": "integer", "description": "Height of the person in inches."}, "activity_level": {"type": "string", "enum": ["sedentary", "lightly active", "moderately active", "very active", "extra active"], "description": "Physical activity level of the person."}}, "required": ["weight", "height", "activity_level"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"diabetes_prediction1": {"weight": 150, "height": 68, "activity_level": "lightly active"}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"diabetes_prediction1": {"weight": 150, "height": 68, "activity_level": "lightly active"}}], "possible_answer": [{"diabetes_prediction1": {"weight": [150], "height": [70], "activity_level": ["lightly active"]}}, {"diabetes_prediction2": {"weight": [150], "height": [70], "activity_level": ["lightly active"]}}, {"diabetes_prediction3": {"weight": [150], "height": [70], "activity_level": ["lightly active"]}}]}

When sorting in ascending order, the function rearranges the elements so that smaller values appear before larger ones. Conversely, when sorting in descending order, larger values are placed before smaller ones. It is important to note that for the sorting to be successful, the elements within the list must be of a type that supports comparison operations. The function may include an optional parameter, often referred to as `reverse`, which specifies the order of sorting. By default, the function sorts the list in ascending order. If the `reverse` parameter is set to `True`, the function will sort the list in descending order instead.

This calculation is particularly useful in scenarios requiring precise measurements of angles, such as graphical representations of clocks or mathematical problems involving time and angles.\n\n### Parameters:\n- **hour (int)**: The hour value from the given time, typically ranging from 0 to 23. If the hour is represented in a 12-hour format, it should be adjusted accordingly to fit within the 0-11 range for the calculation.\n- **minute (int)**: The minute value from the given time, ranging from 0 to 59. This value determines the position of the minute hand on the clock face.\n\n### Function Details:\nThis function computes the angle in degrees. The clock is considered circular, with 360 degrees representing a full rotation. A key aspect of the calculation is that the angle is measured in a clockwise direction from the hour hand to the minute hand. The result provided is the acute angle between the two hands, meaning the function always returns the smaller of the two possible angles.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- **Exactly on the Hour**: If the minute is 0, the minute hand is at the 12 o'clock position, and the hour hand's position is determined solely by the hour value.\n- **Same Hour and Minute**: If both hands overlap, such as at 12:00, the calculated angle will be 0 degrees.\n- **Maximum Separation**: At times like 6:00, the hands are diametrically opposite to each other, resulting in an angle of 180 degrees.\n\n### Usage Example:\nTo calculate the angle at 3:15:\n1. The hour hand is at a quarter past three, contributing to its position at 3/12 * 360 + 15/60 * 30 = 97.5 degrees.\n2.

The function requires two main inputs: the purchase amount, which is the total monetary value of the items or services before any taxes are added, and the jurisdiction, which determines the specific tax rules and percentages to apply.\n\nOnce these inputs are provided, the function computes the sales tax by applying the relevant jurisdictional tax rate to the purchase amount.

It serves as a tool for organizing and categorizing customer interactions based on predefined classification criteria or categories, enabling better handling and analysis of customer service data.\n\n#### Functionality\n- **Purpose**: The primary goal of this function is to ensure that each customer query is associated with an appropriate classification. This process is crucial for maintaining an organized database of customer interactions, facilitating efficient query handling, and enabling data-driven insights into customer service performance.\n\n- **Input**: The function typically takes specific parameters that include the details of the customer service query. This can include information such as the query ID, customer details, and the classification category, which may be predetermined by an automated system or a customer service agent.\n\n- **Process**: Upon receiving the necessary input parameters, the function records the classification in a centralized system. This might involve updating a database or a CRM system with the classification details, ensuring that the query is stored under the correct category.\n\n- **Output**: The function does not necessarily return a value but ensures that the classification is stored correctly. Success or failure in recording the classification might be logged or signaled through a status message or a boolean indicator.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n- **Invalid Classification**: If a query is attempted to be classified into a category that does not exist or is invalid, the function should handle this gracefully, possibly by returning an error message or logging the incident for further investigation.\n\n- **Duplicate Queries**: In cases where the same customer query is attempted to be classified multiple times, the function should check for duplicates to prevent redundant data entries.\n\n- **Data Integrity**: The function must ensure the integrity and accuracy of the classification data, avoiding situations where queries are misclassified due to incorrect input parameters.\n\n#### Usage Example\nConsider a scenario where a customer service department receives a query related to billing issues.

This value is crucial as it sets the baseline for all future growth calculations. The annual growth rate is expressed as a percentage, signifying the expected increase in the value of the investment for each year it is held. This rate is assumed to be constant throughout the holding period, which implies that the growth is compounded annually.\n\nThe holding period refers to the duration, measured in years, for which the investment is held before the returns are calculated. It is important to note that this function assumes that the annual growth rate remains consistent over the entire holding period, enabling the application of compound interest calculations to determine the final projected return.\n\nThe formula used to calculate the projected return is based on the principle of compound interest, given by the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Projected Return} = \\text{Investment Amount} \\times (1 + \\frac{\\text{Annual Growth Rate}}{100})^{\\text{Holding Period}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- The Investment Amount is the initial sum of money invested.\n- The Annual Growth Rate is divided by 100 to convert the percentage into a decimal for calculation purposes.\n- The Holding Period is the number of years the money is invested.\n\nAn example of usage for this function could be as follows: if an investor places $10,000 into a stock with an anticipated annual growth rate of 5% and plans to hold the investment for 10 years, the function will calculate the projected return by plugging these values into the formula, resulting in a future value of approximately $16,288.95.\n\nIt is important for users of this function to ensure the accuracy of their inputs, particularly the investment amount and growth rate, as any errors in these values", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"investment_amount": {"type": "integer", "description": "The amount of money to invest."}, "annual_growth_rate": {"type": "float", "description": "The expected annual growth rate of the stock."}, "holding_period": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of years you intend to hold the stock."}, "dividends": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Optional.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.The function is designed to execute system-level commands specifically on Windows operating systems by utilizing the `os.system()` method from Python's `os` module. This function is capable of executing not only individual commands but also allowing for the execution of multiple commands that can be linked or combined using the logical AND operator, represented by '&&'. This chaining of commands means that the subsequent command will only be executed if the preceding command completes successfully, without error. It is important to note that the `os.system()` function sends the specified command(s) to the command interpreter, which on Windows is typically `cmd.exe`, for execution. This function is generally used for simple command execution and does not provide access to the input, output, or error streams of the command. \n\nAs an example, if you want to create a directory and then navigate into it only if the directory creation was successful, you could use the function to execute the command string `mkdir new_folder && cd new_folder`. Here, `mkdir new_folder` will attempt to create a directory named `new_folder`, and if this operation is successful, `cd new_folder` will change the current directory to `new_folder`.\n\nWhen utilizing this function, it is also crucial to consider security implications, especially if the command string is constructed from external input, as this could lead to command injection vulnerabilities. Proper input validation and sanitization should be performed to mitigate such risks. Additionally, because `os.system()` does not capture the standard output or error streams, if you need to process the output of the executed commands or handle errors more gracefully, you might need to consider using other functions such as `subprocess.run()` which provide more control and flexibility over command execution.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.The function is designed to execute system-level commands specifically on Windows operating systems. It utilizes the `os.system()` method, which is a part of the `os` module in Python, to carry out this task. The `os.system()` function is a straightforward way to run commands as if they were being executed directly in the command prompt of Windows. This can include a wide range of operations, from simple directory listings to more complex command scripts.\n\nA notable feature of this function is its ability to handle multiple commands at once. This is achieved by chaining commands together using the '&&' operator. In the context of command execution, the '&&' operator allows users to run several commands in sequence. The subsequent command will only execute if the preceding command is successful, meaning it returns a zero exit status. This feature is particularly useful for executing a series of dependent commands where the success of one command is required for the next to proceed.\n\nFor example, a user can execute a command string such as `\"dir && echo 'Listed directories'\"`. In this case, the `dir` command will list the contents of the current directory. If this operation is successful, it will proceed to execute the `echo 'Listed directories'` command, which outputs the text 'Listed directories' to the console. This chaining feature enhances the versatility of the function, enabling more complex command sequences to be executed in a controlled manner.\n\nWhen using this function, it is important to handle the commands carefully to avoid any unintended system changes or security vulnerabilities.

This function transmits the command string directly to the underlying system shell to be executed. If there are multiple commands that need to be executed in sequence, you can concatenate them within a single string using the '&&' operator.

This calculation is essential for understanding the environmental impact of a vehicle's operation over the course of a year. The function takes into account three primary factors to determine these emissions: the distance traveled by the vehicle, the type of fuel that the vehicle uses, and the fuel efficiency of the vehicle.\n\n1. **Distance Traveled**: This parameter represents the total number of miles or kilometers that the vehicle covers in a year. It is a crucial factor because the more a vehicle is driven, the more fuel it consumes, and consequently, the more emissions it produces.\n\n2. **Fuel Type**: The type of fuel used by the vehicle plays a significant role in the calculation. Different fuels have varying carbon content and therefore produce different amounts of carbon dioxide when burned. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, and alternative fuels like natural gas or electricity. Each of these fuels has a specific carbon dioxide emission factor, which is used in the calculation to ensure accurate results.\n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency**: Also known as fuel economy, this parameter measures how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel to cover a distance. It is typically expressed in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). A vehicle with higher fuel efficiency will consume less fuel over the same distance compared to a less efficient vehicle, thereby producing fewer emissions.\n\nThe function combines these parameters in a formula to determine the total annual carbon dioxide emissions for the vehicle. It is important to input accurate values for each parameter to ensure the validity of the calculation. This information can be beneficial for vehicle owners seeking to reduce their carbon footprint by understanding the emissions associated with their driving habits and vehicle characteristics.\n\n**Example Usage**:\n- A user can input the following: a vehicle that travels 15,000 miles annually, runs on gasoline, and has a fuel efficiency of 25 MPG.

It takes into account the standard rankings of Poker hands, such as Royal Flush, Straight Flush, Four of a Kind, Full House, Flush, Straight, Three of a Kind, Two Pair, One Pair, and High Card. The function analyzes the cards held by each player, identifies the best possible hand each player can make, and then compares these hands against each other to decide which is the strongest according to the rules of Poker.\n\nWhen multiple players have hands of the same rank, the function further evaluates their hands by comparing the values of the individual cards that make up the hand. For example, if two players both have a flush, the player with the highest card in their flush wins. If necessary, the comparison continues to the second-highest card, third-highest, and so on, until a winner is determined or a tie is declared.\n\nThe function handles edge cases, such as ties between players, by considering detailed Poker rules, including kicker cards or splitting the pot when players have identical hands. It ensures that all players' hands are correctly interpreted according to Poker rules and that the winner is accurately determined. In the event of a tie where the pot must be split, the function will also account for this scenario, ensuring fair and accurate outcomes.\n\nThis function is crucial for automating the decision-making process in a Poker game, providing a reliable way to determine the winner quickly and efficiently without requiring manual intervention. It is an essential component for any digital Poker game or Poker analysis tool, enabling fair play and accurate results.\n\nUsage Example:\n- Suppose Player A has a hand with a pair of Kings and Player B has a hand with a pair of Aces.
