BMI is a widely used screening tool that categorizes individuals based on their body weight in relation to their height, providing an estimate of body fatness.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- **Weight**: This parameter represents the body weight of the individual, typically measured in kilograms (kg). It is a crucial component of the BMI calculation, as it is directly proportional to the BMI value.\n  \n- **Height**: This parameter refers to the height of the individual, usually measured in meters (m). Height is a key factor in determining the BMI, as it is inversely proportional to the BMI value. It is important to ensure the height is provided in meters for accurate results.\n\n**BMI Calculation Formula:**\nThe function uses the standard BMI formula:\n\\[ \\text{BMI} = \\frac{\\text{Weight (kg)}}{\\text{Height (m)}^2} \\]\nThis formula divides the individual's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. The resulting BMI value helps assess whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on standard classification ranges.\n\n**Example Usage:**\nTo use this function, input the weight and height of the person as arguments. For instance, if a person weighs 70 kg and is 1.75 meters tall, the function call might look like this: `calculate_bmi(70, 1.75)`. This would calculate the BMI as follows: \\( \\frac{70}{1.75^2} \\approx 22.86 \\).\n\n**Edge Cases and Considerations:**\n- Ensure that the height is not zero to avoid division by zero errors.\n- The function assumes the weight is non-negative and that height is positive. Negative or zero values for weight or height would result in inaccurate or undefined BMI values.\n- The BMI does not directly measure body fat and can", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"weight_kg": {"type": "integer", "description": "The weight of the person in kilograms."}, "height_m": {"type": "float", "description": "The height of the person in meters."}}, "required": ["weight_kg", "height_m"]}}]}

This calculation considers the position of both hands based on the given hour and minute input. The function takes into account the following rules and scenarios:\n\n1. **Input Parameters**: The function requires two inputs: the hour and the minute. The hour is typically an integer ranging from 1 to 12, representing the conventional 12-hour clock format. The minute is also an integer, ranging from 0 to 59, representing the minutes past the hour.\n\n2. **Hour Hand Calculation**: The position of the hour hand is determined by the given hour and minute. The hour hand moves as the minutes pass, so its position is not fixed to a whole number. Specifically, each hour represents a 30-degree movement from the 12 o'clock position (since 360 degrees divided by 12 hours equals 30 degrees per hour). Additionally, for every minute passed, the hour hand moves an additional 0.5 degrees (since each minute is 1/60th of an hour, and 30 degrees divided by 60 equals 0.5 degrees per minute).\n\n3. **Minute Hand Calculation**: The position of the minute hand is more straightforward, as it is determined solely by the minute input. For every minute, the minute hand moves 6 degrees (since 360 degrees divided by 60 minutes equals 6 degrees per minute).\n\n4. **Angle Calculation**: Once both hand positions are determined, the function calculates the absolute difference between the two angles. Since a clock is circular and the angle could be reflex (greater than 180 degrees), the function also computes the smaller angle between the two, which is the direct angle between the hands. This is done by considering the smaller of the two angles: the calculated angle and 360 degrees minus the calculated angle.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**: The function should handle special cases, such as", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"hours": {"type": "integer", "description": "The hour on the clock face."}, "minutes": {"type": "integer", "description": "The minutes on the clock face."}, "round_to": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of decimal places to round the result to, default is 2."}}, "required": ["hours", "minutes"]}}]}

It takes into account the distance between the two celestial bodies and utilizes the speed of light as a constant to determine the travel time.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **distance (float)**: The distance between the two celestial bodies, measured in kilometers. It is important that this parameter accurately represents the spatial separation to ensure a precise calculation of the time taken for light to travel.\n\n- **speed_of_light (float, optional)**: The speed of light in a vacuum, typically provided as 299,792 kilometers per second. By default, this value is used unless otherwise specified, as variations can occur in different mediums; however, space is generally considered a vacuum.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\nThe primary functionality of this function is to compute the time taken using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed of Light}} \\]\n\nThe result is the duration, in seconds, that it takes for light to traverse the specified distance between the celestial bodies.

The unit of measurement for distance can vary (e.g., meters, kilometers, miles), but it is important to ensure consistency with the unit used for time to obtain an accurate speed calculation.\n\n- **Time (t):** This is a numerical value that indicates the duration for which the object was in motion. The unit of measurement for time (e.g., seconds, hours) should be consistent with the unit of distance to ensure the resulting speed is meaningful.\n\n#### Returns:\n\nThe function returns a single numerical value representing the speed of the object. The unit of speed will depend on the units used for distance and time. For example, if distance is provided in meters and time in seconds, the speed will be calculated in meters per second (m/s).\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- If the time parameter is zero, the function must handle this case gracefully, as division by zero is undefined.

The goal of this linear regression model is to establish a linear relationship between these predictor variables and the target variable.\n\nThe function typically begins by taking as input a dataset containing the predictor variables and the target variable.

This payment is a percentage of the bond's face value and serves as the primary cash flow component considered in the DCF calculation. The time frame indicates the total number of years or periods over which these coupon payments will be received. The discount rate, often reflective of the market interest rate or the required rate of return, is used to discount future cash flows back to their present value.\n\nThe DCF calculation involves summing the present value of each of these annual coupon payments.

To achieve this, each cash flow is individually discounted back to its present value using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{PV} = \\frac{CF}{(1 + r)^t} \\]\n\nwhere \\( CF \\) represents the cash flow for a given period, \\( r \\) is the discount rate or the interest rate, and \\( t \\) is the time period in which the cash flow occurs. \n\nThe sum of all these present values gives the NPV, which quantitatively measures the difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows over the investment period.

To achieve this, the function utilizes a formula that accounts for compound growth, which is commonly applied in financial calculations to estimate future investment value.\n\n- **Investment Amount**: This parameter represents the initial sum of money invested in the stock. It serves as the principal upon which returns are calculated. It is important that this value is specified as a positive number, as negative or zero values do not constitute a valid starting investment.\n\n- **Annual Growth Rate**: This input reflects the expected percentage increase in the value of the investment per annum. Provided as a decimal (e.g., an 8% annual growth rate should be input as 0.08), it models how the investment is anticipated to grow each year over the specified holding period. Negative growth rates can be used to reflect anticipated declines in value, highlighting the function's versatility in handling both optimistic and pessimistic market projections.\n\n- **Holding Period (in years)**: This parameter denotes the length of time for which the investment is expected to be held. It is expressed in years and is essential for determining the compounding effect on the investment over time. The function assumes that the annual growth rate is consistently applied throughout the entire period.

This calculation is essential for investors looking to project the potential growth of their investment over time, based on the assumption that the annual return remains constant throughout the investment period.\n\n### Parameters:\n1. **Invested Amount**: This parameter represents the initial amount of money that is invested in the stock. It is crucial as it serves as the baseline from which future value is calculated.\n2. **Expected Annual Return**: Expressed as a percentage, this parameter indicates the rate at which the investment is expected to grow each year. It assumes a constant annual growth rate, which may or may not reflect actual market conditions, but is useful for projection purposes.\n3. **Number of Years**: This parameter specifies the timeframe over which the investment is expected to grow.

It is typically provided as a decimal, where a 5% return would be input as 0.05. The yield rate is crucial as it directly influences the growth of the investment over time.\n\n2. **Investment Amount**: This is the initial sum of money that is invested in the mutual fund. It represents the principal amount upon which the returns will be calculated. The investment amount is essential for determining the scale of the potential returns, with larger investments leading to proportionately higher estimated returns, assuming the same yield rate and time period.\n\n3. **Time Period**: This parameter specifies the duration, usually in years, for which the investment is held in the mutual fund. The time period impacts the compounding effect, where longer durations typically result in greater overall returns due to the exponential growth facilitated by compounding interest.\n\nThe calculation process assumes the concept of compound interest, where the returns are reinvested and generate their own returns over time. This means that each year, the mutual fund's yield is applied not only to the original investment amount but also to the accumulated returns from previous years.\n\nFor example, if an investor puts $10,000 into a mutual fund with an annual yield of 7% for 5 years, the function will estimate the future value of this investment by applying the compound interest formula. It multiplies the original investment by the compound factor, which is calculated using the formula \\( (1 + \\text{yearly yield})^{\\text{time period}} \\).

This identifier is crucial for the function to locate the correct company in the stock market database.\n  \n- **Number of Days:** This parameter specifies the range of historical data you wish to retrieve. It is an integer value that denotes how many days back from the current date the stock price data should be collected. For instance, if the number is set to 5, the function will provide stock prices for the past five trading days, assuming the stock market was open on those days.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The function should handle scenarios where the requested number of days extends beyond the company's IPO date or when there are market holidays within the specified range.\n- If the stock market was closed on specific days within the requested period (e.g., weekends or holidays), the function should only return data for the days when trading occurred.\n- It should also consider cases where the ticker symbol is invalid or not listed on the stock exchange, in which case an appropriate error message or exception should be returned.\n\nUsage Example:\nSuppose you want to get the stock price data for Microsoft Corporation over the last 10 trading days. You would call the function with the ticker symbol 'MSFT' and specify 10 as the number of days. The function would then output the historical stock prices for Microsoft across those 10 trading days, taking into account any non-trading days. \n\nThis function is highly useful for investors and analysts who need to quickly access recent stock performance data for analysis or decision-making purposes", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"company": {"type": "string", "description": "The company name."}, "days": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of previous days to retrieve data for."}, "data_type": {"type": "string", "description": "The type of price data to retrieve (e.g., 'Open', 'Close', 'High', 'Low').

A higher synaptic input rate typically results in a greater excitation of the neuron, which in turn increases its firing rate.\n\nAdditionally, the function considers the weight of these inputs, which reflects the strength or importance of each synaptic connection. A larger weight amplifies the input's effect on the neuron, thereby enhancing the firing rate.

Account for coverage efficiency of the paint and exclusions (like windows).The function is designed to calculate the total quantity of paint needed to cover a specified area, taking into consideration several key factors that affect the amount of paint used. Firstly, the function considers the coverage efficiency of the paint, which refers to how much area a single unit of paint can cover. This efficiency can vary based on the type and quality of paint, and it is crucial for determining the correct amount of paint required.\n\nAdditionally, the function accounts for exclusions within the specified area, such as windows, doors, or any other features that do not require painting. By excluding these areas from the calculation, the function ensures that the estimated amount of paint is both accurate and efficient, preventing unnecessary waste of paint.\n\n### Parameters:\n- **area**: The total surface area intended for painting, expressed in square units (e.g., square meters or square feet). This is the initial measurement before any exclusions are considered.\n- **coverage_efficiency**: The coverage capability of the paint, typically measured as the area covered per unit of paint (e.g., square feet per gallon or square meters per liter). This parameter is essential for calculating how much paint is needed for the area.\n- **exclusions**: A collection of areas within the total surface area that should be omitted from paint calculations, such as windows or doors. These are subtracted from the total area to yield the net area that will actually be painted.\n\n### Usage Example:\nSuppose you need to paint a wall that is 500 square feet in total, but there are two windows, each taking up 20 square feet.

To do so, it requires a single input parameter, the radius, which should be a non-negative numerical value. The radius is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on its perimeter. Using this value, the function applies mathematical formulas to determine the area and circumference.\n\nThe area of a circle is calculated using the formula A = πr², where A represents the area and r is the radius. This formula derives from the geometric principle that the area is proportional to the square of the radius, scaled by the constant π (pi), approximately equal to 3.14159.\n\nSimilarly, the circumference, which represents the total distance around the circle, is computed using the formula C = 2πr. Here, C is the circumference, and r is the radius. This formula illustrates that the circumference is twice the product of the radius and π, reflecting the linear relationship between the diameter (twice the radius) and the perimeter.\n\nThe function should handle edge cases where the radius is zero, resulting in an area and circumference of zero, since a circle with no size does not enclose any space and has no perimeter. Additionally, it is essential that the function appropriately processes positive values, as negative radii do not correspond to a valid geometric circle.\n\nIn practical usage, a typical call to this function might look like this: `calculateCircleMetrics(radius)`, where `radius` is the radius of the circle supplied by the user.

The probability calculation involves determining the likelihood of selecting either a specific card, such as the Ace of Spades, or a specific suit, like hearts, when drawing from the full deck.\n\nTo calculate the probability of drawing a specific card, such as the Queen of Hearts, the function considers that there is only one copy of that card in the deck.

The full house probability calculation focuses on this hand size, examining all possible combinations that can result in a full house.\n\n3. **Combinatorial Calculation**:\n   - **Choosing Ranks**: The first step involves selecting a rank for the triplet (three of a kind). There are 13 possible ranks in the deck, each contributing to potential full house combinations.\n   - **Selecting Triplets**: For the chosen rank for the triplet, any three of the four available suits can form the triplet, calculated using the combination formula \\(\\binom{4}{3}\\).\n   - **Choosing Pairs**: After selecting the triplet rank, the calculation chooses a different rank for the pair. There are 12 remaining ranks available for this selection.\n   - **Selecting Pairs from Ranks**: For the rank chosen for the pair, any two of the four available suits can form the pair, determined by the combination formula \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\n4. **Total Calculation**: The above choices are combined to calculate the total number of different full house hands possible using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Full Houses} = 13 \\times \\", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"deck_size": {"type": "integer", "description": "The size of the deck.

It is a numerical value that should be positive to represent a valid monetary amount. Special considerations should be taken if the value is zero, as the conversion will yield zero in the target currency.\n  \n- **exchange_rate**: This parameter indicates the exchange rate from the base currency to the target currency. It is a crucial multiplier in the conversion process. An exchange rate value must be greater than zero for a meaningful conversion. Edge cases such as a zero or negative exchange rate would yield nonsensical results and should be handled appropriately, potentially with error messages or exceptions.\n\n### Usage Example:\nSuppose you have an amount of 100 units in a base currency (e.g., US dollars) and you want to determine how much this amount is worth in a target currency (e.g., Euros).

The function is case-sensitive and will not accept names that do not adhere to this requirement.

It takes an input that specifies the food item the customer desires to select. The critical aspect of this function is its adherence to a specific requirement: the name of the food item provided by the customer must be in uppercase letters. This ensures consistency and prevents errors that could arise from case sensitivity in processing food item names.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\n- **Input Requirement:** The function expects the food item name to be passed as a string. It is crucial that this string is entirely in uppercase letters. For example, if a customer wants to select \"pasta,\" the input should be \"PASTA\" instead of \"pasta\" or \"Pasta.\" This requirement is in place to maintain uniformity in how food items are recorded and processed within the system.\n\n- **Selection Process:** Upon receiving the request, the function checks the provided food name against a predefined list of available food items. It confirms that the requested food item exists in the list and then updates the current selection to reflect the customer's choice. The function will only successfully execute if the food name matches an item in the list exactly, taking into account the uppercase requirement.\n\n- **Error Handling:** If the food name is not supplied in uppercase or does not match any item in the available food list, the function will not proceed with changing the selection. Instead, it will typically return an error message or code indicating the nature of the issue, such as \"Invalid food item name\" or \"Food item not found.\" This helps guide users to correct the input and resubmit their requests appropriately.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose a customer wants to change their selection to a salad. The function call should look like this:\n\n```plaintext\nchangeFoodSelection(\"SALAD\")\n```\n\nIn this scenario, \"SALAD\" is the correct input because it adheres to the uppercase requirement.

This behavior is useful in applications where consistent data formatting is required, and it helps in easily identifying instances where the LLM was unable to generate a satisfactory response. \n\nFor example, if the LLM produces a response such as \"I'm sorry, I don't have that information\" or \"No answer available,\" this function will interpret such indications as a lack of a viable answer and subsequently return an empty string. This functionality is critical in ensuring that downstream processes or systems relying on this function can seamlessly handle cases of missing or unavailable data without encountering errors or inconsistencies.

Esta tasa puede ser fija o variable, dependiendo de los términos del préstamo. La tasa de interés afecta directamente la cantidad total de intereses pagados a lo largo del plazo del crédito, incrementando o disminuyendo el pago mensual según su valor.\n\nEl \"enganche mínimo\" es el pago inicial que el cliente debe realizar al adquirir el crédito.

Normalization is a technique used to adjust the scale of numerical data to a specific range, typically between 0 and 1, or to standardize it to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This is crucial for many algorithms that are sensitive to differences in scale, such as distance-based models like k-nearest neighbors or gradient descent optimization in neural networks, as it ensures that no single numerical feature dominates the model training simply due to differing scales.\n\nThe second step in the preprocessing process is the encoding of categorical variables. Categorical variables, which represent discrete categories rather than continuous values, must be transformed into a numerical format that can be interpreted by machine learning algorithms. This function handles this transformation through techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding. One-hot encoding creates binary columns for each category within a categorical feature, allowing the model to treat each category as a separate feature. Label encoding, on the other hand, converts each category into an integer value, although care must be taken to ensure that the model does not misinterpret these as ordinal data. \n\nBy applying normalization and encoding, the function ensures that the input data is scaled properly for numerical values and that categorical variables are accurately represented in numerical form. This comprehensive preprocessing prepares the data for machine learning models, allowing for more effective training and improved model performance by ensuring all features are in a compatible and optimized format for analysis.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["data", "normalize", "categories"], "properties": {"data": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "float"}, "description": "A list of numerical values representing the data to be processed.

The `os.system()` function is a straightforward method to execute shell commands, and it is particularly useful for scenarios where you want to automate tasks or execute scripts directly from a Python script. \n\nWhen you call this function, it takes a single argument: a string that represents the command you wish to execute. This command is then passed to the underlying shell for execution. It's important to ensure that the command string is correctly formatted according to the shell's syntax and the Windows environment's requirements, as any syntax errors in the command string might result in execution failure or unintended behavior.\n\nOne key aspect to consider when using this function is that it is blocking, meaning that the Python script will wait until the command has completed its execution before proceeding with the next line of code. This behavior can be advantageous or disadvantageous depending on your specific needs. For instance, if you are executing a command that takes a long time to complete, it might halt the progress of your script until the command finishes.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to handle the security implications of using `os.system()`.

It allows users to run both individual commands and a sequence of commands that can be linked together using the '&&' operator. This chaining capability provided by '&&' ensures that multiple commands can be executed in succession, where each subsequent command is executed only if the preceding command succeeds. This is particularly useful for scenarios that require conditional execution of commands based on the success of earlier commands. The function effectively interfaces with the underlying operating system's command processor, allowing a seamless execution of commands as if they were entered directly into the command prompt. It should be noted that while the function is tailored for Windows environments, the behavior of `os.system()` and the '&&' chaining might differ on non-Windows systems. As a simple example, to run a single command, you might use `os.system('dir')` to list directory contents, and for multiple commands, you could use `os.system('cd folder && dir')` to change directories and then list the contents, assuming 'cd folder' is successful.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

Additionally, since `os.system()` starts a new shell to execute the command, any environment variables or changes to the current directory will not affect the current Python script's environment after the function call completes.\n\nHere's a simple usage example:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Execute a single command\nos.system(\"echo Hello, World!\")\n\n# Execute multiple commands chained with '&&'\nos.system(\"cd C:\\\\ && dir\")\n```\n\nIn the first example, the command `echo Hello, World!` is executed, which simply outputs the string \"Hello, World!\" to the console. In the second example, two commands are executed in sequence: changing the current directory to the root of the C drive (`cd C:\\\\`) and then listing the directory contents using the `dir` command. Note that if the `cd` command were to fail for some reason, the `dir` command would not execute due to the use of '&&'. This chaining mechanism is integral for scripts requiring precise control over command execution flow. \n\nUsers", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

The primary purpose of this function is to allow Python scripts to interact with the system's command line interface, enabling the execution of various command-line utilities and scripts directly from Python code. \n\nThe function can handle the execution of either a single command or multiple commands. When executing multiple commands, they can be chained together using the '&&' operator. This chaining ensures that each command is executed sequentially, with the subsequent command only running if the previous one has been executed successfully. This behavior is particularly useful for scenarios where the outcome of a command is dependent on the successful execution of a preceding command.\n\nFor example, consider a scenario where you want to compile a program and then run it only if the compilation is successful. You can achieve this by chaining the commands as follows: `\"gcc myprogram.c -o myprogram && myprogram\"`. In this example, the program `myprogram` will only be executed if the compilation command `gcc myprogram.c -o myprogram` completes successfully without any errors.\n\nThe `os.system()` function returns the exit status of the command, which can be useful for error detection and handling in scripts. An exit status of `0` typically indicates success, while a non-zero value indicates that an error occurred during command execution. This behavior should be taken into account when designing scripts to ensure robust error handling.\n\nIt is important to note that this function is specific to Windows operating systems, as the behavior and availability of system-level commands can differ across operating systems.

The city should be identified by its commonly recognized name, ensuring that the function accurately locates the intended geographical area.

This parameter allows the function to filter movies specifically associated with the chosen director, showcasing their unique style and contribution to cinema.\n- **Genre**: This parameter specifies the category or type of movie. Whether you're interested in action, comedy, drama, or any other genre, this filter narrows down the list to include only those films that fall within the specified category.\n- **Cast**: A list of actor or actress names whose performances you are particularly interested in. By providing this information, the function will return films that feature the specified cast members, allowing you to explore their work across different films and genres.\n\n#### Functionality:\nUpon execution, the function interacts with a database or data source containing cinematic information.

Secondly, the 'genre' parameter allows users to choose from various categories such as action, drama, comedy, or others, providing a way to narrow down their selection based on thematic content or mood. Lastly, the 'cast' parameter offers the option to specify actors or actresses, thereby tailoring the list to include only those movies where the specified performers have played a role, which could be useful for fans of particular stars or for studying an actor's body of work.\n\nThe function processes these inputs collectively, generating a list of movies that match all the specified criteria. If one or more of the parameters are not provided, the function should handle such cases gracefully by either expanding the search to include any value for that parameter or by returning an appropriate message or empty list if no matches are found.\n\nFor example, a user could call this function with the parameters: director = \"Christopher Nolan\", genre = \"Science Fiction\", and cast = \"Leonardo DiCaprio\".

It operates by filtering a movie database or dataset according to three key parameters: the director, the genre, and members of the cast. \n\nWhen a user calls this function, they need to provide the name of a director, which could be a full name or part of a name, to help narrow down the selection to only those movies directed by the specified individual. Additionally, the user must specify at least one genre. This genre parameter allows the function to further filter the movie list to include only those that fall under the selected category, such as action, comedy, drama, etc. \n\nThe final parameter involves the cast. The user can input the name of one or more actors. The function will then cross-reference the provided names with the actors listed in the cast of each movie, ensuring that only movies featuring at least one of the specified actors are retrieved. \n\nAn important aspect to consider is how the function handles edge cases such as partial matches or misspellings. For instance, if a user enters a director's name that partially matches multiple directors in the database, the function might return movies from all matching directors, or it might require a more precise input. Similarly, if there's an error in the spelling of an actor's name, the function may not return the expected results unless it includes a mechanism for handling such discrepancies or performing fuzzy matching.\n\nA usage example for this function might involve calling it with the parameters: \"Christopher Nolan\" as the director, \"Science Fiction\" as the genre, and \"Leonardo DiCaprio\" as a cast member. The function would then search for movies directed by Christopher Nolan that are categorized under Science Fiction and feature Leonardo DiCaprio in the cast.

The primary purpose of this function is to gather detailed information about each mandate linked to the user in question. The user ID is a mandatory parameter, meaning it must be provided to execute the function successfully. Without this parameter, the function will not be able to determine which user's mandates to retrieve, thus resulting in an error or failure to return any data.\n\nIn addition to the user ID, an optional parameter is available: the status. This parameter allows for additional filtering of the mandates based on their current status. The status parameter is not required for the function to operate, meaning it can be omitted if filtering by status is not necessary for the task at hand. When provided, the status parameter will limit the returned results to only those mandates that match the specified status. This feature is particularly useful for users who need to focus on mandates in a certain state, such as active, pending, or completed.\n\nFor example, if a user wishes to retrieve all mandates regardless of their status, they would call the function with only the user's ID. However, if the user is interested in viewing only those mandates that are currently active, they can supply both the user ID and the status parameter set to \"active.\" The flexibility offered by the optional status parameter allows for more targeted data retrieval, making the function versatile and efficient for various use cases.\n\nOverall, this function is an essential tool for accessing mandate information, giving users the capability to specify exactly which mandates they want to see based on a unique identifier and, optionally, the current status of those mandates.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["user_id"], "properties": {"user_id": {"type": "string", "description": "The unique identifier of the user for whom the mandates need to be fetched."}, "status": {"type": "string", "description": "The current status of the mandates to fetch.

The user ID is a required parameter, while the status is optional and can be used to filter the mandates by their current status.This function is designed to retrieve a comprehensive list of mandates associated with a specific user. To accomplish this, it requires the user’s unique identification number (user ID) as an essential input parameter. This user ID serves as a critical identifier, ensuring that the function fetches mandates specifically tied to the intended user, thereby avoiding any potential mix-ups with mandates belonging to other users.\n\nIn addition to the mandatory user ID, the function offers an optional parameter: the status of the mandates. This optional status parameter acts as a filter, allowing users to narrow down the list of mandates based on their current status. Such statuses could include categories like 'active', 'inactive', 'pending', 'completed', or any other predefined status states relevant to the mandates. By supplying a specific status value, users can efficiently sift through mandates and retrieve only those that match the specified criteria, thus streamlining the data retrieval process and enhancing the function's usability. \n\nIn scenarios where the status parameter is not provided, the function will default to fetching all mandates associated with the user, regardless of their current status.
