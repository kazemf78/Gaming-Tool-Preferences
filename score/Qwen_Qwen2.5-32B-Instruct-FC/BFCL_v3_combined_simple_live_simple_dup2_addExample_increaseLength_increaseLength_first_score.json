It accomplishes this by determining the positions of each hand relative to 12 o'clock and then computes the angle formed between them.\n\n### How the Function Works:\n1. **Input Parameters**: The function requires two input parameters representing the time of interest: \n   - `hour`: An integer value ranging from 0 to 23, representing the hour portion of the time. This allows for calculation in both AM and PM formats.\n   - `minute`: An integer value ranging from 0 to 59, indicating the minute portion of the time.\n\n2. **Position Calculation**:\n   - **Hour Hand Position**: The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours. Therefore, it moves 30 degrees per hour (360 degrees / 12 hours). Additionally, for every minute that passes, the hour hand moves 0.5 degrees (30 degrees / 60 minutes).\n   - **Minute Hand Position**: The minute hand completes a full circle, or 360 degrees, in 60 minutes. Hence, it moves 6 degrees per minute (360 degrees / 60 minutes).\n\n3. **Angle Calculation**:\n   - **Raw Angle**: The function first calculates the absolute difference between the angles of the hour and minute hands.\n   - **Minimal Angle**: Since the clock is circular, the function determines the smaller angle. This is done by taking the minimum between the raw angle and 360 degrees minus the raw angle, ensuring that the angle is always 180 degrees or less.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- **Exact hour**: If the minute is set to zero, the calculation must handle the scenario where the minute hand is at the 12 o'clock position, and the position of the hour hand is straightforwardly `hour * 30` degrees.\n- **Midnight and Noon**: These times are special cases", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"hours": {"type": "integer", "description": "The hour on the clock face."}, "minutes": {"type": "integer", "description": "The minutes on the clock face."}, "round_to": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of decimal places to round the result to, default is 2."}}, "required": ["hours", "minutes"]}}, {"name": "calculate_clock_angle2", "description": "Calculate the angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock at a given time.Example: calculate_clock_angle(hours=3, minutes=15) returns 7.5\n\nExample: calculate_clock_angle(hours=9, minutes=0) returns 90.0\n\nExample: calculate_clock_angle(hours=12, minutes=30, round_to=1) returns 165.0", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"hours": {"type": "integer", "description": "The hour on the clock face."}, "minutes": {"type": "integer", "description": "The minutes on the clock face."}, "round_to": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of decimal places to round the result to, default is 2."}}, "required": ["hours", "minutes"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"calculate_clock_angle1": {"hours": 18, "minutes": 30}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"calculate_clock_angle1": {"hours": 18, "minutes": 30}}], "possible_answer": [{"calculate_clock_angle1": {"hours": [6], "minutes": [30], "round_to": ["", 2]}}, {"calculate_clock_angle2": {"hours": [6], "minutes": [30], "round_to": ["", 2]}}, {"calculate_clock_angle3": {"hours": [6], "minutes": [30], "round_to": ["", 2]}}]}

It then returns the sum of the original purchase amount and the calculated tax, providing the total amount that should be paid by the customer. \n\nThe function takes two primary inputs: the purchase amount and the jurisdiction. The purchase amount is a numeric value representing the cost of goods or services before taxes are applied. This value should be non-negative, as negative values would not typically represent a valid transaction. The jurisdiction input specifies the geographical or regulatory area whose sales tax rules are to be applied. This could be a state, city, or other defined region with its own tax rate, and it determines the percentage rate used in calculating the tax.\n\nInternally, the function multiplies the purchase amount by the sales tax rate associated with the jurisdiction to obtain the tax amount. It then adds this tax amount to the initial purchase amount to arrive at the total amount with tax included. This total is then returned as the output of the function.\n\nUsers should ensure that the jurisdiction provided is valid and supported by the function, as different jurisdictions can have varying tax rates and rules. Additionally, the function assumes that the applicable tax rate for the given jurisdiction is pre-defined and accurate.

Allows for the bulk recording of query classifications in one function call.This function is designed to efficiently manage and record the classification of a large number of queries by associating them with specific intent names. It achieves this by leveraging keyword arguments, where each keyword corresponds to an intent name, and the associated value is a collection of queries that share this intent. By using this approach, users can perform bulk recordings of query classifications in a single function call, significantly streamlining the process.\n\n### Parameters\n\n- **intent_name**: Keyword arguments where each keyword represents the name of an intent. This acts as a label that describes the purpose or goal of the queries associated with it.\n\n- **queries**: The values that accompany each intent name keyword argument. These are the actual queries that need to be classified. They can be provided in various iterable forms, such as lists or tuples, allowing for flexibility in input data structures.\n\n### Functionality\n\nWhen you call this function, it processes each keyword argument, taking the name of the keyword as the intent and the corresponding value as the list of queries. The function then records the association between each query and its intent, effectively classifying them in bulk. This method is particularly useful for applications that require organizing a large number of queries systematically, such as natural language processing tasks, chatbots, or automated customer service systems.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- If no queries are provided for a given intent, the function will simply record the intent with an empty list of queries, ensuring that all intents are processed but without any associated data.\n  \n- If duplicate queries are provided under the same intent, the function will still record each instance, as this might be intentional depending on the use case (e.g., tracking frequency of certain queries).\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\n# Example of how to call the function with multiple intents and their associated queries\nrecord_classifications(\n    greeting=[\"Hello\", \"Hi there\", \"Good morning\"],\n    farewell=[\"Goodbye\", \"See you later\", \"Take care\"],\n    inquiry=[\"What's the weather", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["acc_routing_start", "atm_finder_start", "faq_link_accounts_start", "get_balance_start", "get_transactions_start", "outofscope"], "properties": {"acc_routing_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries requesting the bank routing numbers or account numbers."}, "atm_finder_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for locations of ATMs, specified in the format of 'City, State (abbr)', such as 'Berkeley, CA' or 'New York, NY'."}, "faq_link_accounts_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to linking accounts within the bank's system."}, "get_balance_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for account balances, available funds, or other financial balances."}, "get_transactions_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to viewing transactions, deposits, purchases, and transaction details."}, "outofscope": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries that do not classify to any other available intents."}}}}, {"name": "record2", "description": "Records classifications for a series of queries based on the intent names provided as keyword arguments.

It ensures that the pricing is fair and appropriate for different geographic areas, which might have varying cost structures or demand levels. The calculation method adjusts the service price based on key geographic indicators, potentially including regional tax rates, local economic conditions, or cost-of-living indices. Importantly, the function enforces a minimum price threshold, which guarantees that the service is not offered below a predetermined cost, maintaining a baseline level of profitability or covering essential expenses. This threshold acts as a safeguard to ensure that no matter the geographic adjustments applied, the price will never fall below this minimum value.

The primary goal of this function is to interact with network management systems or APIs to extract information about the nodes, which can include switches, routers, or other networking devices, that are part of a particular fabric. \n\n### Parameters\n\n- **fabric_id**: This is a crucial parameter that uniquely identifies the fabric within the network for which the node information is being requested. It ensures that the correct set of nodes associated with the specified fabric is retrieved. It is important that this parameter is accurately provided in the request to avoid errors or retrieving data from an unintended fabric.\n\n### Usage Example\n\nWhen utilizing this function, it should be integrated into a system where network fabrics are managed, such as a data center configuration management tool or network orchestration service. Below is a hypothetical example of how this function might be called:\n\n```python\n# Assuming 'network_api_client' is an instance of a client capable of making HTTP requests\nfabric_id = \"fabric-12345\"\nnodes_list = network_api_client.get_nodes_by_fabric(fabric_id)\nprint(nodes_list)\n```\n\nIn this example, the function is expected to send a GET request, typically to a RESTful API endpoint, passing the fabric identifier as part of the URL or query parameters. The response, ideally in a structured format like JSON or XML, will contain the list of nodes associated with the specified fabric, which can then be processed or displayed according to the needs of the application.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- **Invalid Fabric ID**: If an incorrect or non-existent fabric ID is provided, the function may return an error response. It is essential to handle such cases by implementing error-checking mechanisms.\n  \n- **Network Errors**: Network issues, such as timeouts or connectivity problems, may prevent the successful execution of the GET request.

These parameters are crucial for accurately determining how much the initial investment will grow over the specified time period.\n\n- **Total Initial Investment**: This parameter represents the amount of money initially invested in the mutual fund. It serves as the principal amount from which the investment will grow, based on the specified yield rate.\n\n- **Annual Yield Rate**: The annual yield rate is expressed as a percentage and signifies the expected rate of return on the investment each year.

It determines how many times the annual yield rate should be applied to the initial investment.\n\nThe function employs the principles of compound interest to calculate the final balance. Compound interest involves reinvesting the earnings each year, so that interest is earned on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous years.

Since this function uses `os.system()`, the return value will be the exit status of the command executed. An exit status of `0` typically indicates success, while any non-zero value indicates an error.\n\nThis function is suitable for executing commands that do not require real-time interaction with the user, as `os.system()` does not provide direct access to input and output streams of the executed command.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

The calculation is based on three crucial parameters: the distance traveled by the vehicle in that year, the type of fuel the vehicle uses, and the fuel efficiency of the vehicle.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n1. **Distance Traveled**: This parameter represents the total number of miles or kilometers the vehicle has traveled in a year. It is a critical factor, as greater distances typically result in higher emissions.\n\n2. **Fuel Type**: The type of fuel the vehicle uses significantly impacts the calculation. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, electric, and hybrid options. Each fuel type has a specific carbon emissions factor, which denotes the amount of carbon dioxide produced per unit of fuel consumed. This emissions factor is essential for accurately estimating the vehicle's carbon footprint.\n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency**: This represents how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel, usually expressed in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). Higher fuel efficiency indicates that the vehicle can travel further on a smaller amount of fuel, potentially reducing the total emissions.\n\n**Calculation Process:**\n\nThe function combines these parameters to estimate the annual carbon dioxide emissions. It considers the distance traveled and divides it by the vehicle's fuel efficiency to determine the total fuel consumed over the year. This result is then multiplied by the carbon emissions factor associated with the selected fuel type to calculate the total emissions in terms of carbon dioxide.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n- If the distance traveled is zero, the function should correctly return zero emissions, as no travel means no fuel consumption or emissions.\n- If the fuel efficiency is excessively high, it could result in minimal emissions even for significant travel distances, which should be correctly processed.\n- Different fuel types with different emissions factors must be handled accurately to reflect real-world differences in carbon output.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\nSuppose a vehicle travels 15,000 kilometers in", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"distance": {"type": "integer", "description": "The distance travelled in miles."}, "fuel_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of fuel used by the vehicle."}, "fuel_efficiency": {"type": "float", "description": "The vehicle's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon."}, "efficiency_reduction": {"type": "integer", "description": "The percentage decrease in fuel efficiency per year (optional).

Each note in the list is represented as a string and follows the traditional order found in music theory, moving stepwise from the starting key note to the octave.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\nWhen using this function, if the user inputs the key \"C major,\" the function would output the C major scale, which is [\"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"G\", \"A\", \"B\"]. This example demonstrates a straightforward application for major scales. For a minor scale, such as \"A minor,\" the function would output [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"G\"].\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\nThis function should correctly handle keys with sharps or flats, such as \"F# major\" or \"Bb minor,\" by accurately adjusting the scale notes to reflect these alterations. Additionally, it should be robust enough to manage invalid input by returning an appropriate error message or exception, guiding the user to provide a valid key input. \n\nBy efficiently identifying the sequence of notes for a specified key, the function serves as an essential tool for musicians, composers, and students of music theory who seek to understand or utilize musical scales in their work.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"key": {"type": "string", "description": "The musical key for which the scale will be found."}, "scale_type": {"type": "string", "default": "major", "description": "The type of musical scale."}}, "required": ["key"]}}, {"name": "musical_scale2", "description": "Get the musical scale of a specific key in music theory.Example: musical_scale(key='C', scale_type='minor') returns ['C', 'D', 'Eb', 'F', 'G', 'Ab', 'Bb']\n\nExample: musical_scale(key='G') returns ['G', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F#']", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"key": {"type": "string", "description": "The musical key for which the scale will be found."}, "scale_type": {"type": "string", "default": "major", "description": "The type of musical scale."}}, "required": ["key"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"musical_scale1": {"key": "C# major"}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"musical_scale1": {"key": "C# major"}}], "possible_answer": [{"musical_scale1": {"key": ["C#", "C sharp"], "scale_type": ["major", ""]}}, {"musical_scale2": {"key": ["C#", "C sharp"], "scale_type": ["major", ""]}}, {"musical_scale3": {"key": ["C#", "C sharp"], "scale_type": ["major", ""]}}]}

This function takes as input a time value, typically represented as a datetime object, along with the source and target time zones. It then adjusts the time accordingly to reflect the difference between the two time zones, accounting for variances such as daylight saving time where applicable.\n\nTo ensure precise conversion, the function relies on a comprehensive database of time zone rules, which includes historical and future changes to time zone offsets. This makes the function robust in handling both standard time and daylight saving time adjustments.\n\nAn edge case to consider is when the conversion falls into a time that does not exist due to the forward clock change during the start of daylight saving time, or a time that occurs twice due to the backward clock change at the end of daylight saving time. The function should handle such scenarios by providing options to specify if the time should be adjusted to the nearest valid time or if an error should be raised.\n\nFor example, suppose the function receives a datetime representing 2:30 AM on March 14, 2023, in the Pacific Standard Time (PST) zone, and the target time zone is Eastern Standard Time (EST).
