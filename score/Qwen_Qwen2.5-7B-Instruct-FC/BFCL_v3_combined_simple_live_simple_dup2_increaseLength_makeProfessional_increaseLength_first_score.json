The inputs to this function are the coefficients 'a', 'b', and 'c', which are necessary to define the quadratic equation.

When the 'root_type' parameter is set to 'real', the function will specifically return only the real roots of the equation. This is most applicable when the discriminant, calculated as b^2 - 4ac, is greater than or equal to zero. This condition ensures that the roots are real numbers.

It takes an input that specifies the food item the customer desires to select. The critical aspect of this function is its adherence to a specific requirement: the name of the food item provided by the customer must be in uppercase letters. This ensures consistency and prevents errors that could arise from case sensitivity in processing food item names.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\n- **Input Requirement:** The function expects the food item name to be passed as a string. It is crucial that this string is entirely in uppercase letters. For example, if a customer wants to select \"pasta,\" the input should be \"PASTA\" instead of \"pasta\" or \"Pasta.\" This requirement is in place to maintain uniformity in how food items are recorded and processed within the system.\n\n- **Selection Process:** Upon receiving the request, the function checks the provided food name against a predefined list of available food items. It confirms that the requested food item exists in the list and then updates the current selection to reflect the customer's choice. The function will only successfully execute if the food name matches an item in the list exactly, taking into account the uppercase requirement.\n\n- **Error Handling:** If the food name is not supplied in uppercase or does not match any item in the available food list, the function will not proceed with changing the selection. Instead, it will typically return an error message or code indicating the nature of the issue, such as \"Invalid food item name\" or \"Food item not found.\" This helps guide users to correct the input and resubmit their requests appropriately.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose a customer wants to change their selection to a salad.

Such processes are fundamental concepts in thermodynamics, often used in the analysis of idealized systems.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **Q**: The heat exchanged during the process, typically measured in joules (J). This parameter is crucial since, for an isothermal process, the entropy change is directly related to the heat transfer.\n- **T**: The absolute temperature at which the process occurs, measured in Kelvin (K). The temperature must remain constant throughout the process for the calculations to be valid. It is critical to ensure the temperature is given in Kelvin, as this is the standard unit in thermodynamics calculations.\n\n#### Details:\nIn the context of an isothermal and reversible process, the change in entropy (\\(\\Delta S\\)) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta S = \\frac{Q}{T}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\Delta S\\) is the change in entropy,\n- \\(Q\\) is the heat absorbed by the system,\n- \\(T\\) is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe function assumes that the process is carried out reversibly, which implies that the system remains in thermodynamic equilibrium throughout the process. This is an idealization that allows for the calculation of entropy changes without additional entropy generation, which would occur in irreversible processes.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- **Zero Heat Exchange**: If \\(Q = 0\\), the entropy change \\(\\Delta S\\) will be zero, indicating no change in the system's disorder.\n- **Negative Heat Exchange**: If the system releases heat (i.e., \\(Q\\) is negative), the entropy change will be negative, signifying a decrease in the system's entropy.\n\n#### Example Usage:\nImagine a scenario where a system absorbs 500 J of heat at a constant temperature of", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"initial_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial temperature in Kelvin."}, "final_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The final temperature in Kelvin."}, "heat_capacity": {"type": "integer", "description": "The heat capacity in J/K."}, "isothermal": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether the process is isothermal.

The GPS coordinates are provided in terms of latitude and longitude, typically expressed in decimal degrees. The function calculates the great-circle distance, which is the shortest distance between two points on the surface of a sphere.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **latitude1, longitude1**: These represent the GPS coordinates of the first location. Both latitude and longitude should be specified in decimal degrees. Latitude values range from -90 to 90 degrees, with positive values indicating north of the equator and negative values indicating south. Longitude values range from -180 to 180 degrees, with positive values indicating east of the Prime Meridian and negative values indicating west.\n\n- **latitude2, longitude2**: These represent the GPS coordinates of the second location, also given in decimal degrees. The constraints on the ranges for latitude and longitude are the same as for the first location.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Invalid Input**: The function assumes valid input ranges for latitude and longitude. If values fall outside the expected ranges, the behavior is undefined and may result in an error or incorrect calculations.\n\n- **Identical Coordinates**: When the two sets of coordinates are the same, the function should return a distance of zero, as there is no spatial separation between the points.\n\n- **Antipodal Points**: When the two points are directly opposite each other on the globe (antipodal), the function should correctly calculate the distance as half the circumference of the Earth.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nTo calculate the distance between New York City (latitude: 40.7128, longitude: -74.0060) and Los Angeles (latitude: 34.0522, longitude: -118.2437), you would call the function like this:\n\n```python\ndistance = calculate_distance(40.7128, -74.0060, 34.0522, -", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"coord1": {"type": "tuple", "description": "The first coordinate as (latitude, longitude).", "items": {"type": "float"}}, "coord2": {"type": "tuple", "description": "The second coordinate as (latitude, longitude).", "items": {"type": "float"}}, "unit": {"type": "string", "description": "The unit of distance.

Conversely, when sorting in descending order, the elements are ordered from the largest to the smallest. This function can handle various types of data within the list, such as numbers or strings, provided that the data types are consistent and comparable. \n\nTo utilize the function, the user typically needs to specify the list to be sorted, and potentially an additional parameter to indicate the desired order type. For example, in many programming languages, a boolean parameter or a keyword argument might be used to toggle between ascending (often the default setting) and descending order. The function must be capable of handling edge cases, such as an empty list, where the output will simply be an empty list as well, or a list with a single element, where the output matches the input since there are no other elements to reorder. Additionally, the function should maintain stability, meaning that equal elements retain their original relative positions in the sorted list. \n\nHere is an example to demonstrate usage: Given a list [3, 1, 4, 1, 5], calling the function with a parameter to sort in ascending order would result in [1, 1, 3, 4, 5].

It plays a crucial role in managing and analyzing how customer inquiries and issues are sorted based on their nature and content. By doing so, it aids in streamlining the process of addressing customer needs and optimizing service efficiency.\n\n### Parameters:\n- **queries**: A list or collection of banking-related queries that need to be categorized. Each query typically involves customer concerns or requests related to banking services, such as account information, transaction issues, or loan inquiries.\n\n- **categories**: A predefined set of categories used to classify the queries. These categories might include topics like \"Account Management,\" \"Loans,\" \"Credit Cards,\" \"Fraud Detection,\" \"Transaction Disputes,\" and \"Online Banking,\" among others.\n\n### Functionality:\n- The function processes each query individually and assigns it to the most appropriate category from the list of predefined categories. This categorization process could involve keyword matching, natural language processing, or other heuristic methods to determine the best fit for each query.\n  \n- Once a query is categorized, it is recorded in a structured data format, such as a database or a log file, which allows for easy retrieval, analysis, and reporting. This enables the organization to track the frequency and types of queries received over time, providing insights into customer needs and service performance.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- Queries that do not fit neatly into any existing category may be flagged for further review or assigned to a general category. It\u2019s important for the function to handle such cases gracefully to maintain the integrity of the categorization process.\n\n- The function should also accommodate updates to the list of categories, allowing for the addition of new categories or refinement of existing ones as banking services and customer concerns evolve.\n\n### Example:\nConsider a scenario where a customer submits a query about a recent fraudulent transaction detected in their account:\n\n```python\nquery = \"I noticed an unauthorized transaction on my account.

By using this function, users can maintain an organized and easily accessible record of how each query is categorized, which can be crucial for analytics, reporting, and improving customer service processes.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **query_id**: A unique identifier for each customer service query. This parameter ensures that each query can be distinctly recognized in the database.\n  \n- **classification**: The category or type assigned to the query. This could include classifications such as 'Billing Issue,' 'Technical Support,' 'General Inquiry,' among others. Accurate classification is essential for effective query management and analysis.\n\n- **timestamp**: A record of the date and time when the classification was made. This helps in tracking the response and resolution times.\n\n#### Returns:\n\nThe function returns a confirmation message or a status code indicating whether the classification recording was successful. It may provide feedback such as 'Success,' 'Error: Invalid Query ID,' or 'Error: Undefined Classification' to inform users of the result of the operation.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose a customer service query with the ID `12345` needs to be classified as a 'Technical Support' issue. The function call might look like this:\n\n```python\nrecord_classification(query_id=12345, classification='Technical Support')\n```\n\nUpon successful execution, the query is logged under the specified classification, ensuring that subsequent analysis or follow-ups can be conducted efficiently. This also aids in trend analysis to pinpoint common customer issues.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Invalid Query ID**: If an unknown or invalid `query_id` is provided, the function should ideally handle this by returning an appropriate error message or status code.\n  \n- **Undefined Classification**: If the classification parameter does not match any pre-defined categories, the function should

It is typically provided as a decimal, where a 5% return would be input as 0.05. The yield rate is crucial as it directly influences the growth of the investment over time.\n\n2. **Investment Amount**: This is the initial sum of money that is invested in the mutual fund. It represents the principal amount upon which the returns will be calculated. The investment amount is essential for determining the scale of the potential returns, with larger investments leading to proportionately higher estimated returns, assuming the same yield rate and time period.\n\n3. **Time Period**: This parameter specifies the duration, usually in years, for which the investment is held in the mutual fund. The time period impacts the compounding effect, where longer durations typically result in greater overall returns due to the exponential growth facilitated by compounding interest.\n\nThe calculation process assumes the concept of compound interest, where the returns are reinvested and generate their own returns over time. This means that each year, the mutual fund's yield is applied not only to the original investment amount but also to the accumulated returns from previous years.\n\nFor example, if an investor puts $10,000 into a mutual fund with an annual yield of 7% for 5 years, the function will estimate the future value of this investment by applying the compound interest formula.

It's important to ensure that the command string is correctly formatted according to the shell's syntax and the Windows environment's requirements, as any syntax errors in the command string might result in execution failure or unintended behavior.\n\nOne key aspect to consider when using this function is that it is blocking, meaning that the Python script will wait until the command has completed its execution before proceeding with the next line of code. This behavior can be advantageous or disadvantageous depending on your specific needs. For instance, if you are executing a command that takes a long time to complete, it might halt the progress of your script until the command finishes.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to handle the security implications of using `os.system()`.

The primary purpose of this function is to allow Python scripts to interact with the system's command line interface, enabling the execution of various command-line utilities and scripts directly from Python code. \n\nThe function can handle the execution of either a single command or multiple commands. When executing multiple commands, they can be chained together using the '&&' operator. This chaining ensures that each command is executed sequentially, with the subsequent command only running if the previous one has been executed successfully. This behavior is particularly useful for scenarios where the outcome of a command is dependent on the successful execution of a preceding command.\n\nFor example, consider a scenario where you want to compile a program and then run it only if the compilation is successful. You can achieve this by chaining the commands as follows: `\"gcc myprogram.c -o myprogram && myprogram\"`. In this example, the program `myprogram` will only be executed if the compilation command `gcc myprogram.c -o myprogram` completes successfully without any errors.\n\nThe `os.system()` function returns the exit status of the command, which can be useful for error detection and handling in scripts.

It is particularly tailored for use within Windows operating systems. The `os.system()` function allows you to run shell commands directly from your Python script. When you have a single command to execute, you can pass it as a string argument to the function. If there are multiple commands that you wish to run in sequence, you should concatenate them into a single string, using '&&' to separate each command.

A batch file allows for more sophisticated command sequences, as it supports conditional operations, looping constructs, and easier debugging. You can write your commands into a .bat file and then execute this file using the same `os.system()` function. This approach not only organizes your commands more neatly but also makes it easier to maintain and modify the task script.\n\nHere's a basic usage example: If you want to create a directory and then navigate into it, you could use the command string `\"mkdir new_folder && cd new_folder\"`. For more complicated operations, write these commands into `task.bat` and execute it with `os.system(\"task.bat\")`. Note that `os.system()` is suitable for simple command execution, but for more advanced process handling, consider using the `subprocess` module, which offers more control and flexibility.\n\nIn summary, this function is a simple and straightforward way to execute shell commands on Windows from a Python script, with the ability to chain commands or run a batch file for more complex requirements.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The Windows command line instruction(s) to be executed.

The AQI is calculated based on the concentrations of various pollutants, such as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide. The retrieved AQI value is typically presented on a scale where lower values indicate better air quality, and higher values suggest poorer conditions, with specific ranges categorized to indicate levels such as 'Good', 'Moderate', 'Unhealthy', etc.\n\nEdge cases to consider include locations with no available data, which should be handled gracefully by the function to avoid errors. The function might return a special value or an error message in such cases. Additionally, the function should account for any potential delays or failures in data retrieval from external sources, implementing appropriate timeout mechanisms or retries.\n\nAn example usage of the function could be as follows: \nSuppose a user wants to retrieve the AQI for Los Angeles, the function may require the user to input the city's name or its geographical coordinates. After processing this input, the function would return the current AQI for Los Angeles, allowing the user to make informed decisions based on the air quality data.\n\nFurthermore, the function should be capable of handling a variety of input formats and provide clear feedback to the user in case of incorrect or incomplete input data.
