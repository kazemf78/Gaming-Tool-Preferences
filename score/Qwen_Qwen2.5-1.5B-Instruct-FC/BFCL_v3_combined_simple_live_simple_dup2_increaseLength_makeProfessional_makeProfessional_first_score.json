The inputs to this function are the coefficients 'a', 'b', and 'c', which are necessary to define the quadratic equation. The coefficient 'a' must be non-zero, as a zero value would make the equation linear rather than quadratic. \n\nThe function also accepts an optional parameter 'root_type'. When the 'root_type' parameter is set to 'real', the function will specifically return only the real roots of the equation. This is most applicable when the discriminant, calculated as b^2 - 4ac, is greater than or equal to zero. This condition ensures that the roots are real numbers.

It essentially performs the task of integration, which is a fundamental concept in calculus used to determine the accumulated value, often representing physical quantities such as area, volume, or total accumulated change over a range.

It takes an input that specifies the food item the customer desires to select. The critical aspect of this function is its adherence to a specific requirement: the name of the food item provided by the customer must be in uppercase letters. This ensures consistency and prevents errors that could arise from case sensitivity in processing food item names.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\n- **Input Requirement:** The function expects the food item name to be passed as a string. It is crucial that this string is entirely in uppercase letters. For example, if a customer wants to select \"pasta,\" the input should be \"PASTA\" instead of \"pasta\" or \"Pasta.\" This requirement is in place to maintain uniformity in how food items are recorded and processed within the system.\n\n- **Selection Process:** Upon receiving the request, the function checks the provided food name against a predefined list of available food items. It confirms that the requested food item exists in the list and then updates the current selection to reflect the customer's choice. The function will only successfully execute if the food name matches an item in the list exactly, taking into account the uppercase requirement.\n\n- **Error Handling:** If the food name is not supplied in uppercase or does not match any item in the available food list, the function will not proceed with changing the selection. Instead, it will typically return an error message or code indicating the nature of the issue, such as \"Invalid food item name\" or \"Food item not found.\" This helps guide users to correct the input and resubmit their requests appropriately.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose a customer wants to change their selection to a salad. The function call should look like this:\n\n```plaintext\nchangeFoodSelection(\"SALAD\")\n```\n\nIn this scenario, \"SALAD\" is the correct input because it adheres to the uppercase requirement.

It plays a crucial role in managing and analyzing how customer inquiries and issues are sorted based on their nature and content. By doing so, it aids in streamlining the process of addressing customer needs and optimizing service efficiency.\n\n### Parameters:\n- **queries**: A list or collection of banking-related queries that need to be categorized. Each query typically involves customer concerns or requests related to banking services, such as account information, transaction issues, or loan inquiries.\n\n- **categories**: A predefined set of categories used to classify the queries. These categories might include topics like \"Account Management,\" \"Loans,\" \"Credit Cards,\" \"Fraud Detection,\" \"Transaction Disputes,\" and \"Online Banking,\" among others.\n\n### Functionality:\n- The function processes each query individually and assigns it to the most appropriate category from the list of predefined categories. This categorization process could involve keyword matching, natural language processing, or other heuristic methods to determine the best fit for each query.\n  \n- Once a query is categorized, it is recorded in a structured data format, such as a database or a log file, which allows for easy retrieval, analysis, and reporting. This enables the organization to track the frequency and types of queries received over time, providing insights into customer needs and service performance.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- Queries that do not fit neatly into any existing category may be flagged for further review or assigned to a general category. It\u2019s important for the function to handle such cases gracefully to maintain the integrity of the categorization process.\n\n- The function should also accommodate updates to the list of categories, allowing for the addition of new categories or refinement of existing ones as banking services and customer concerns evolve.\n\n### Example:\nConsider a scenario where a customer submits a query about a recent fraudulent transaction detected in their account:\n\n```python\nquery = \"I noticed an unauthorized transaction on my account.

By using this function, users can maintain an organized and easily accessible record of how each query is categorized, which can be crucial for analytics, reporting, and improving customer service processes.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **query_id**: A unique identifier for each customer service query. This parameter ensures that each query can be distinctly recognized in the database.\n  \n- **classification**: The category or type assigned to the query. This could include classifications such as 'Billing Issue,' 'Technical Support,' 'General Inquiry,' among others. Accurate classification is essential for effective query management and analysis.\n\n- **timestamp**: A record of the date and time when the classification was made. This helps in tracking the response and resolution times.\n\n#### Returns:\n\nThe function returns a confirmation message or a status code indicating whether the classification recording was successful. It may provide feedback such as 'Success,' 'Error: Invalid Query ID,' or 'Error: Undefined Classification' to inform users of the result of the operation.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose a customer service query with the ID `12345` needs to be classified as a 'Technical Support' issue. The function call might look like this:\n\n```python\nrecord_classification(query_id=12345, classification='Technical Support')\n```\n\nUpon successful execution, the query is logged under the specified classification, ensuring that subsequent analysis or follow-ups can be conducted efficiently. This also aids in trend analysis to pinpoint common customer issues.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Invalid Query ID**: If an unknown or invalid `query_id` is provided, the function should ideally handle this by returning an appropriate error message or status code.\n  \n- **Undefined Classification**: If the classification parameter does not match any pre-defined categories, the function should either prompt for correction or allocate the query to a default 'Uncategorized' group, depending on", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["money_movement_start", "get_transactions_start", "credit_limit_increase_start", "faq_link_accounts_start"], "properties": {"money_movement_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries for transferring funds between accounts."}, "get_transactions_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries for viewing transactions, including deposits, purchases, and transaction details."}, "credit_limit_increase_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of customer requests to increase credit card limits or complaints about the current limit."}, "faq_link_accounts_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries related to linking accounts within the bank's system."}}}}]}, "model_result_raw": "Error during inference: invalid syntax.

This flexible argument structure allows for the dynamic assignment of multiple queries to their respective intent categories.\n\n**Functionality:**\n- The function iterates over each keyword argument, where each key-value pair consists of an intent name as the key and the associated query or queries as the value.\n- It then adds each query to a storage or database mechanism, ensuring that the query is classified under the corresponding intent category specified by the keyword argument key.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n- If a query does not match any specified intent name, it may be necessary to define how such queries are handled\u2014whether they are discarded, flagged, or stored in a general category.\n- The function assumes that the input provided via keyword arguments is correctly formatted with valid intent names and matching queries; improper formatting or invalid intent names might require additional handling to avoid errors.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n```python\nrecord_queries(\n    book_search=\"Find books by Isaac Asimov\",\n    weather_update=\"What's the weather like in New York?\",\n    travel_routes=[\"Best route to Central Park\", \"Shortest route to the airport\"]\n)\n```\nIn this example, the function will categorize the queries into three intent categories: 'book_search', 'weather_update', and 'travel_routes'. Each query is then associated with the appropriate category based on its intent, facilitating organized storage and retrieval.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": [], "properties": {"faq_auto_withdraw_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries about setting up or understanding automatic withdrawals, including benefits and signup instructions.", "default": []}, "payment_information_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries regarding balance checks, due dates for credit cards or other financial accounts.", "default": []}, "pma_income_requirements_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries concerning the income requirements for obtaining mortgages or loans.", "default": []}, "outofscope": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries that do not fit into any other specified intent categories.", "default": []}}}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"pma_income_requirements_start": {}}, {"faq_auto_withdraw_start": {}}, {"payment_information_start": {}}, {"outofscope": {}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"pma_income_requirements_start": {}}, {"faq_auto_withdraw_start": {}}, {"payment_information_start": {}}, {"outofscope": {}}], "possible_answer": [{"record1": {"faq_auto_withdraw_start": [["Can I schedule automatic withdrawals for different dates?"]], "payment_information_start": [["How much do I owe on my home equity loan?"]], "pma_income_requirements_start": [["Can I use bonuses or commissions as part of my income for a loan application?", "Will my income be verified during the loan application process?", "Is there a minimum income threshold for loan approval?"]], "outofscope": ["", []]}}, {"record2": {"faq_auto_withdraw_start": [["Can I schedule automatic withdrawals for different dates?"]], "payment_information_start": [["How much do I owe on my home equity loan?"]], "pma_income_requirements_start": [["Can I use bonuses or commissions as part of my income for a loan application?", "Will my income be verified during the loan application process?", "Is there a minimum income threshold for loan approval?"]], "outofscope": ["", []]}}, {"record3": {"faq_auto_withdraw_start": [["Can I schedule automatic withdrawals for different dates?"]], "payment_information_start": [["How much do I owe on my home equity loan?"]], "pma_income_requirements_start": [["Can I use bonuses or commissions as part of my income for a loan application?", "Will my income be verified during the loan application process?", "Is there a minimum income threshold for loan approval?"]], "outofscope": ["", []]}}]}

It is typically provided as a decimal, where a 5% return would be input as 0.05. The yield rate is crucial as it directly influences the growth of the investment over time.\n\n2. **Investment Amount**: This is the initial sum of money that is invested in the mutual fund. It represents the principal amount upon which the returns will be calculated. The investment amount is essential for determining the scale of the potential returns, with larger investments leading to proportionately higher estimated returns, assuming the same yield rate and time period.\n\n3. **Time Period**: This parameter specifies the duration, usually in years, for which the investment is held in the mutual fund. The time period impacts the compounding effect, where longer durations typically result in greater overall returns due to the exponential growth facilitated by compounding interest.\n\nThe calculation process assumes the concept of compound interest, where the returns are reinvested and generate their own returns over time. This means that each year, the mutual fund's yield is applied not only to the original investment amount but also to the accumulated returns from previous years.\n\nFor example, if an investor puts $10,000 into a mutual fund with an annual yield of 7% for 5 years, the function will estimate the future value of this investment by applying the compound interest formula. It multiplies the original investment by the compound factor, which is calculated using the formula \\( (1 + \\text{yearly yield})^{\\text{time period}} \\).

This method allows the execution of commands directly from the command line interface of the Windows environment. One of the key features of this function is its ability to handle both single commands and multiple commands, which can be executed in succession.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.This function is designed to execute system-level commands specifically on Windows operating systems by utilizing the `os.system()` method from Python's `os` module. The `os.system()` function is a straightforward way to interface with the underlying operating system to run shell commands from within a Python script. This function is capable of executing a single command or multiple commands that are chained together using the '&&' operator. The use of '&&' ensures that the commands are executed sequentially, meaning that each command is only executed if the preceding command is successful (i.e., it returns an exit status of zero). This is particularly useful for constructing command sequences where each step depends on the successful completion of the previous step.\n\nWhen using this function, it is important to be aware of the return value of `os.system()`, which is the exit status of the executed command. A zero return value typically indicates that the command was executed successfully, while a non-zero value signifies an error. Additionally, since `os.system()` starts a new shell to execute the command, any environment variables or changes to the current directory will not affect the current Python script's environment after the function call completes.\n\nHere's a simple usage example:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Execute a single command\nos.system(\"echo Hello, World!\")\n\n# Execute multiple commands chained with '&&'\nos.system(\"cd C:\\\\ && dir\")\n```\n\nIn the first example, the command `echo Hello, World!` is executed, which simply outputs the string \"Hello, World!\" to the console. In the second example, two commands are executed in sequence: changing the current directory to the root of the C drive (`cd C:\\\\`) and then listing the directory contents using the `dir` command. Note that if the `cd` command were to fail for some reason, the `dir` command would not execute due to the use of '&&'. This chaining mechanism is integral for scripts requiring precise control over command execution flow. \n\nUsers", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

This criterion allows users to filter lawyers according to the legal expertise required for their specific issues.\n\nThe fee per hour criterion helps users identify lawyers who charge rates within a desired budget range. This parameter is crucial for clients who need to manage legal expenses effectively and wish to ensure that the lawyers they consider hiring offer services at a cost they are willing to pay.\n\nLastly, the city criterion is employed to narrow down the search to lawyers located in a particular geographic location.

For multiple commands, separate them with '&&'. For complex tasks, create and run a .bat file.This function is designed to execute a specified command within a Windows operating system environment by utilizing the `os.system()` function from Python's `os` module. The `os.system()` function is a simple way to run a command as if it were typed in the command prompt (cmd.exe) interface. It is particularly useful for executing simple, single-line shell commands directly from a Python script. \n\nWhen there is a need to execute multiple commands in sequence, each command should be separated by the '&&' operator. This operator ensures that subsequent commands are executed only if the preceding command completes successfully without errors. For instance, if you want to compile a program and then run it, you could combine the commands into a single string like `\"gcc program.c && a.exe\"`, and pass it to the function for execution.\n\nIn cases where tasks to be executed are complex or involve multiple steps that need to be run as part of a batch process, it is advisable to create a `.bat` file. A batch file can include a series of commands and scripting logic, allowing for more sophisticated task execution than what is possible with a single call to `os.system()`. Once the batch file is created, it can be executed using the same function by simply passing the file path as the command string.\n\nThis approach is specifically tailored for Windows, as the `os.system()` function will call the Windows command-line interpreter.

It operates by filtering a movie database or dataset according to three key parameters: the director, the genre, and members of the cast. \n\nWhen a user calls this function, they need to provide the name of a director, which could be a full name or part of a name, to help narrow down the selection to only those movies directed by the specified individual. Additionally, the user must specify at least one genre. This genre parameter allows the function to further filter the movie list to include only those that fall under the selected category, such as action, comedy, drama, etc. \n\nThe final parameter involves the cast. The user can input the name of one or more actors. The function will then cross-reference the provided names with the actors listed in the cast of each movie, ensuring that only movies featuring at least one of the specified actors are retrieved. \n\nAn important aspect to consider is how the function handles edge cases such as partial matches or misspellings. For instance, if a user enters a director's name that partially matches multiple directors in the database, the function might return movies from all matching directors, or it might require a more precise input. Similarly, if there's an error in the spelling of an actor's name, the function may not return the expected results unless it includes a mechanism for handling such discrepancies or performing fuzzy matching.\n\nA usage example for this function might involve calling it with the parameters: \"Christopher Nolan\" as the director, \"Science Fiction\" as the genre, and \"Leonardo DiCaprio\" as a cast member. The function would then search for movies directed by Christopher Nolan that are categorized under Science Fiction and feature Leonardo DiCaprio in the cast. The output would be a list of movies that meet all these criteria, providing users with a tailored selection based on their preferences. \n\nOverall, this function is a powerful tool for users interested in discovering movies that", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": [], "properties": {"directed_by": {"type": "string", "description": "Director of the movie.

To achieve this, the function requires certain parameters and prerequisites: \n\n1. **Authorization**: The user must be authenticated, and the function should be called with a valid access token. This token is typically obtained through the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework, ensuring that the user has granted permission for the application to control playback on their behalf.\n\n2. **Specification of the Song**: The function needs the unique identifier of the song, known as the Spotify Track URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). This URI acts as a reference to the exact song in Spotify's database, allowing the API to locate and play the correct track.\n\n3. **Active Device Requirement**: The user must have an active device connected to their Spotify account where playback can occur.
