If the LLM does not provide an answer, it returns an empty string.The function is designed to process and interpret the output generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). Its primary objective is to extract and return the answer embedded within the response. The function takes as input the response provided by the LLM, which may contain various elements such as text, metadata, or other structured information.\n\nIf the response includes a valid answer, the function isolates this answer and returns it as a string.

This ensures that the function's output is consistent and predictable, even when the LLM fails to supply an answer.\n\nThe function's ability to return an empty string in the absence of an answer is particularly useful in automated systems or pipelines where subsequent processing steps can continue without interruption, using the empty string as an indicator of no response rather than an error condition.\n\nExample usage of this function might look like this:\n\n```python\nresponse = call_to_llm(prompt)\nanswer = parse_llm_response(response)\nif answer:\n    print(\"The answer provided by the LLM is:\", answer)\nelse:\n    print(\"No answer was provided by the LLM.\")\n```\n\nHere, `call_to_llm(prompt)` is a hypothetical function that sends a prompt to the LLM and receives a response.

The function achieves this by taking the name of the substance and the pressure at sea level as inputs. This information is essential in fields such as chemistry and physics, where understanding the phase transition points of substances under various conditions is crucial.\n\n### Parameters\n\n- **substance_name**: A string that represents the name of the substance whose boiling and melting points are to be retrieved. This parameter is case-insensitive and should be provided in a format that is recognizable by the function, which typically includes common names and scientific names of substances. Examples include 'water', 'iron', or 'ethanol'.\n\n- **sea_level_pressure**: A numerical value representing the atmospheric pressure at sea level in appropriate units, such as atmospheres (atm), Pascals (Pa), or bars. This parameter is crucial because boiling and melting points can vary with changes in atmospheric pressure. By default, standard sea level pressure is considered to be 1 atm.\n\n### Return Values\n\nThe function returns two key pieces of information about the specified substance:\n\n- **Boiling Point**: The temperature at which the substance transitions from a liquid to a gas phase at the specified sea level pressure. This is a critical value, especially in industrial applications where precise temperature control is necessary.\n\n- **Melting Point**: The temperature at which the substance transitions from a solid to a liquid phase at the given sea level pressure. This value is similarly important in processes that involve the solidification or liquefaction of materials.\n\n### Usage Examples\n\n1. **Example with Water**: \n   - Calling the function with `substance_name` set to 'water' and `sea_level_pressure` set to 1 atm will return the boiling point as 100\u00b0C and the melting point as 0\u00b0C, reflecting standard conditions.\n\n2. **Example with Iron**:\n   - When provided with 'iron' as the `", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"substance": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the substance."}, "sea_level": {"type": "integer", "description": "The sea level in meters."}}, "required": ["substance", "sea_level"]}}, {"name": "get_boiling_melting_points2", "description": "Retrieve the boiling point and melting point of a substance based on its name and the sea level.

Entropy, a measure of disorder or randomness in a system, is a fundamental concept in thermodynamics, particularly in understanding energy distribution and efficiency.\n\n### Parameters\n\n- **initial_temperature (T)**: This parameter represents the constant temperature at which the process occurs. It is crucial that this temperature remains constant throughout the process to ensure it is isothermal. The temperature is generally expressed in Kelvin (K) to maintain consistency with thermodynamic calculations.\n\n- **heat_transfer (Q)**: The heat transferred into or out of the system during the process. For a reversible process, this transfer must occur in such a way that the system remains in equilibrium with its surroundings at every stage. The heat transfer is typically measured in joules (J).\n\n### Calculation Details\n\nThe entropy change for an isothermal and reversible process is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta S = \\frac{Q}{T}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\Delta S \\) is the change in entropy.\n- \\( Q \\) is the heat transferred.\n- \\( T \\) is the constant absolute temperature at which the process occurs.\n\n### Edge Cases and Considerations\n\n- **Zero Heat Transfer**: If the heat transfer (\\( Q \\)) is zero, the change in entropy (\\( \\Delta S \\)) will also be zero. This occurs when no energy enters or leaves the system as heat, which could be a hypothetical scenario in a perfectly isolated system.\n\n- **Negative Heat Transfer**: In cases where heat is removed from the system (\\( Q \\) is negative), the entropy change will also be negative, indicating a decrease in the system's disorder as it loses energy.\n\n- **Temperature Constraints**: The function assumes that the input temperature (\\( T \\)) is", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"initial_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial temperature in Kelvin."}, "final_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The final temperature in Kelvin."}, "heat_capacity": {"type": "integer", "description": "The heat capacity in J/K."}, "isothermal": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether the process is isothermal.

The primary purpose of this function is to perform a straightforward arithmetic addition operation, which is a fundamental function in many computational tasks.\n\n#### Parameters\n- **value1**: The first numeric value to be summed. This value can be of any numeric data type, including integers and floating-point numbers. The function will use this as the initial operand in the addition operation.\n  \n- **value2**: The second numeric value to be summed. Like `value1`, this can also be any numeric data type, including integers and floating-point numbers. This value acts as the second operand in the addition operation.\n\n#### Return Value\n- The function returns the result of the addition of `value1` and `value2`. The return type will match the type that can accommodate the result of the addition. For instance, if both inputs are integers, the result will be an integer. However, if at least one input is a floating-point number, the result will be a floating-point number to preserve precision.\n\n#### Edge Cases and Considerations\n- If both input parameters are integers and their sum exceeds the maximum value storable in an integer type, the function should handle this by either returning an error or converting the result to a floating-point number, depending on the language-specific behavior.\n- The function should handle special numeric values such as `NaN` (Not a Number) and `Infinity`. The presence of these values in `value1` or `value2` will result in a return value of `NaN` or `Infinity`, following the rules of arithmetic operations with such values.\n- If the inputs are of mismatched types (e.g., one integer and one floating-point number), the function will implicitly convert the integer to a floating-point number to ensure the operation is carried out correctly.\n\n#### Usage Example\nHere is", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["a", "b"], "properties": {"a": {"type": "float", "description": "The first operand in the summation; a floating-point number."}, "b": {"type": "float", "description": "The second operand in the summation; a floating-point number."}}}}, {"name": "sum2", "description": "Calculate the sum of two numeric values.

This feature is particularly useful for users who need to handle extensive lists of alerts without overwhelming their system resources. The pagination capability allows users to specify the number of alerts to be returned on each page, facilitating easier navigation through the alert data.\n\nThis function operates within a specific time frame, meaning that users can define the start and end time for the alerts they wish to retrieve. This time frame filtering is crucial for focused analysis and ensures that the user receives only the relevant alerts that occurred within the specified period, thereby reducing noise and improving the relevance of the data retrieved.\n\nAdditionally, the function offers optional filtering parameters to further refine the search results. Users can filter alerts by network IDs, which allows them to narrow down alerts to those generated by sensors that are part of specific networks. This is especially beneficial for users managing multiple networks, as it enables them to focus on alerts from particular segments of their infrastructure.\n\nThe function also provides the option to filter by the sensor serial number.

BMI is a widely used indicator that helps assess whether a person has a healthy body weight for a given height. Specifically, it is calculated by dividing an individual's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters (BMI = weight(kg) / height(m)^2). The result is expressed in units of kg/m\u00b2, which is the standard measure for BMI.\n\n### Parameters:\n- **weight (float):** The weight of the person in kilograms. This value should be a positive number, as a non-positive weight does not represent a realistic physical measurement.\n- **height (float):** The height of the person in meters. Similar to weight, this should also be a positive number, and it is important to note that height must be greater than zero to avoid division by zero in the calculation.\n\n### Return Value:\nThe function returns a float value that represents the BMI of the person. This value can be used to interpret the individual's body weight category according to standard BMI classifications. For example, a BMI below 18.5 typically indicates underweight, 18.5 to 24.9 is considered normal weight, 25 to 29.9 is overweight, and 30 or above is classified as obese.\n\n### Usage Example:\n```python\nweight = 70.0  # weight in kilograms\nheight = 1.75  # height in meters\nbmi = calculate_bmi(weight, height)\nprint(f\"The calculated BMI is: {bmi:.2f}\")\n```\n\n### Edge Cases and Considerations:\n- Ensure that both weight and height parameters are validated before calling the function, as negative or zero values will produce incorrect results.\n- The function assumes metric units (kilograms for weight and meters for height).

It requires precise input in terms of both the song title and the artist's name to ensure the correct track is selected and played. Below are the details and examples which illustrate the function's usage:\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **songTitle** (String): This parameter specifies the name of the song you want to play. It must be an exact match to the song's title as listed in the music database or library to ensure successful playback.\n\n2. **artistName** (String): This parameter identifies the artist who performed or recorded the song. Similar to the song title, this must also be an exact match to the artist's name in the database. This is crucial for distinguishing between different artists who may have songs with similar or identical titles.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\n- The function will search the music database or library using the provided `songTitle` and `artistName`.\n- Once a match is found, the function will initiate the playback of the song.\n- If either the song title or artist name does not match any entry in the database, the function might return an error or a message indicating that the song could not be found.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Case Sensitivity**: Depending on the system's configuration, the function might be case-sensitive. Therefore, it is recommended to provide the song title and artist name in the correct case to prevent any issues.\n- **Duplicate Titles**: In situations where multiple songs have the same title by different artists, the artist name becomes critical to ensure the correct track is selected.\n- **Special Characters**: Ensure that any special characters in the song title or artist name are entered correctly, as discrepancies might lead to an inability to find the song.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\n```python\n# Play the song \"Imagine\" by \"John Lennon\"\nplay_song(\"Imagine\", \"John Lennon\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the function is", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["artist_name", "song_name"], "properties": {"artist_name": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the artist whose song is to be played."}, "song_name": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the song to be played."}}}}, {"name": "play_song2", "description": "Plays the specified song by the given artist.

When a customer service query is received, it often needs to be classified into different categories such as billing, technical support, general inquiries, or product feedback. This classification helps streamline the process of addressing customer needs by directing queries to the appropriate department or personnel.\n\nParameters for this function typically include the query itself, which is the content or details of the customer service inquiry that needs classification.

The function should be robust enough to handle these scenarios, potentially through machine learning algorithms, keyword analysis, or a decision-tree approach, to ensure accurate classification.\n\nFor example, if a customer submits a query regarding a billing error, this function would classify the query under the billing or payment-related category. This allows the billing department to promptly address the issue. Conversely, a query about a technical malfunction would be tagged under the technical support category for appropriate handling.\n\nIn summary, this function plays a crucial role in organizing customer service operations by ensuring that each customer query is accurately classified, facilitating efficient and effective customer service delivery.

This function provides the capability to run commands directly in the Windows command shell (cmd.exe), thereby allowing interaction with the operating system's command-line interface from within a Python script.\n\nWhen utilizing this function, users can execute a single command to perform a specific task. For example, a simple command like \"dir\" can be executed to list the directory contents. Additionally, the function supports the execution of multiple commands in a single call by chaining them together using the logical 'AND' operator, denoted by '&&'. This means that several commands can be linked in sequence, where each subsequent command will only execute if the previous command completes successfully. For instance, you could chain commands like \"cd C:\\ && dir\" to change directories and then list the contents of the directory, all within a single invocation of the function.\n\nIt is worth noting that the use of '&&' ensures that the subsequent command only runs if the preceding command returns a successful exit status, which is typically zero in the context of most command-line commands on Windows.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.This function is designed to execute system-level commands specifically on Windows operating systems. By leveraging the `os.system()` function from Python's `os` module, it allows the execution of a command string as if it were typed directly into the command prompt. This functionality is highly useful for automating command-line tasks or integrating system commands into Python scripts.\n\nThe function can handle not only individual commands but also multiple commands that are chained together using the '&&' operator. This chaining mechanism is particularly advantageous when you need to execute multiple commands in sequence and want subsequent commands to run only if the preceding ones succeed. For example, if you want to change the directory and then list its contents, you could pass a command string like `cd my_directory && dir` to the function. This ensures that the `dir` command will only execute if the `cd my_directory` command is successful.\n\nAn important detail to note is that because this function utilizes the `os.system()` method, it is synchronous, meaning the Python script will wait for the command to complete before moving on to execute the next line of code. Therefore, it is advisable to be cautious with commands that might take a long time to execute, as they will block further script execution until they are completed.\n\nWhen using this function, it is essential to ensure that the command string is properly formatted and valid within the Windows command-line environment. Incorrect commands or improper syntax could lead to errors or unintended behavior. Additionally, since this function executes commands at the system level, it requires appropriate user permissions to succeed, especially for commands that modify system settings or require elevated privileges.\n\nIn summary, this function serves as a versatile tool for executing Windows command-line instructions from within a Python script, providing flexibility to run single commands or multiple commands in a controlled sequence using '&&'.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

It takes into account several critical inputs to ensure the contract is suited to the needs of the involved parties. The function requires the user to specify the parties involved in the contract, the type of contract being generated, and the location where the contract will be applied. These inputs are crucial as they directly influence the legal language, clauses, and applicability of the contract.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **Involved Parties**: \n   - This parameter should include detailed information about all parties engaged in the contract. This includes names, roles, and possibly other identifying details necessary to clearly distinguish each party within the legal framework of the contract.\n   - Edge Case: If the number of parties exceeds standard limits or formats, the function should provide an error message or request for further specification.\n\n2. **Contract Type**: \n   - The type of contract is a fundamental input, as it determines the structure and content of the agreement. This could range from employment contracts, service agreements, non-disclosure agreements, to lease contracts, among others.\n   - Edge Case: If the contract type is unrecognized or unsupported, the function should prompt the user to confirm or provide additional information.\n\n3. **Location**: \n   - The location parameter is essential since legal requirements and enforceability can vary significantly between jurisdictions. This includes specifying the country, state, or region where the contract is intended to be valid and enforced.\n   - Edge Case: In case the location falls under multiple legal jurisdictions, the function should clarify or ask for a more precise jurisdiction specification.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\n```python\ngenerate_custom_law_contract(\n    involved_parties=[\n        {\"name\": \"John Doe\", \"role\": \"Employer\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Jane Smith\", \"role\": \"Employee\"}\n    ],\n    contract_type=\"Employment Contract\",\n    location=\"California, USA", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"parties": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "Parties involved in the contract."}, "contract_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of the contract."}, "location": {"type": "string", "description": "Location where the contract will be in effect."}}, "required": ["parties", "contract_type", "location"]}}, {"name": "generate_law_contract2", "description": "Generates a customized law contract given involved parties, contract type and location.

For example, if you need to navigate to a directory and then list the files within that directory, you might provide a command string like \"cd C:\\\\MyFolder && dir\".\n\nHowever, for more intricate tasks that involve a series of commands or require conditional logic, loops, or other complex operations, it is advisable to create a batch file (.bat) containing the necessary commands and logic. You can then execute this batch file through the function, which will, in turn, run the script as if you had executed it manually in the Windows command prompt. This approach is particularly useful for maintaining the readability and organization of your command sequences, as well as for reusing them across different projects or environments.\n\nBy leveraging the capabilities of the `os.system()` function through this approach, you can efficiently integrate system-level operations within your Python applications on Windows, while also keeping your code clean and manageable.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The Windows command line instruction(s) to be executed.

These factors include the total distance the vehicle travels over the course of a year, the type of fuel that it uses, and its fuel efficiency rating.\n\n### Parameters:\n\n1. **Distance Traveled**: This parameter represents the total mileage or distance that the vehicle covers within a year. It is typically measured in miles or kilometers. The greater the distance traveled, the higher the likelihood of increased emissions, assuming all other factors are constant.\n\n2. **Fuel Type**: The type of fuel used by the vehicle is a crucial determinant of its CO2 emissions. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, and alternative fuels such as electric or hybrid options. Each fuel type has a different carbon content and emission factor, affecting the overall emissions calculation.\n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency**: Fuel efficiency is usually measured in terms of miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km). It indicates how effectively a vehicle uses fuel. Vehicles with higher fuel efficiency consume less fuel over the same distance, leading to lower carbon emissions.\n\n### Calculation Considerations:\n\n- **Emission Factors**: The function utilizes predefined emission factors that correspond to each fuel type. These factors represent the average CO2 emissions produced per unit of fuel consumed and are essential for accurate calculation.\n\n- **Conversion Metrics**: The function may require conversion between different measurement units, such as converting kilometers to miles or liters to gallons, depending on the input format.\n\n- **Annual Basis**: The calculation is specifically aimed at determining emissions on an annual basis. It assumes that the provided distance traveled is reflective of the vehicle's yearly usage.\n\n### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose a vehicle travels 15,000 kilometers annually, runs on gasoline, and has a fuel efficiency of 8 liters per 100 kilometers.

It takes a single argument, `query`, which represents the keywords that the user wants to use to find the desired song. These keywords could include the song title, artist name, album, or a combination of these elements.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- `query` (string): This is a required parameter that specifies the search criteria. The function expects a string input that may contain the name of the song, the artist, or any relevant keyword associated with the music track the user wishes to play. The more specific the query, the more accurate the search results will be.\n\n#### Functionality:\n1. **Search Mechanism:** The function initiates a search on the Spotify platform using the provided query. It sends a request to Spotify's search API to retrieve a list of songs that match the given criteria. The search is comprehensive and scans a wide database of music, covering various genres, artists, and albums.\n\n2. **Selection and Playback:** After retrieving the search results, the function selects the most relevant song based on the query. The criteria for selecting the best match could include exact title matches, the popularity of the song, or recency of release. Once the appropriate track is identified, the function sends a command to Spotify to play the song through the user's Spotify account.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- If the query is vague or too broad, the function may return multiple results, and the selection might not always be the user's intended choice.\n- In scenarios where no matches are found for the given query, the function should handle this gracefully, potentially by notifying the user of the issue or suggesting alternative queries.\n- The function assumes that the user is authenticated with Spotify and has an active session for playback to occur. If these conditions are not met, the function should handle authentication errors.\n\n#### Example Usage:\n```", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["query"], "properties": {"query": {"type": "string", "description": "The search query for the song.

This helps in filtering out recipes that require more time than the user can afford, ensuring a quick and efficient cooking experience.\n\n#### Functionality:\nThe function efficiently searches a database or an API to find recipes that meet the outlined dietary needs. It filters the available recipes by cross-referencing them with the specified time constraint, ensuring that only recipes that can be completed within the given time frame are returned. The function returns a list of recipes that the user can choose from, ensuring they are suitable for both their dietary preferences and time limitations.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nSuppose a user needs to find a recipe that is both vegan and can be prepared within 30 minutes. By calling this function with `dietaryNeeds` set to `[\"vegan\"]` and `timeConstraint` set to `30`, the function will return a list of vegan recipes that can be cooked within half an hour.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- If no recipes match the specified dietary needs and time constraint, the function should gracefully inform the user that no matching recipes were found.\n-", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"diet": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["Gluten Free", "Dairy Free", "Vegan", "Vegetarian"]}, "description": "Specific dietary need."}, "time_limit": {"type": "integer", "description": "The maximum time to prepare the recipe in minutes.
