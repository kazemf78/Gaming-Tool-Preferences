It is important to note that this function is restricted to sending just one value at a time, ensuring that the command received is clear and unambiguous. This limitation is particularly useful when precise control is required over the appliance's operations, as it prevents any potential conflicts that could arise from sending multiple commands simultaneously.\n\n### Usage Example\n\nSuppose you are working with a smart home system where you need to adjust the temperature setting on a smart thermostat. Using this function, you can send a specific temperature value, such as 72 degrees Fahrenheit, to the thermostat. The function call would look something like this:\n\n```python\nsend_command_to_appliance(72)\n```\n\nIn this example, `72` represents the single value being sent to control the appliance.\n\n### Parameter Explanation\n\n- **value (int/float/string)**: The command value to be sent to the appliance. This parameter represents the exact instruction the appliance will receive. Depending on the appliance's capabilities, this value could be an integer, a floating-point number, or even a specific string command understood by the appliance.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- **Invalid Values**: If the value sent is not recognized by the appliance, it may result in an error or the appliance may ignore the command altogether. It is crucial to ensure that the value conforms to the expected input range or format for the appliance being controlled.\n- **Network Issues**: In scenarios where the command relies on network communication, issues such as connectivity problems or latency might affect the successful transmission of the command. It is advisable to include error-checking mechanisms to confirm the command was successfully received and executed by the appliance.\n\nOverall, the function provides a streamlined method for issuing a single, distinct command to an appliance, making it an essential tool for tasks that require direct and specific control.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["body"], "properties": {"body": {"type": "dict", "description": "A dictionary containing the parameters for the appliance command.", "properties": {"airConJobMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The current job mode of the air conditioner.", "enum": ["AIR_CLEAN", "COOL", "AIR_DRY"], "default": "COOL"}, "windStrength": {"type": "string", "description": "The strength of the air flow.", "enum": ["LOW", "HIGH", "MID"], "default": "MID"}, "monitoringEnabled": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether air quality sensor monitoring is enabled.", "default": false}, "airCleanOperationMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The operation mode for the air cleaning function.", "enum": ["START", "STOP"], "default": "STOP"}, "airConOperationMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The operation mode for the air conditioner, indicating if it is turned on or off.", "enum": ["POWER_ON", "POWER_OFF"], "default": "POWER_OFF"}, "powerSaveEnabled": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether power save mode is enabled to conserve energy.", "default": false}, "targetTemperature": {"type": "integer", "description": "The target temperature to set for the appliance, in degrees Celsius.", "default": 20}, "relativeHourToStop": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of hours from the current time when the appliance should stop.

It prepares data for machine learning models, ensuring numerical values are scaled properly and categorical variables are appropriately transformed.This function serves as a crucial preprocessing step in the pipeline of preparing data for machine learning models. The primary objective of this function is to transform raw input data into a format that can be effectively used by various machine learning algorithms. It achieves this by performing two key operations: normalization of numerical values and encoding of categorical variables.\n\nThe normalization process involves adjusting the scale of numerical features to ensure that they contribute equally to the model's performance. This is particularly important in cases where the numerical features have varying units or magnitudes. By bringing all numerical values to a consistent scale, often within a range such as [0, 1] or having a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, the function helps prevent any single feature from disproportionately influencing the model due to its scale.\n\nIn addition to normalization, this function also addresses categorical variables, which are non-numeric data types that represent categories or labels. Such variables need to be converted into a numerical form before being fed into machine learning models, as these models typically require numerical input. The function accomplishes this transformation through encoding techniques, such as one-hot encoding or label encoding. One-hot encoding transforms each categorical variable into a binary vector, ensuring that the model can understand and process these variables without assuming any inherent order or relationship. Label encoding assigns a unique integer to each category, which can be useful for certain algorithms that can handle ordinal relationships.\n\nBy performing normalization and encoding, the function ensures that the input data is in an optimal condition for training machine learning models, facilitating better performance and accuracy. This preprocessing step is essential for any data pipeline aiming to extract meaningful insights and predictions from data with diverse characteristics.\n\nExample usage:\nSuppose you have a dataset containing both numerical features, such as age and salary, and categorical features, like country or department.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.This function is designed to execute system-level commands specifically on Windows operating systems by utilizing the `os.system()` method from Python's `os` module. This method provides a way to run commands directly from the command line interface, allowing for the automation and execution of various tasks that would typically be performed manually by a user within the Windows Command Prompt.\n\nThe function is capable of executing a single command, which could range from simple tasks like creating a directory (`mkdir`) or listing files in a directory (`dir`), to more complex operations like launching applications or running scripts. In addition to executing a single command, the function also supports the execution of multiple commands that can be chained together using the '&&' operator. This chaining allows for sequential execution, meaning the subsequent command will only run if the preceding command has completed successfully. For instance, a command string such as `\"mkdir new_folder && cd new_folder && echo 'Hello World' > hello.txt\"` will create a new directory, navigate into it, and then create a text file with a message, executing each step contingent upon the success of the previous one.\n\nIt is important to consider that, when using this function, the commands are executed in the context of the Windows shell, potentially affecting the current directory or environment variables if not carefully managed. Additionally, the return value of `os.system()` is the exit status of the command, where a return value of `0` typically signifies successful execution, while any non-zero value indicates an error occurred during execution.\n\nTo use this function effectively, ensure that the command string is formatted correctly for the Windows environment and that you have the necessary permissions to execute the given commands. Here is an example of how the function might be used:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Example of executing a single command\nos.system('echo Hello World')\n\n# Example of executing multiple chained commands\nos.system('mkdir new_folder && cd new_folder && echo \"Hello World\" > hello.txt')\n```\n\nThis demonstrates how you", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

It is capable of processing and executing not just a single command but also a sequence of commands that are concatenated using the logical AND operator '&&'. \n\nWhen you pass a command or a series of commands to this function, it will initiate a new command shell (cmd.exe) to run the specified instructions.

A return value of 0 typically indicates that the command executed successfully, while a non-zero return value suggests that an error occurred during execution. It is important to note that since this function is intended for use on Windows, it will not behave as expected on other operating systems.

For multiple commands, separate them with '&&'. For complex tasks, create and run a .bat file.The function is designed to execute a specified command by leveraging the `os.system()` function, which is a part of the Python standard library, specifically suited for execution on Windows operating systems. When using this function to execute commands, it is important to note that the commands should be formatted as strings. If you need to execute more than one command in sequence, you should separate each command with the '&&' operator. This will ensure that the subsequent command is executed only if the previous one is successful, which is a common practice in shell scripting to maintain workflow integrity.\n\nFor situations where the task at hand involves more complex operations or a sequence of multiple commands that would be cumbersome to manage directly through `os.system()`, it is advisable to create a batch file, commonly referred to as a `.bat` file. A `.bat` file allows you to script a series of commands that can be executed as a single executable task. This approach not only simplifies the management of multiple commands but also enhances readability and maintainability of the command sequence. Once the `.bat` file is created, you can then run it using the same `os.system()` function to achieve the desired complex task execution.\n\nHere is an example of how this function might be used:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Single command execution\nos.system('echo Hello, World!')\n\n# Multiple commands using '&&'\nos.system('cd C:\\\\SomeDirectory && dir')\n\n# For complex tasks\n# Create a .bat file named task.bat with the following content:\n# @echo off\n# echo This is a complex task\n# dir\n# Then execute it like this:\nos.system('task.bat')\n```\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can effectively use the `os.system()` function on Windows to execute both simple and complex command sequences.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The Windows command line instruction(s) to be executed.

The calculation is based on three primary factors: the distance the vehicle travels in a year, the type of fuel used by the vehicle, and its fuel efficiency.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n1. **Distance Traveled (annual_distance):** This represents the total distance covered by the vehicle over the course of a year. It is usually measured in miles or kilometers, depending on the preferred unit system. Accurate input of this parameter is crucial as it directly influences the resulting emissions calculation.\n\n2. **Fuel Type (fuel_type):** This denotes the type of fuel the vehicle uses. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, natural gas, and electricity. Different fuels emit varying amounts of CO2 when consumed, and this parameter allows the function to use the appropriate emission factor for the calculation. \n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency (fuel_efficiency):** This is a measure of how effectively a vehicle uses fuel, typically expressed in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). Higher fuel efficiency indicates that the vehicle can travel more distance using less fuel, thus producing fewer emissions for the same distance traveled.\n\n**Calculation Process:**\n\nThe core calculation involves determining the total fuel consumption for the given distance based on the vehicle's fuel efficiency. Once the total fuel consumption is established, the function applies the specific emission factor associated with the fuel type to calculate the total CO2 emissions. The emission factor is a standard value that indicates the amount of CO2 released per unit of fuel consumed.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n- **Extreme Values for Distance:** When calculating emissions for vehicles that travel extremely high or low annual distances, ensure that the inputs remain realistic. For instance, commuting vehicles may have significantly lower distances compared to long-haul trucks.\n\n- **Fuel Efficiency Limits:** Consider edge cases where fuel efficiency is unusually high or", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"distance": {"type": "integer", "description": "The distance travelled in miles."}, "fuel_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of fuel used by the vehicle."}, "fuel_efficiency": {"type": "float", "description": "The vehicle's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon."}, "efficiency_reduction": {"type": "integer", "description": "The percentage decrease in fuel efficiency per year (optional).

The ranks usually range from numbers 2 through 10, and include the face cards Jack, Queen, King, and Ace, while the suits consist of Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades.\n\nTo execute this function, it receives two essential parameters: the rank and the suit of the desired card. The rank parameter specifies the numerical or face value of the card, whereas the suit parameter defines the category it belongs to. The function systematically scans the deck, comparing each card's rank and suit with the specified parameters. Upon finding a match, the function identifies the location of the card within the deck.\n\nThis function is particularly useful in scenarios where a specific card needs to be pinpointed quickly within a shuffled or ordered deck. It can be employed in card games, simulations, or any application requiring precise card identification. An edge case might involve searching for a card that is not present in a deck with missing or extra cards, in which case the function should be equipped to handle such exceptions gracefully, typically by indicating the card's absence.\n\nFor example, if one needs to locate the Ace of Spades, the function will be called with the rank parameter set to \"Ace\" and the suit parameter set to \"Spades.\" The expected output would be the position of the Ace of Spades in the deck, provided it is present.

By leveraging location data, the function identifies stores within a specified radius of the user's current location or a provided address. The primary purpose is to cater to users who prioritize organic produce in their shopping choices.\n\n#### Key Features:\n\n- **Location-Based Search:** The function utilizes geolocation services to determine the user's current position or accepts a manually specified location to perform the search. This ensures that the results are relevant and geographically accessible to the user.\n  \n- **Organic Produce Focus:** Specifically tailored for users seeking organic options, the function filters grocery stores to highlight those that offer organic fruits and vegetables. This is particularly useful for individuals committed to maintaining an organic lifestyle.\n\n- **Customizable Criteria:** While the primary focus is on organic fruits and vegetables, the function may also support additional filtering criteria. These could include preferences for certain store types, brands, or other organic product offerings if such details are provided by the user.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Variable Product Availability:** Given that inventory can vary significantly between stores and even within stores over time, the function's results may not always reflect real-time stock levels. Users should verify with the store directly for the most current availability of organic products.\n\n- **Geographic Limitations:** In rural or less populated areas, the number of stores that meet the specified criteria might be limited, resulting in fewer search results. Users in such regions may need to expand the search radius or refine their criteria.\n\n- **Data Accuracy:** The function's effectiveness is contingent upon the accuracy and currency of the store data it accesses. Discrepancies in store listings or outdated information can affect the search results.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nTo use this function, a user might input their current location, either manually or via location services.

In such cases, the function might either skip the item, assume a default price, or raise an error, depending on its design.\n\nUsage example:\nConsider a scenario where a customer wants to purchase 3 units of toothpaste and 2 units of shampoo. The function will access Walmart's pricing data to find the price per unit of toothpaste and shampoo, multiply these prices by the respective quantities (3 and 2), and then add the resulting values to get the total price the customer needs to pay.\n\nParameters of the function may include:\n- `items`: A list or dictionary representing the items to be purchased, where each item is linked with its respective quantity.\n- `quantities`: An optional parameter if quantities are not included in the items list, specifying the number of units for each corresponding item.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"items": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of items to be priced."}, "quantities": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "integer"}, "description": "Quantity of each item corresponding to the items list."}, "store_location": {"type": "string", "description": "The store location for specific pricing (optional).

It operates by determining the city's time zone and calculating the current time based on that information.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `city_name` (string): This parameter represents the name of the city for which the current time is to be retrieved. The value should be a valid city name, typically formatted as a string. It is important to ensure that the city name is correctly spelled and recognized by the function's database or API to return the accurate time.\n\n**Functionality:**\n\nUpon execution, the function accesses a time zone database or API service to locate the time zone corresponding to the provided city name. Once the correct time zone is identified, the function calculates the current time by adjusting for the local time offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). It accounts for variables such as daylight saving time, which may affect the local time in regions that observe it.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n- If an invalid or unrecognized city name is provided, the function should handle the error gracefully, typically by returning a clear error message or a default value indicating the city was not found.\n- The function must be capable of handling cities in countries that have multiple time zones. In such cases, additional logic may be required to distinguish between different cities or regions within the same country.\n- The function should also manage any network issues or API failures in a robust manner, ensuring that it does not crash and provides informative feedback to the user.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\nSuppose a user wants to find out the current time in New York City, they would call the function with the parameter `city_name` set to `\"New York\"`. The function will then return a string or a datetime object representing the current time in New York, adjusted for Eastern Standard Time (EST) or Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), depending on the time of year.\n\n**Output:", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"city": {"type": "string", "description": "The city you want to know the current time for."}, "country": {"type": "string", "description": "The country where the city is located."}, "display_format": {"type": "string", "description": "The time display format: '12h' or '24h'.
