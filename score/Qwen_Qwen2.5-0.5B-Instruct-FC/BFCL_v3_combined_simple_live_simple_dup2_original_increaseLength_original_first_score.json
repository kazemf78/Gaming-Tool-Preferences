It thoroughly examines the response content to identify the specific portion that constitutes the answer intended by the LLM.\n\nIn cases where the LLM successfully includes an answer within its response, the function will isolate and return that segment as its output. The answer is expected to be in a format suitable for the context of the original request, providing clarity and relevance based on the LLM's capabilities.\n\nHowever, there are situations where the LLM might fail to generate a direct answer, either due to the complexity of the query, limitations of the model, or ambiguity in the request.

Its main objective is to analyze the generated answer and determine whether it effectively contains a valid answer or not. In cases where the LLM's response indicates that it does not have sufficient information to provide an answer or explicitly states that no answer is available, the function will return an empty string. This behavior is crucial in applications where distinguishing between a complete response and an acknowledgment of the LLM's limitations is necessary.\n\nTo elaborate on its functionality, the function scans the LLM's reply for any phrases or indicators that suggest the absence of a satisfactory answer. It is designed to recognize common patterns or expressions that are typically used by the model to convey uncertainty or lack of information. Once such indicators are detected, the function will decide to return an empty string, effectively signaling to the calling process that there is no substantive information to act upon.\n\nConsider a scenario where this function is used in a chatbot application. If a user asks a question and the LLM responds with something along the lines of \"I'm not sure,\" \"I don't have the information,\" or similar non-committal phrases, the function will interpret these as indicators that an answer is not adequately available. Consequently, it will output an empty string, allowing the application to handle the situation appropriately, perhaps by prompting the user with alternative actions or inquiries.\n\nIn summary, this function plays an essential role in LLM integration by filtering out non-answers and helps maintain the integrity and reliability of the system by ensuring that only meaningful, content-rich responses are processed further.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["answer"], "properties": {"answer": {"type": "string", "description": "The response provided by the LLM in plain text.

This approach can be particularly beneficial in scenarios where the appliance needs to process each command sequentially to function correctly.\n\nFor example, if you are using this function to adjust the temperature of a smart thermostat, you would call the function once to set a specific value, such as \"72 degrees.\" If you need to make another adjustment, such as changing the fan speed, this would require a separate call to the function with the new desired fan speed value.\n\nOverall, this function provides a straightforward and efficient mechanism for appliance control by adhering to the principle of one command per function call, ensuring that each command is processed independently and accurately.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["body"], "properties": {"body": {"type": "dict", "description": "A dictionary containing the parameters for the appliance command.", "properties": {"airConJobMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The current job mode of the air conditioner.", "enum": ["AIR_CLEAN", "COOL", "AIR_DRY"], "default": "COOL"}, "windStrength": {"type": "string", "description": "The strength of the air flow.", "enum": ["LOW", "HIGH", "MID"], "default": "MID"}, "monitoringEnabled": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether air quality sensor monitoring is enabled.", "default": false}, "airCleanOperationMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The operation mode for the air cleaning function.", "enum": ["START", "STOP"], "default": "STOP"}, "airConOperationMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The operation mode for the air conditioner, indicating if it is turned on or off.", "enum": ["POWER_ON", "POWER_OFF"], "default": "POWER_OFF"}, "powerSaveEnabled": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether power save mode is enabled to conserve energy.", "default": false}, "targetTemperature": {"type": "integer", "description": "The target temperature to set for the appliance, in degrees Celsius.", "default": 20}, "relativeHourToStop": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of hours from the current time when the appliance should stop.

It bases its prediction on the individual's physical measurements, specifically their weight and height.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **Weight**: The weight of the person expressed in kilograms (kg). It is crucial to ensure that the weight is accurate as it significantly influences the likelihood calculation.\n  \n- **Height**: The height of the person provided in meters (m). Accurate measurement is important for reliable predictions.\n\n#### Functionality:\nThe function utilizes weight and height to calculate the body mass index (BMI) of the individual. BMI is a well-known indicator used in medical fields to assess whether an individual falls within a healthy weight range. Since excess body weight is a known risk factor for type 2 diabetes, the BMI result is a critical factor in predicting diabetes likelihood.\n\nThe function applies a statistical model based on existing medical research data to evaluate how these measurements correlate with the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. It uses this model to generate a likelihood score, which can help medical professionals or individuals understand their risk level.\n\n#### Edge Cases and Considerations:\n- Ensure that both weight and height are input in the correct units to avoid inaccuracies in BMI calculation.\n- The model is based on general population data, so individual risk factors beyond weight and height, such as genetic predisposition and lifestyle, are not accounted for in this prediction.\n- It is important to use the likelihood score as a preliminary assessment and follow up with a healthcare provider for comprehensive risk evaluation and advice.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n```python\n# Example: Predict diabetes type 2 likelihood\nweight_kg = 70  # in kilograms\nheight_m = 1.75  # in meters\n\nlikelihood_score = predict_diabetes_type_2_likelihood(weight_kg, height_m)\nprint(f\"The likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes is {likelihood_score}%\")\n``", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"weight": {"type": "integer", "description": "Weight of the person in lbs."}, "height": {"type": "integer", "description": "Height of the person in inches."}, "activity_level": {"type": "string", "enum": ["sedentary", "lightly active", "moderately active", "very active", "extra active"], "description": "Physical activity level of the person."}}, "required": ["weight", "height", "activity_level"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"diabetes_prediction2": {"weight": 150, "height": 5, "activity_level": "lightly active"}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"diabetes_prediction2": {"weight": 150, "height": 5, "activity_level": "lightly active"}}], "possible_answer": [{"diabetes_prediction1": {"weight": [150], "height": [70], "activity_level": ["lightly active"]}}, {"diabetes_prediction2": {"weight": [150], "height": [70], "activity_level": ["lightly active"]}}, {"diabetes_prediction3": {"weight": [150], "height": [70], "activity_level": ["lightly active"]}}]}

It prepares data for machine learning models, ensuring numerical values are scaled properly and categorical variables are appropriately transformed.This function is designed to preprocess the input data, a crucial step in preparing the dataset for machine learning models. The preprocessing involves two primary operations: normalization and encoding of categorical variables. \n\nFirstly, normalization is applied to the numerical values within the dataset. This process adjusts the scale of the numerical data so that it fits within a specific range, usually between 0 and 1, or sometimes between -1 and 1. By scaling the numerical values appropriately, normalization ensures that no individual feature dominates the learning process due to its scale, thereby aiding in the convergence of optimization algorithms and improving the model's performance.\n\nSecondly, the function handles categorical variables by encoding them into a numerical format. Categorical encoding is essential because machine learning algorithms typically require numeric input, and encoding transforms these non-numeric categorical variables into a suitable numerical representation. Common encoding techniques include one-hot encoding, which creates binary columns for each category, and label encoding, which assigns an integer to each category. The choice of encoding technique depends on the specific requirements of the model and the nature of the categorical data.\n\nBy executing these preprocessing steps, the function ensures that the data is in a consistent and model-friendly format. This preparation is critical for the success of machine learning models, as it prevents issues related to varying data scales and non-numeric input. Proper scaling of numerical features helps maintain balance and consistency, while encoding categorical variables allows the model to interpret and utilize these features effectively.

The polynomial function is typically expressed in the standard form of a sum of terms, each consisting of a coefficient and a variable raised to an integer power. For example, a polynomial function could be structured as f(x) = a_n*x^n + a_(n-1)*x^(n-1) + ... + a_1*x + a_0, where each 'a' represents a coefficient of the polynomial.\n\nTo perform the area calculation, the function will require the definition of the polynomial, usually provided as a list or array of coefficients in order of descending powers, and the interval defined by two real number bounds, often denoted as the lower bound and the upper bound. The area computation effectively involves evaluating the definite integral of the polynomial from the lower bound to the upper bound.\n\nIn terms of edge cases, the function should ideally handle cases where the polynomial is constant, ensuring correct area calculation even when the curve is a horizontal line. Additionally, the interval can involve negative bounds, zero, or positive bounds, requiring the function to accurately manage areas below and above the x-axis, recognizing that any area below the x-axis should be considered negative in terms of signed area.\n\nAn example of usage could be calculating the area under the curve for the polynomial f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1 from x = 1 to x = 3. In this scenario, the coefficients of the polynomial are [3, 2, 1], and the interval is [1, 3].

The Random Forest algorithm is a popular ensemble learning technique that constructs a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **data (DataFrame)**: The input dataset on which the Random Forest model will be trained. This dataset should be a structured data format, typically a pandas DataFrame, where each row represents an observation and each column represents a feature or a target variable. It is crucial that the dataset does not contain any missing values and is preprocessed adequately, including normalization or standardization if required.\n\n- **target_column (string)**: The name of the column in the dataset that represents the target variable. This is the column the model will learn to predict, and it should be clearly specified from the rest of the feature columns.\n\n- **n_estimators (int)**: The number of trees in the forest. A larger number of trees typically leads to improved model performance, but also increases computational time. It's advisable to start with a default value, such as 100, and adjust based on performance and resources.\n\n- **max_features (string or int)**: The number of features to consider when looking for the best split. This can be a specific integer, a string like \"auto\" (which uses the square root of the total number of features), or \"all\" (which uses all features). The choice affects the randomness of the model and the correlation between trees.\n\n- **random_state (int, optional)**: Controls the randomness of the bootstrapping of the samples used when building trees. Setting this parameter ensures that the results are reproducible across different runs.\n\n- **criterion (string, optional)**: The function to measure the quality of a split.

Each query string included in a list corresponds to the intent associated with that specific parameter. \n\nThe function facilitates the systematic sorting and storing of queries by intent, ensuring that each query string is classified accurately under the correct intent category. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where queries need to be processed or analyzed based on their underlying intent, such as in natural language processing tasks or customer service automation.\n\nFor example, consider a scenario where you have three intents: \"purchase\", \"support\", and \"feedback\". Each intent would be a parameter to the function, with its value being a list of queries related to that intent:\n\n- `purchase_queries` could include strings like [\"buy shoes\", \"order new phone\"]\n- `support_queries` might contain [\"reset password\", \"troubleshoot wifi issue\"]\n- `feedback_queries` could have entries such as [\"suggestion for improvement\", \"complaint about service\"]\n\nBy providing these lists to the function, queries are effectively categorized, ensuring that each is aligned with the appropriate intent. This structured approach allows for efficient handling of each intent category, which could be useful in various applications, such as customer relationship management, data analysis, or automated response systems.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": [], "properties": {"acc_routing_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries requesting bank routing numbers or account numbers.", "default": []}, "atm_finder_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries asking for ATM locations or to urgently find an ATM for cash withdrawal.", "default": []}, "faq_link_accounts_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries related to linking accounts within the bank's system.", "default": []}, "get_balance_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries requesting account balances, available funds, or other financial balances.", "default": []}, "get_transactions_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries related to viewing transaction details including deposits and purchases.", "default": []}, "outofscope": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries that do not classify under any of the other available intents.", "default": []}}}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"get_balance_start": {"query": "Need ATM location"}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"get_balance_start": {"query": "Need ATM location"}}], "possible_answer": [{"record1": {"acc_routing_start": ["", []], "atm_finder_start": [["Need ATM location"]], "faq_link_accounts_start": ["", []], "get_balance_start": ["", []], "get_transactions_start": ["", []], "outofscope": ["", []]}}, {"record2": {"acc_routing_start": ["", []], "atm_finder_start": [["Need ATM location"]], "faq_link_accounts_start": ["", []], "get_balance_start": ["", []], "get_transactions_start": ["", []], "outofscope": ["", []]}}, {"record3": {"acc_routing_start": ["", []], "atm_finder_start": [["Need ATM location"]], "faq_link_accounts_start": ["", []], "get_balance_start": ["", []], "get_transactions_start": ["", []], "outofscope": ["", []]}}]}

Each parameter represents a different intent and accepts a list of query strings that should be classified under that intent.This function is designed to record classifications for a collection of queries, organizing them according to specified intents. It processes a batch of queries by accepting multiple lists of query strings, where each list is associated with a distinct intent. The parameters of this function are dedicated to those intents, with each parameter corresponding to a separate intent category. For each parameter, you provide a list of query strings that you would like to classify under its respective intent. \n\nFor example, imagine an application that processes customer support queries. This function can be used to classify incoming queries into intents like \"Billing Inquiry\", \"Technical Support\", and \"Product Information\". To do so, each of these intents would be represented by a separate parameter, and the list of queries relevant to each intent would be passed to the corresponding parameter.\n\nThis approach ensures that each query string is systematically classified according to the specified intent, which facilitates efficient organization and processing of data.

This function takes into account a series of future cash flows, a specified discount rate, and the initial investment amount to determine the present value of an investment. \n\nThe NPV function works by discounting each of the future cash flows back to their present value using the discount rate, which reflects the time value of money and investment risk. The initial investment amount is then subtracted from the sum of these discounted cash flows. A positive NPV indicates that the projected earnings, in present dollars, exceed the anticipated costs, thereby suggesting that the investment might be profitable. Conversely, a negative NPV suggests that the investment may result in a loss.\n\n### Parameters:\n- **Future Cash Flows**: This is an array or list of expected cash inflows from the investment over time. These cash flows are typically projected on a yearly basis, but they can also be broken down into other periods, such as quarters or months, depending on the specific analysis requirements.\n  \n- **Discount Rate**: This rate is used to calculate the present value of future cash flows. It accounts for the risk-free rate of return as well as any additional risk premium associated with the investment. The choice of an appropriate discount rate is critical, as it can significantly influence the NPV calculation.\n  \n- **Initial Investment**: This is the upfront cost or expenditure required to start the investment. It is typically a negative number as it represents a cash outflow.\n\n### Usage Example:\nSuppose you have an investment that requires an initial expenditure of $100,000 and is expected to generate cash flows of $30,000, $40,000, $50,000, and $60,000 over the next four years.

This function is particularly useful when you need to run commands that would typically be entered manually in the command prompt or terminal.\n\nThe `os.system()` function takes a string argument, which represents the command or set of commands you wish to execute. For example, if you want to execute a single command, you can simply pass that command as a string to the function. In cases where you need to execute multiple commands in sequence, you can chain them together using the '&&' operator. The '&&' operator ensures that the subsequent command will only execute if the preceding command has been completed successfully without errors.\n\nIt's important to note that since this function utilizes `os.system()`, it behaves synchronously, meaning it will block further execution of the script until the command(s) have finished running. Additionally, `os.system()` returns a status code upon completion, which can be used to determine whether the command was executed successfully. A return value of `0` typically indicates success, while any other value suggests an error occurred during execution.\n\nHere are a few usage examples:\n\n1. Executing a single command:\n   ```python\n   os.system('dir')\n   ```\n   This command will list the directory contents in the command prompt.\n\n2. Executing multiple commands:\n   ```python\n   os.system('cd C:\\\\ && dir')\n   ```\n   This sequence will change the directory to `C:\\` and then list its contents.\n\nKeep in mind that using `os.system()` allows commands to have full access to the underlying system, which carries inherent security risks.

The '&&' operator ensures that each command is executed sequentially, with the subsequent command running only if the preceding command completes successfully.\n\nFor instance, suppose you want to navigate to a directory and then list its contents; you might use the command string `'cd path\\to\\directory && dir'`. Here, the directory change command (`cd`) will be executed first. If it succeeds, the `dir` command, which lists the directory contents, will then be executed. This chaining is particularly useful for executing dependent commands where the failure of one command should prevent the execution of subsequent commands.\n\nHowever, users should be aware of the inherent security risks of executing system-level commands, especially when including dynamically generated input. This function should be used with caution to avoid potential security vulnerabilities such as injection attacks. Additionally, since `os.system()` does not provide a way to capture the standard output or error streams, it is less suitable for scenarios where output retrieval is necessary. For such cases, alternative functions like `subprocess.run()` might be more appropriate.\n\nIn summary, this function serves as an interface for executing Windows command line operations from within a Python script, with support for sequential command execution via '&&', while also highlighting the need for careful usage due to security considerations.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.The function is designed to execute system-level commands specifically within the context of Windows operating systems, utilizing the `os.system()` method provided by Python's standard library. This method enables interaction with the underlying operating system by sending commands directly to the system shell, allowing for a wide range of operations such as file manipulation, program execution, or system configuration changes.\n\nOne key feature of this function is its ability to execute not just a single command, but also multiple commands in sequence. This is achieved through the use of '&&', a logical operator that allows commands to be chained together. When commands are chained using '&&', each command is executed only if the preceding command was successful, i.e., it returned a zero exit status. This ensures that subsequent commands are only executed if previous commands have not encountered any errors, providing a simple error handling mechanism.\n\nFor example, if you need to change directories and then list files within that directory, you could use the function to execute a command string like \"cd C:\\ExampleDirectory && dir\". If the directory change is successful, the directory listing will proceed; otherwise, if the 'cd' command fails, the 'dir' command will not execute.\n\nIt is important to note that since this function relies on the `os.system()` call, it inherits certain limitations and behaviors of this method. For instance, `os.system()` is a blocking call, meaning that the program will wait until the command has completed execution before proceeding. Additionally, it returns the exit status of the command executed, where a return value of zero typically indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates an error.\n\nFurthermore, because it interacts with the system shell, any command passed to this function must be formatted correctly according to shell syntax and must be something that the system shell can interpret and execute. This includes considerations for command-line syntax, escaping special characters, and ensuring that any paths or filenames are correctly specified.\n\nIn summary, this function provides a straightforward mechanism for executing system commands on Windows platforms", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.The function is designed to execute system-level commands specifically on Windows operating systems. It utilizes the `os.system()` method, which is a part of the `os` module in Python, to carry out this task. The `os.system()` function is a straightforward way to run commands as if they were being executed directly in the command prompt of Windows. This can include a wide range of operations, from simple directory listings to more complex command scripts.\n\nA notable feature of this function is its ability to handle multiple commands at once. This is achieved by chaining commands together using the '&&' operator. In the context of command execution, the '&&' operator allows users to run several commands in sequence. The subsequent command will only execute if the preceding command is successful, meaning it returns a zero exit status. This feature is particularly useful for executing a series of dependent commands where the success of one command is required for the next to proceed.\n\nFor example, a user can execute a command string such as `\"dir && echo 'Listed directories'\"`. In this case, the `dir` command will list the contents of the current directory. If this operation is successful, it will proceed to execute the `echo 'Listed directories'` command, which outputs the text 'Listed directories' to the console. This chaining feature enhances the versatility of the function, enabling more complex command sequences to be executed in a controlled manner.\n\nWhen using this function, it is important to handle the commands carefully to avoid any unintended system changes or security vulnerabilities.

It is specifically intended for use on Windows operating systems, ensuring compatibility and proper execution within that environment.\n\nWhen you have a single command to execute, you can simply pass it as a string to this function. For instance, if you need to run a basic command like `dir` to list directory contents, you would pass that string directly.\n\nIn situations where you have multiple commands that need to be executed in sequence, you can combine them into a single string using the '&&' operator. This operator allows you to chain multiple commands together so that they are executed one after the other. For example, if you want to first navigate to a directory using `cd` and then list its contents with `dir`, you could pass the string `\"cd my_directory && dir\"` to the function. The '&&' ensures that the second command will only execute if the first command is successful.\n\nHowever, for more complex tasks that involve numerous commands or intricate logic that might exceed the convenience of a single string, it is recommended to create a batch (.bat) file. A batch file allows you to script a series of commands and control their execution flow with additional features like loops, conditional statements, and variables.

By assigning a unique identifier to each service, users and administrators can easily interact with the system to request, schedule, or modify service details without confusion.\n\nAn example usage of this function might be within a digital platform where clients can book housekeeping services online. When a client selects a service like ironing or cleaning from a list, the function will provide the unique identifier tied to that specific service, ensuring that the correct service is referenced in subsequent operations such as booking confirmation or service adjustment requests.\n\nEdge cases might include situations where the requested service does not exist, where the identifier is null, or where there are duplicate services that need to be differentiated clearly.

It takes a user-provided query as input and utilizes Spotify's search capabilities to find a song that matches the given criteria. Once the search results are obtained, the function selects the most relevant track from the list of possible matches based on the query.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n- **query**: A string that represents the search term or phrase provided by the user. This should ideally include relevant keywords, such as the song title, artist name, or a combination of both, to enhance the accuracy of the search results. It is important for the query to be as specific as possible to minimize ambiguity, especially when searching for songs with common titles or from popular artists.\n\n#### Functionality\n\nUpon receiving the query, the function interfaces with Spotify's API to perform the search operation. The function processes the query string to ensure it is in the appropriate format required for API communication. This might include encoding special characters or managing spaces properly for more efficient searching.\n\nOnce the search request is sent, the function waits for Spotify's API to return a list of tracks that match the search criteria. The API response typically includes a variety of metadata about each track, such as the track name, artist, album, and track ID, among other details. The function then selects the most relevant track from the search results. This selection process could prioritize exact matches or incorporate additional logic to determine the best possible track to play if multiple relevant results are found.\n\nFinally, once the desired track is identified, the function sends a command to Spotify to play the selected song. This involves communicating with Spotify's playback API to control the playback of the track on a device that is logged into the user's Spotify account.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\nConsider a user who wants to listen to the song \"Shape of You\" by Ed Sheeran. They would call the function with the query parameter set to \"Shape of You Ed Sheeran\".

The function takes a search query as an input parameter, which may include details such as the song title, artist name, album name, or other related keywords that are associated with the desired track. Once the query is submitted, the function utilizes Spotify's search capabilities to locate the song that best matches the given input.\n\n### Function Details\n\n- **Input Parameter:**\n  - The function accepts a single input: the `query`, which is a string. This string can be composed of various elements related to the song, including but not limited to the song title, artist name, album, or any combination of these. The more specific the query, the more accurate the search results are likely to be. \n\n- **Search Process:**\n  - Upon receiving the query, the function interfaces with Spotify's search API to perform a lookup. This involves sending the query to Spotify's online database, where it is matched against a vast collection of songs, albums, and artists. The search algorithm considers various factors to determine the best match, such as the relevance of the keywords in the query to the entries in its database.\n\n- **Playing the Song:**\n  - Once the function identifies the song that matches the query, it proceeds to play the song directly through Spotify. This involves initiating playback on the user's default Spotify player or a specified device that is linked to their Spotify account. The function ensures that the song begins playing almost immediately after it is found, providing a seamless experience from search to playback.\n\n### Edge Cases and Considerations\n\n- If the query is too vague or contains inaccuracies, the function might return multiple results or the wrong song.

This conversion process relies on the current exchange rate at the time of execution. The base currency represents the original currency in which the amount is denominated, while the target currency is the currency into which the amount will be converted.\n\nTo achieve this conversion, the function first retrieves the latest exchange rate between the base and target currencies. This rate reflects the value of one unit of the base currency in terms of the target currency. The conversion is performed by multiplying the amount in the base currency by this exchange rate, resulting in the equivalent amount in the target currency.\n\nThe function assumes that the exchange rate is up-to-date and accurate, as it impacts the precision of the conversion. It is important to ensure that the exchange rate data source is reliable and updated frequently to reflect any fluctuations in the currency market.\n\nAn edge case to consider is when either the base currency or the target currency symbols are invalid or not supported by the exchange rate service being used. In such scenarios, the function should handle errors gracefully, possibly by returning a meaningful error message to the user. Additionally, if the current exchange rate is unavailable or cannot be retrieved due to network issues or service outages, the function should account for this by implementing appropriate error-handling mechanisms.\n\nExample usage of the function might involve converting a specific amount of money, say 100 USD (United States Dollars), into EUR (Euro) using the current exchange rate fetched from a reliable financial data source. This showcases the practical application of the function in real-world currency conversion tasks, which are common in international financial transactions, travel budgeting, and e-commerce.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"base_currency": {"type": "string", "description": "The currency to convert from."}, "target_currency": {"type": "string", "description": "The currency to convert to."}, "amount": {"type": "integer", "description": "The amount in base currency to convert"}}, "required": ["base_currency", "target_currency", "amount"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"currency_exchange.convert1": {"base_currency": "CAD", "target_currency": "USD", "amount": 500}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"currency_exchange.convert1": {"base_currency": "CAD", "target_currency": "USD", "amount": 500}}], "possible_answer": [{"currency_exchange.convert1": {"base_currency": ["USD"], "target_currency": ["CAD"], "amount": [500]}}, {"currency_exchange.convert2": {"base_currency": ["USD"], "target_currency": ["CAD"], "amount": [500]}}, {"currency_exchange.convert3": {"base_currency": ["USD"], "target_currency": ["CAD"], "amount": [500]}}]}
