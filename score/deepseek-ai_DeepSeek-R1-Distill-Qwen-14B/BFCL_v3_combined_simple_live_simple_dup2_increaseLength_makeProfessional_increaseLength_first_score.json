It takes an input that specifies the food item the customer desires to select. The critical aspect of this function is its adherence to a specific requirement: the name of the food item provided by the customer must be in uppercase letters. This ensures consistency and prevents errors that could arise from case sensitivity in processing food item names.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\n- **Input Requirement:** The function expects the food item name to be passed as a string. It is crucial that this string is entirely in uppercase letters. For example, if a customer wants to select \"pasta,\" the input should be \"PASTA\" instead of \"pasta\" or \"Pasta.\" This requirement is in place to maintain uniformity in how food items are recorded and processed within the system.\n\n- **Selection Process:** Upon receiving the request, the function checks the provided food name against a predefined list of available food items. It confirms that the requested food item exists in the list and then updates the current selection to reflect the customer's choice. The function will only successfully execute if the food name matches an item in the list exactly, taking into account the uppercase requirement.\n\n- **Error Handling:** If the food name is not supplied in uppercase or does not match any item in the available food list, the function will not proceed with changing the selection. Instead, it will typically return an error message or code indicating the nature of the issue, such as \"Invalid food item name\" or \"Food item not found.\" This helps guide users to correct the input and resubmit their requests appropriately.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose a customer wants to change their selection to a salad. The function call should look like this:\n\n```plaintext\nchangeFoodSelection(\"SALAD\")\n```\n\nIn this scenario, \"SALAD\" is the correct input because it adheres to the uppercase requirement.

The absolute pressure is a crucial measurement in various scientific and engineering applications, as it represents the total pressure exerted on an object, including both the atmospheric pressure and the pressure measured by the gauge. The function works by taking the gauge pressure, which is the pressure relative to atmospheric pressure, and adding it to the atmospheric pressure to obtain the true or total pressure in absolute terms.\n\n### Parameters:\n- **gaugePressure** (float): This parameter represents the gauge pressure, typically measured using a pressure gauge. Gauge pressure is the pressure relative to the ambient atmospheric pressure and is often used in scenarios where the atmospheric pressure is a constant baseline. It is measured in units such as pascals (Pa), pounds per square inch (psi), or bars.\n  \n- **atmosphericPressure** (float): This parameter denotes the atmospheric pressure, which is the pressure exerted by the weight of the atmosphere above the point of measurement. It is essential for calculating absolute pressure and typically has a standard value of approximately 101.3 kPa at sea level. However, this value can vary based on altitude and weather conditions.\n\n### Returns:\n- **absolutePressure** (float): The function returns the absolute pressure, which is the sum of the gauge pressure and the atmospheric pressure. Absolute pressure provides a comprehensive measure of the total pressure exerted on a system and is crucial for accurate calculations in systems where atmospheric pressure variations can impact performance.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- If either the gauge pressure or atmospheric pressure is negative, this might indicate an anomaly or error in measurement, and the function should be used with caution to ensure accurate results.\n- If atmospheric pressure is zero or unreasonably low, it could suggest a vacuum or an incorrect parameter input, potentially leading to an incorrect absolute pressure calculation.\n\n### Usage Example:\n```python\ngaugePressure = 500.0  # in pascals", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"atm_pressure": {"type": "integer", "description": "The atmospheric pressure in atmospheres (atm).

Such processes are fundamental concepts in thermodynamics, often used in the analysis of idealized systems.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **Q**: The heat exchanged during the process, typically measured in joules (J). This parameter is crucial since, for an isothermal process, the entropy change is directly related to the heat transfer.\n- **T**: The absolute temperature at which the process occurs, measured in Kelvin (K). The temperature must remain constant throughout the process for the calculations to be valid. It is critical to ensure the temperature is given in Kelvin, as this is the standard unit in thermodynamics calculations.\n\n#### Details:\nIn the context of an isothermal and reversible process, the change in entropy (\\(\\Delta S\\)) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta S = \\frac{Q}{T}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\Delta S\\) is the change in entropy,\n- \\(Q\\) is the heat absorbed by the system,\n- \\(T\\) is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe function assumes that the process is carried out reversibly, which implies that the system remains in thermodynamic equilibrium throughout the process. This is an idealization that allows for the calculation of entropy changes without additional entropy generation, which would occur in irreversible processes.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- **Zero Heat Exchange**: If \\(Q = 0\\), the entropy change \\(\\Delta S\\) will be zero, indicating no change in the system's disorder.\n- **Negative Heat Exchange**: If the system releases heat (i.e., \\(Q\\) is negative), the entropy change will be negative, signifying a decrease in the system's entropy.\n\n#### Example Usage:\nImagine a scenario where a system absorbs 500 J of heat at a constant temperature of", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"initial_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial temperature in Kelvin."}, "final_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The final temperature in Kelvin."}, "heat_capacity": {"type": "integer", "description": "The heat capacity in J/K."}, "isothermal": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether the process is isothermal.

This calculation considers the position of both hands based on the given hour and minute input. The function takes into account the following rules and scenarios:\n\n1. **Input Parameters**: The function requires two inputs: the hour and the minute. The hour is typically an integer ranging from 1 to 12, representing the conventional 12-hour clock format. The minute is also an integer, ranging from 0 to 59, representing the minutes past the hour.\n\n2. **Hour Hand Calculation**: The position of the hour hand is determined by the given hour and minute. The hour hand moves as the minutes pass, so its position is not fixed to a whole number. Specifically, each hour represents a 30-degree movement from the 12 o'clock position (since 360 degrees divided by 12 hours equals 30 degrees per hour). Additionally, for every minute passed, the hour hand moves an additional 0.5 degrees (since each minute is 1/60th of an hour, and 30 degrees divided by 60 equals 0.5 degrees per minute).\n\n3. **Minute Hand Calculation**: The position of the minute hand is more straightforward, as it is determined solely by the minute input. For every minute, the minute hand moves 6 degrees (since 360 degrees divided by 60 minutes equals 6 degrees per minute).\n\n4. **Angle Calculation**: Once both hand positions are determined, the function calculates the absolute difference between the two angles. Since a clock is circular and the angle could be reflex (greater than 180 degrees), the function also computes the smaller angle between the two, which is the direct angle between the hands. This is done by considering the smaller of the two angles: the calculated angle and 360 degrees minus the calculated angle.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**: The function should handle special cases, such as", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"hours": {"type": "integer", "description": "The hour on the clock face."}, "minutes": {"type": "integer", "description": "The minutes on the clock face."}, "round_to": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of decimal places to round the result to, default is 2."}}, "required": ["hours", "minutes"]}}, {"name": "calculate_clock_angle2", "description": "Calculate the angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock at a given time.This function computes the angular displacement between the hour and minute hands of an analog clock at a specified time.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"hours": {"type": "integer", "description": "The hour on the clock face."}, "minutes": {"type": "integer", "description": "The minutes on the clock face."}, "round_to": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of decimal places to round the result to, default is 2."}}, "required": ["hours", "minutes"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\nThe angle between the hour and minute hands at 6:30 PM is 15 degrees.\n\n```json\n[calculate_clock_angle1(hours=6, minutes=30)]\n```", "possible_answer": [{"calculate_clock_angle1": {"hours": [6], "minutes": [30], "round_to": ["", 2]}}, {"calculate_clock_angle2": {"hours": [6], "minutes": [30], "round_to": ["", 2]}}, {"calculate_clock_angle3": {"hours": [6], "minutes": [30], "round_to": ["", 2]}}]}

To achieve this, the user must provide specific input parameters that define the characteristics of the sine wave to be plotted.\n\nThe first parameter required by the function is the frequency of the sine wave. This parameter determines how many complete cycles the wave will complete in a unit of time or space. A higher frequency implies that the wave oscillates more rapidly, resulting in more cycles within a given range. Conversely, a lower frequency means fewer oscillations and a more extended period for each cycle.\n\nThe second parameter specifies the range over which the sine wave is to be plotted. This range defines the segment of the x-axis that will be used for plotting the wave. It is typically specified as a pair of values indicating the start and end points. The function will calculate the corresponding y-values of the sine wave for each point in this range, given the specified frequency, to generate the plot.\n\nAn edge case to consider is when the range is set to zero or a single point, which would not yield a meaningful plot as no variation would be visible.

It plays a crucial role in managing and analyzing how customer inquiries and issues are sorted based on their nature and content. By doing so, it aids in streamlining the process of addressing customer needs and optimizing service efficiency.\n\n### Parameters:\n- **queries**: A list or collection of banking-related queries that need to be categorized. Each query typically involves customer concerns or requests related to banking services, such as account information, transaction issues, or loan inquiries.\n\n- **categories**: A predefined set of categories used to classify the queries. These categories might include topics like \"Account Management,\" \"Loans,\" \"Credit Cards,\" \"Fraud Detection,\" \"Transaction Disputes,\" and \"Online Banking,\" among others.\n\n### Functionality:\n- The function processes each query individually and assigns it to the most appropriate category from the list of predefined categories. This categorization process could involve keyword matching, natural language processing, or other heuristic methods to determine the best fit for each query.\n  \n- Once a query is categorized, it is recorded in a structured data format, such as a database or a log file, which allows for easy retrieval, analysis, and reporting. This enables the organization to track the frequency and types of queries received over time, providing insights into customer needs and service performance.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- Queries that do not fit neatly into any existing category may be flagged for further review or assigned to a general category. It\u2019s important for the function to handle such cases gracefully to maintain the integrity of the categorization process.\n\n- The function should also accommodate updates to the list of categories, allowing for the addition of new categories or refinement of existing ones as banking services and customer concerns evolve.\n\n### Example:\nConsider a scenario where a customer submits a query about a recent fraudulent transaction detected in their account:\n\n```python\nquery = \"I noticed an unauthorized transaction on my account.

The coefficient of determination is a statistical measure that helps to assess the goodness of fit of the model. It represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. This metric is crucial for evaluating how well the model captures the observed data's variability.\n\nThe function typically requires two main sets of inputs: the observed values of the dependent variable and the predicted values generated by the regression model. These inputs allow the function to quantify how closely the predicted data approximates the actual data. The R-squared value ranges from 0 to 1, where a value of 0 indicates that the model fails to explain any of the variability, while a value of 1 suggests that the model perfectly fits the data.\n\nAn important aspect to note is that a higher R-squared value does not necessarily mean the model is the best choice. It is possible for a model with a high R-squared to lack predictive power or to be overfitting the data. Therefore, while the R-squared is a useful indicator of model performance, it should be used in conjunction with other diagnostic measures.\n\nExample usage of this function might involve passing an array or list of actual values and predicted values to the function, which then returns the calculated R-squared value.

It is typically provided as a decimal, where a 5% return would be input as 0.05. The yield rate is crucial as it directly influences the growth of the investment over time.\n\n2. **Investment Amount**: This is the initial sum of money that is invested in the mutual fund. It represents the principal amount upon which the returns will be calculated. The investment amount is essential for determining the scale of the potential returns, with larger investments leading to proportionately higher estimated returns, assuming the same yield rate and time period.\n\n3. **Time Period**: This parameter specifies the duration, usually in years, for which the investment is held in the mutual fund. The time period impacts the compounding effect, where longer durations typically result in greater overall returns due to the exponential growth facilitated by compounding interest.\n\nThe calculation process assumes the concept of compound interest, where the returns are reinvested and generate their own returns over time. This means that each year, the mutual fund's yield is applied not only to the original investment amount but also to the accumulated returns from previous years.\n\nFor example, if an investor puts $10,000 into a mutual fund with an annual yield of 7% for 5 years, the function will estimate the future value of this investment by applying the compound interest formula. It multiplies the original investment by the compound factor, which is calculated using the formula \\( (1 + \\text{yearly yield})^{\\text{time period}} \\).

The `os.system()` function is a straightforward method to execute shell commands, and it is particularly useful for scenarios where you want to automate tasks or execute scripts directly from a Python script. \n\nWhen you call this function, it takes a single argument: a string that represents the command you wish to execute. This command is then passed to the underlying shell for execution. It's important to ensure that the command string is correctly formatted according to the shell's syntax and the Windows environment's requirements, as any syntax errors in the command string might result in execution failure or unintended behavior.\n\nOne key aspect to consider when using this function is that it is blocking, meaning that the Python script will wait until the command has completed its execution before proceeding with the next line of code. This behavior can be advantageous or disadvantageous depending on your specific needs. For instance, if you are executing a command that takes a long time to complete, it might halt the progress of your script until the command finishes.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to handle the security implications of using `os.system()`. Since it sends the command directly to the shell, there's a risk of shell injection if the command string includes user input without proper sanitization.

The `os.system()` function is a straightforward way to interface with the underlying operating system to run shell commands from within a Python script. This function is capable of executing a single command or multiple commands that are chained together using the '&&' operator. The use of '&&' ensures that the commands are executed sequentially, meaning that each command is only executed if the preceding command is successful (i.e., it returns an exit status of zero).

A zero return value typically indicates that the command was executed successfully, while a non-zero value signifies an error. Additionally, since `os.system()` starts a new shell to execute the command, any environment variables or changes to the current directory will not affect the current Python script's environment after the function call completes.\n\nHere's a simple usage example:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Execute a single command\nos.system(\"echo Hello, World!\")\n\n# Execute multiple commands chained with '&&'\nos.system(\"cd C:\\\\ && dir\")\n```\n\nIn the first example, the command `echo Hello, World!` is executed, which simply outputs the string \"Hello, World!\" to the console. In the second example, two commands are executed in sequence: changing the current directory to the root of the C drive (`cd C:\\\\`) and then listing the directory contents using the `dir` command. Note that if the `cd` command were to fail for some reason, the `dir` command would not execute due to the use of '&&'.

An example of executing a single command might be `os.system('dir')`, which lists the contents of a directory. For multiple commands, an example could be `os.system('cd \\ && dir')`, where the directory is changed to the root using `cd \\` and then the directory contents are listed with `dir`. It is important to note that since this function relies on `os.system()`, it returns the exit status of the command executed, which can be used to determine if the command was successful. If the function is used improperly or if the commands are not valid, it may lead to errors or unexpected behavior.

This parameter allows the function to filter movies specifically associated with the chosen director, showcasing their unique style and contribution to cinema.\n- **Genre**: This parameter specifies the category or type of movie. Whether you're interested in action, comedy, drama, or any other genre, this filter narrows down the list to include only those films that fall within the specified category.\n- **Cast**: A list of actor or actress names whose performances you are particularly interested in. By providing this information, the function will return films that feature the specified cast members, allowing you to explore their work across different films and genres.\n\n#### Functionality:\nUpon execution, the function interacts with a database or data source containing cinematic information. It applies the provided filters \u2014 director, genre, and cast \u2014 to search through the dataset.

Additionally, the user must specify at least one genre. This genre parameter allows the function to further filter the movie list to include only those that fall under the selected category, such as action, comedy, drama, etc. \n\nThe final parameter involves the cast.

Similarly, if there's an error in the spelling of an actor's name, the function may not return the expected results unless it includes a mechanism for handling such discrepancies or performing fuzzy matching.\n\nA usage example for this function might involve calling it with the parameters: \"Christopher Nolan\" as the director, \"Science Fiction\" as the genre, and \"Leonardo DiCaprio\" as a cast member.

This is particularly useful for researchers, marketers, or enthusiasts who want to engage with or analyze leading figures in specific fields.\n\n- **Functionality**: \n  - The function scans Twitter profiles and their associated metadata to determine relevance to the given topics. It then calculates follower counts for each relevant user and identifies the user with the maximum number.\n  - This process involves filtering users based on their bios, tweet content, hashtags, or other topic-related signals.\n\n- **Edge Cases**:\n  - If multiple users have the same number of followers, the function may either return one of them or prioritize based on additional criteria such as engagement metrics or recency of activity.\n  - In the event that no users clearly associated with the specified topics are found, the function should handle this gracefully, possibly returning a null value or a message indicating no relevant users were identified.\n\n- **Usage Example**:\n  - Suppose you are interested in finding the most followed user related to the topic of \"sustainable energy\". You would input \"sustainable energy\" as the topic, and the function would output the Twitter handle of the user with the highest follower count who is active or influential in the sustainable energy conversation.\n\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `topics` (string or list of strings): The specific topics for which the user wants to find the most followed Twitter user.

In Western music, a key signature is a set of sharp or flat symbols placed together on the staff, which indicates the notes that are consistently played higher or lower than the corresponding natural notes, unless otherwise altered by an accidental. Understanding the key signature is crucial for musicians, as it provides insight into the harmonic structure of a piece and helps in interpreting the music as it is written. \n\n#### Parameters:\n- **scale**: A string representing the musical scale for which the key signature is needed. This input should specify whether the scale is major or minor, as the key signature will differ between these two. For example, input may include \"C major\", \"A minor\", \"G major\", etc.\n\n#### Return Value:\nThe function returns a string that represents the key signature of the specified scale. This string will typically indicate the number and type of accidentals (sharps or flats) that comprise the key signature.

The exchange rate represents how much one unit of the base currency is worth in the target currency. By multiplying the base currency amount by the exchange rate, the function determines the current cost or equivalent amount in the target currency.\n\n### Parameters:\n- **amount_in_base_currency**: This parameter signifies the monetary amount in the base currency that you intend to convert.

Special considerations should be taken if the value is zero, as the conversion will yield zero in the target currency.\n  \n- **exchange_rate**: This parameter indicates the exchange rate from the base currency to the target currency. It is a crucial multiplier in the conversion process. An exchange rate value must be greater than zero for a meaningful conversion.

This function takes two primary input parameters: a specific location, which serves as the central point for the search, and a radius, which defines the maximum distance from the location within which the search for parking lots should be conducted. The location can be specified in various formats such as latitude and longitude coordinates, an address, or a point of interest, depending on the implementation. The radius is typically measured in meters or kilometers, although miles may be used in some regions, and it determines the scope of the search area.\n\nWhen invoked, the function processes these inputs to generate a list of parking lots within the defined radius. It identifies the nearest parking lot by calculating the distance from the specified location to each parking facility found within the search area. The output can include details such as the name of the parking lot, its exact location, distance from the specified point, available spaces, pricing, and operational hours, depending on the data available and the level of integration with external systems or databases.\n\nThis function is particularly useful for applications that assist users in finding convenient parking options, such as navigation apps or online maps. Users can leverage this feature to quickly locate the most accessible parking solution, reducing time and effort while optimizing travel plans. Edge cases to consider may include situations where no parking lots are found within the specified radius, in which case the function might return a message indicating no results or suggest expanding the search radius.
