This is one of the sides of the triangle, ideally perpendicular to the height.\n   - Edge Cases: If the base is zero or negative, the area calculation will yield zero or may be deemed invalid in a practical context, as a valid triangle cannot have a zero or negative base.\n\n2. **Height (height):**\n   - Type: A non-negative numeric value.\n   - Description: Represents the vertical height from the base to the opposite vertex of the triangle.

The negative sign does not affect the outcome, as the GCD is always a non-negative integer.\n\n3. **Example 3**: If the inputs are 0 and 5, the GCD is 5. This is because any number is a divisor of zero, and the non-zero integer here is 5.\n\n4. **Example 4**: When both integers are zero, the GCD is defined as 0.

BMI is a numerical value of a person's weight in relation to their height and is commonly used as a general health indicator. This function requires two primary input parameters: the weight of the person, typically in kilograms, and their height, usually in meters. It employs the standard formula for BMI calculation, which is the weight divided by the square of the height (BMI = weight / (height * height)).\n\nThe calculation of BMI provides an estimate of whether a person has a healthy body weight for a given height.

This allows for calculation in both AM and PM formats.\n   - `minute`: An integer value ranging from 0 to 59, indicating the minute portion of the time.\n\n2. **Position Calculation**:\n   - **Hour Hand Position**: The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours. Therefore, it moves 30 degrees per hour (360 degrees / 12 hours). Additionally, for every minute that passes, the hour hand moves 0.5 degrees (30 degrees / 60 minutes).\n   - **Minute Hand Position**: The minute hand completes a full circle, or 360 degrees, in 60 minutes. Hence, it moves 6 degrees per minute (360 degrees / 60 minutes).\n\n3. **Angle Calculation**:\n   - **Raw Angle**: The function first calculates the absolute difference between the angles of the hour and minute hands.\n   - **Minimal Angle**: Since the clock is circular, the function determines the smaller angle. This is done by taking the minimum between the raw angle and 360 degrees minus the raw angle, ensuring that the angle is always 180 degrees or less.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- **Exact hour**: If the minute is set to zero, the calculation must handle the scenario where the minute hand is at the 12 o'clock position, and the position of the hour hand is straightforwardly `hour * 30` degrees.\n- **Midnight and Noon**: These times are special cases", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"hours": {"type": "integer", "description": "The hour on the clock face."}, "minutes": {"type": "integer", "description": "The minutes on the clock face."}, "round_to": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of decimal places to round the result to, default is 2."}}, "required": ["hours", "minutes"]}}]}

This equation is determined by minimizing the error between the predicted and actual values of the target variable, often using techniques such as the least squares method.\n\nWhen using this function, it is important to ensure that the dataset provided does not have missing values in the predictor or target variables, as this could lead to incorrect model parameters. Additionally, the linearity assumption implies that the relationship between the predictor variables and the target variable should be linear, meaning that this method might not be appropriate for datasets with a complex or non-linear relationship.\n\nA typical usage example would involve calling this function with the predictor variables, such as age, height, and weight, to predict a target variable like income. The output would involve the coefficients of the predictors, representing their respective contributions to the target variable, and an intercept, which accounts for the baseline value of the target variable when all predictors are zero.\n\nIn summary, this function is fundamental for predicting a target variable using a linear combination of one or more predictor variables, making it a cornerstone method in statistical modeling and machine learning.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"predictors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "Array containing the names of predictor variables."}, "target": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of target variable."}, "standardize": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Option to apply standardization on the predictors.

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees at training time and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. This method is highly effective in handling both regression and classification tasks and is known for its robustness, accuracy, and ability to manage large datasets with higher dimensionality.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **data**: The input dataset on which the Random Forest model will be trained. This dataset should include both features and target variables. It is essential that the data is preprocessed correctly, with any missing values addressed and categorical variables appropriately encoded. The quality and representation of the input data can significantly impact the performance of the trained model.\n\n- **target_variable**: The specific column or feature within the dataset that the model should predict. This target variable can be categorical or continuous, depending on whether the task is classification or regression, respectively.\n\n- **n_estimators (optional)**: The number of trees in the forest. More trees can improve accuracy but also increase computation time. Typically, users might set this parameter to a default like 100 if not specified otherwise.\n\n- **max_depth (optional)**: The maximum depth of each tree. Limiting the depth of the tree helps prevent overfitting. Setting this to `None` allows nodes to expand until all leaves are pure or contain fewer than `min_samples_split` samples.\n\n- **random_state (optional)**: A seed used by the random number generator. Setting a random state ensures reproducible results by initializing the random number generator in the same state every time the code is run.\n\n#### Returns:\n\n- **model**: The trained Random Forest model object. This object encapsulates the learned patterns and rules from the dataset and can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\n```python", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"n_estimators": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of trees in the forest."}, "max_depth": {"type": "integer", "description": "The maximum depth of the tree."}, "data": {"type": "any", "description": "The training data for the model."}}, "required": ["n_estimators", "max_depth", "data"]}}]}

The t-statistic measures the difference between the group means in units of standard error, while the p-value helps to determine the significance of the results. A low p-value (typically < 0.05) suggests that the observed difference between the means is unlikely to have occurred under the null hypothesis, which states that there is no difference between the group means.\n\nIt is important to note that this test requires certain assumptions to be met: the data should be approximately normally distributed within each group, and the variances of the two groups should be roughly equal. If these assumptions are violated, the results of the test may not be valid. In such cases, alternative methods, such as a Welch's t-test, might be more appropriate.\n\nUsage example:\nSuppose you have two datasets, `group1` and `group2`, each stored in separate arrays. You pass these arrays to the function to perform a t-test, which will return the t-statistic and p-value. Based on the p-value, you can decide whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"array_1": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "integer"}, "description": "First array of data."}, "array_2": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "integer"}, "description": "Second array of data."}, "alpha": {"type": "float", "description": "Significance level for hypothesis testing."}}, "required": ["array_1", "array_2", "alpha"]}}]}

The function is particularly useful in situations where the number of trials and the probability of success in a single trial are known, and you wish to determine the likelihood of observing a specified number of successful outcomes.\n\nTo use this function effectively, you typically need to provide several key parameters: the total number of trials (n), the number of successful outcomes you want to investigate (k), and the probability of success on an individual trial (p).

It typically categorizes two different categorical variables, each having two levels or values, allowing for statistical analysis of whether these two variables are independent or associated.\n\nThe Chi-Squared test for independence is a statistical hypothesis test intended to determine if there is a significant association between the two categorical variables. In this context, the null hypothesis posits that the variables are independent, meaning there is no association between the two. Conversely, the alternative hypothesis suggests that the variables are dependent, indicating some form of association.\n\nThe function computes the test statistic by comparing the observed frequencies in each cell of the table with the expected frequencies under the assumption of independence.

It evaluates the profitability of a project or investment by considering a sequence of future cash flows, a specified discount rate, and the initial capital investment.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **Future Cash Flows**: This parameter represents a series of anticipated cash inflows and outflows over the life of the investment. These cash flows can vary in amounts and are typically listed in chronological order, usually annually, but could also be on a quarterly or monthly basis depending on the specific analysis requirements.\n\n2. **Discount Rate**: This parameter is the rate of return used to discount future cash flows back to their present values. It reflects the opportunity cost of capital or the desired rate of return. The choice of discount rate can significantly affect the calculated NPV, as it accounts for the time value of money, where future money is worth less than present money.\n\n3. **Initial Investment**: This parameter signifies the upfront cost required to commence the investment. It is typically a negative cash flow at the beginning of the investment timeline, representing the outlay of capital necessary for starting the project or acquiring the asset.\n\n#### Calculation:\n\nThe NPV function calculates the present value of each future cash flow by applying the discount rate to each cash flow individually. It then sums these present values and subtracts the initial investment from this sum.

It is typically expressed as a percentage of the bond's face value. The function uses this annual coupon payment to compute the cash flow for each period.\n\n2. **Time Frame (Maturity Period)**: This parameter specifies the total duration, generally in years, over which the bond makes the annual coupon payments before reaching its maturity. Upon maturity, the bondholder is also entitled to receive the bond's face value. The time frame determines the number of periods for which the cash flows need to be discounted.\n\n3. **Discount Rate**: This is a critical input representing the rate of return required by an investor to invest in the bond.

The NPV calculation is fundamental in financial analysis as it aids in determining the value of an investment by discounting future cash flows to their present value, thereby allowing for an assessment of profitability.\n\nTo perform this calculation, the function requires a series of cash flows, which are usually represented as a list or an array, where each element corresponds to a cash flow occurring at a specific time period. These cash flows may include both incoming cash, such as revenue, and outgoing cash, such as expenses or initial investments.\n\nThe function also requires an interest rate, often called the discount rate, which is a critical parameter in the NPV calculation. The discount rate reflects the time value of money, risk associated with the investment, and opportunity cost. It's used to discount future cash flows back to their present value, providing a comprehensive view of the project's worth today.\n\nFor each cash flow in the series, the function applies the formula for Net Present Value: NPV = Σ (C_t / (1 + r)^t), where C_t represents the cash flow at time t, r is the discount rate, and t is the time period.

This function is useful for investors who want to forecast the potential returns on their stock investments over a specified period.\n\n- **Investment Amount**: This parameter represents the amount of money initially invested in the stock. It should be provided as a positive numerical value, typically in the relevant currency. Accurate input is crucial as it serves as the base value for subsequent calculations.\n\n- **Annual Growth Rate**: The annual growth rate is the percentage by which the investment is expected to grow each year. This rate should be expressed as a decimal (for example, 5% growth should be input as 0.05). It is important to use consistent and realistic growth estimates based on historical performance or market analysis to obtain meaningful projections.\n\n- **Holding Period in Years**: This parameter indicates the number of years the investment will be held before calculating the projected return.

This calculation helps investors estimate how much their investment could be worth in the future.\n\nParameters:\n1. **Invested Amount**: This is the initial sum of money that the investor allocates to the stock. It is important to ensure that this amount is expressed in the same currency as the expected return to maintain consistency in the calculation.\n  \n2. **Expected Annual Return**: This represents the anticipated percentage increase in the investment's value per year. The return is typically expressed as a decimal fraction. For example, an expected annual return of 5% should be input as 0.05. It is crucial to note that this figure is an estimate, as actual market performance can vary significantly.\n\n3. **Number of Years**: This denotes the duration for which the investment will be held. It should be a positive integer representing the total number of years over which the investment's growth is projected.

It utilizes three primary input parameters: the yearly yield, the investment amount, and the time period. Here is a detailed breakdown of each component involved in the calculation:\n\n1. **Yearly Yield**: This parameter represents the rate of return that the mutual fund is expected to generate annually. It is typically expressed as a percentage. The yearly yield is crucial as it directly impacts the growth rate of the investment over time. For example, a yearly yield of 5% suggests that the fund is projected to grow by 5% each year.\n\n2. **Investment Amount**: This specifies the initial sum of money that is invested in the mutual fund. It is an essential input because the final estimated return is proportional to the amount of capital invested. A higher investment amount will generally result in a higher estimated return, assuming the yield and time period remain constant.\n\n3. **Time Period**: This parameter indicates the duration, usually measured in years, for which the investment is held in the mutual fund. The time period is significant because the effect of compounding can increase the return over longer durations. For instance, leaving the investment for a longer period can lead to a greater cumulative return due to the compounding effect on the yearly yield.\n\nThe function processes these inputs to estimate the total return at the end of the specified time period. It assumes that the yearly yield is consistent throughout the investment period and that there are no additional contributions or withdrawals from the original investment amount during this time.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\nTo understand how this function operates, consider the following example:\n\nSuppose you are assessing the potential return on a mutual fund with a yearly yield of 7%, an initial investment amount of $10,000, and a time period of 5 years.

Compounded interest is a method where the interest amount is added to the principal, and then the subsequent interest is calculated on the new total, which includes previously accumulated interest. This results in exponential growth of the investment or loan over time.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **Principal (P)**: This is the initial amount of money that is either invested or borrowed. It is the base amount on which interest will be calculated. This should be a non-negative number.\n\n2. **Interest Rate (r)**: This represents the percentage at which the principal amount earns interest over each compounding period. It is typically expressed as an annual rate in decimal form. For example, a 5% annual interest rate would be input as 0.05.\n\n3. **Period (n)**: The number of times that interest is compounded per year. This is usually a positive integer. Common compounding intervals include annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, daily, etc. The choice of compounding period significantly affects the amount of interest accrued over time.\n\n#### Return Value:\n\nThe function returns the total compounded amount after applying the interest for the given period. This amount consists of the original principal plus the accumulated interest.\n\n#### Formula:\n\nThe formula used to calculate the compounded interest is:\n\\[ A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt} \\]\nwhere:\n- \\( A \\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- \\( P \\) is the principal amount (the initial deposit or loan amount).\n- \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n- \\( n \\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per unit year.\n- \\( t \\) is the number of years the money is invested or borrowed", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"principal": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial principal."}, "interest_rate": {"type": "float", "description": "The annual interest rate."}, "period": {"type": "integer", "description": "The period in years."}, "compounding_frequency": {"type": "string", "description": "The frequency of compounding per year.

Higher input or weight increases firing rate and higher decay rate decreases it.The function calculates the neuronal activity, specifically focusing on determining the rate of firing of a neuron. To achieve this, the function takes into account three primary parameters: the input synaptic rate, the weight of inputs, and the decay rate. The input synaptic rate represents the frequency or rate at which synaptic inputs are received by the neuron. This parameter directly influences the firing rate, such that a higher input synaptic rate generally results in an increased neuronal firing rate.\n\nAdditionally, the weight of inputs is a crucial parameter in this calculation. It refers to the strength or significance of each synaptic input to the neuron's overall activity. A higher weight indicates that the input has a greater influence on the neuron's firing rate, thereby increasing it. This parameter can be thought of as the efficiency or effectiveness of the synaptic inputs in triggering neuronal activity.\n\nOn the other hand, the decay rate plays a counterbalancing role in this calculation. It represents a measure of how quickly the effects of synaptic inputs diminish over time. A higher decay rate implies that the influence of the inputs decreases more rapidly, leading to a reduced firing rate of the neuron. Thus, while increased input synaptic rate and input weight tend to enhance the firing rate, the decay rate works to moderate or decrease it.\n\nIn summary, the function integrates these three parameters—input synaptic rate, weight of inputs, and decay rate—to compute the overall firing rate of a neuron. By adjusting these values, one can model different neuronal firing behaviors and understand how varying levels of input and synaptic strength, as well as decay, influence neuronal activity.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"input_synaptic_rate": {"type": "integer", "description": "The synaptic input rate, usually represented as number of inputs per second."}, "weight": {"type": "float", "description": "The weight of the input, denoting its influence on the neuron's state.

By considering these elements, the function provides insights into how group members communicate, collaborate, and influence one another.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **Personality Traits**: This parameter represents a collection of attributes that describe the individual characteristics of each group member. These traits can include a wide range of psychological and behavioral aspects such as extroversion, agreeableness, openness, conscientiousness, and emotional stability. The function utilizes these traits to predict potential interactions and relationship dynamics within the group.\n  \n- **Group Size**: This parameter indicates the total number of individuals in the group. The size of the group can significantly impact social interactions. Smaller groups may facilitate more intimate and direct communication, while larger groups might result in more complex social networks with potential for sub-group formations and diverse interaction patterns.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- **Homogeneous Personality Traits**: If all group members share similar personality traits, the function will analyze how this homogeneity affects the dynamics, potentially leading to uniform interaction patterns or reduced conflict.\n  \n- **Diverse Personality Traits**: When group members possess a wide array of differing personality traits, the function examines how this diversity can lead to richer interactions, potential conflicts, or the emergence of natural leaders.\n  \n- **Extremes in Group Size**: For very small groups, the function might highlight intense and frequent interactions between all members. Conversely, in very large groups, it may identify a tendency towards the formation of sub-groups or cliques.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nConsider a scenario where an organization wants to improve team collaboration. By inputting the personality traits of each team member along with the team's size, this function can provide valuable insights. It might suggest strategies for enhancing communication", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"total": {"type": "integer", "description": "The total group size."}, "extroverts": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of extroverted members in the group."}, "introverts": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of introverted members in the group."}}, "required": ["total", "extroverts", "introverts"]}}]}

Here, π (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159, and r represents the radius. The area represents the total number of square units within the boundary of the circle.\n\nThe circumference of a circle, on the other hand, is calculated using the formula 2 * π * r. This formula also employs the constant π and involves multiplying it by twice the radius. The circumference denotes the total length around the edge of the circle.\n\nIt is important to note that the radius must be a positive number for both calculations to be valid. If the input for the radius is zero or negative, the function should handle such cases appropriately, potentially by returning an error message or defaulting to zero for both area and circumference, as a circle with a non-positive radius does not exist in a geometric sense.\n\nUsage Example:\nAssume the radius of the circle is 5 units. By plugging this value into the formulas, the area is calculated as:\nArea = π * (5^2) = 25π ≈ 78.54 square units.\n\nSimilarly, the circumference is determined as:\nCircumference = 2 * π * 5 = 10π ≈ 31.42 units.\n\nIn practice, this function is useful in various applications where understanding the size and boundary length of circular objects is required, such as in engineering, architecture, and everyday scenarios like determining the amount of material needed to cover a circular area.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"radius": {"type": "integer", "description": "The radius of the circle."}}, "required": ["radius"]}}]}

This function is particularly useful for analyzing a cricketer's performance over a defined period or series of games, allowing for a deeper understanding of their batting consistency and effectiveness.\n\n### Parameters:\n\n- **matches**: This parameter is expected to be a list or array-like structure containing the batting scores from the specified past matches. Each element within this list represents the cricketer's score in an individual match. The function will iterate through this collection to aggregate the total batting scores, which will then be used to compute the average.\n\n### Functionality and Edge Cases:\n\n1. **Calculating the Average**: \n   - The function sums up all the scores from the provided list of matches and divides this total by the number of matches to obtain the average batting score.\n   \n2. **Handling Edge Cases**:\n   - If the list of matches is empty, the function should handle this gracefully, potentially by returning `0`, `undefined`, or a specific message indicating that no matches were provided. This prevents division by zero errors and provides meaningful feedback to the user.\n   - If any of the scores are invalid (e.g., non-numeric values), the function should either ignore such values or raise an error, depending on the intended robustness and error-handling strategy.\n   - The function might need to account for matches where the player did not bat. In such cases, a convention (such as a score of `0` or `null`) should be decided upon for how these scores are represented in the input list.\n\n### Usage Example:\n\nHere is a basic example of how the `getAverageBattingScore` function can be used:\n\n```python\n# Example list of past batting scores\npast_scores = [50, 30, 100, 0, 75]\n\n# Calculate the average batting score\naverage_score", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"player_name": {"type": "string", "description": "Name of the cricket player."}, "matches": {"type": "integer", "description": "Number of past matches to consider for average calculation."}, "match_format": {"type": "string", "description": "Format of the cricket matches considered (e.g., 'T20', 'ODI', 'Test').

In the classic scenario, each die has six faces, numbered from 1 to 6, and the total possible outcomes for rolling two dice is 36, since each die operates independently. The function determines how likely it is to achieve a particular sum by considering the different combinations of numbers on the dice that can produce that sum.\n\nFor example, if you want to calculate the probability of rolling a sum of 7, you consider the combinations: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), and (6,1). There are six combinations that result in a sum of 7, making it the most common outcome when rolling two dice. To find the probability, the function divides the number of successful combinations by the total number of possible outcomes (36). Hence, the probability of rolling a 7 is 6/36 or 1/6.\n\nIt's important to note edge cases such as the smallest possible sum (2), which can only be achieved with the combination (1,1), and the largest sum (12), achieved with the combination (6,6). These sums have only one combination each, resulting in a probability of 1/36. This function is particularly useful for strategic decision-making in games by helping players understand the likelihood of certain outcomes based on the roll of the dice.\n\nTo use this function effectively, you input the desired sum, and it outputs the probability as a fraction or a decimal.

Blackjack is a popular card game where the main objective is to achieve a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. In a standard game, players compete against the dealer rather than each other, trying to either beat the dealer’s hand or have the dealer bust (go over 21).\n\n#### Key Functionalities:\n1. **Assessing Hand Values**: The function calculates the total value of both the player's and the dealer's hands by summing the values of the individual cards. Special attention is given to the Ace card, which can be counted as either 1 or 11, depending on which value keeps the hand total closest to 21 without busting.\n\n2. **Bust Condition**: If either the player's or dealer's hand exceeds a total of 21, it is considered a ‘bust,’ and the other party automatically wins, provided they have a valid hand. The function ensures that this rule is rigorously applied to determine the winner.\n\n3. **Comparing Hand Values**: In cases where no bust occurs, the function compares the hand values. The hand with a total closer to 21 is determined to be the winner. It also handles the scenario where both hands have the same value, which typically results in a ‘push’ or tie, where neither party wins.\n\n4. **Blackjack Condition**: If a player or dealer achieves a hand value of exactly 21 with their initial two cards (usually an Ace and a 10-value card), it is considered a ‘blackjack,’ and this hand typically beats all other 21-value hands that are not blackjacks. The function incorporates this rule in determining the outcome.\n\n#### Edge Cases Handled:\n- If both the dealer and player bust, the function will determine the winner based on the specific rules of the game implemented, which can vary; generally, this", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"player_cards": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "Cards held by the player."}, "dealer_cards": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "Cards held by the dealer."}, "ace_value": {"type": "integer", "description": "The value considered for the ace card, can be either 1 or 11.", "default": 11}}, "required": ["player_cards", "dealer_cards"]}}]}

It involves comparing each card in the deck against the desired rank and suit until a match is found. This function is particularly useful in card games and simulations where precise card identification is required.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n1. **rank**: This parameter represents the rank of the card you wish to locate. It can be a string or an integer, depending on how ranks are represented in the deck. For example, ranks could be '2', '3', '4', ..., '10', 'Jack', 'Queen', 'King', 'Ace' if using strings, or the respective numerical equivalents if using integers.\n\n2. **suit**: This parameter stands for the suit of the card you are looking for.

The calculation involves determining the number of ways to draw such a hand from a 52-card deck.\n\nTo achieve this, the function first calculates the number of ways to choose a rank for the three-of-a-kind portion of the hand, which can be done in 13 ways (one for each rank). For each chosen rank, there are \\(\\binom{4}{3}\\) ways to select three cards of that rank, since there are four suits in a deck.\n\nNext, the function calculates the number of ways to choose a different rank for the pair portion of the hand, which can be done in 12 ways (since one rank is already used for the three-of-a-kind).

This parameter determines the duration of the booking and can influence room availability and overall cost. The user should ensure that the number of nights aligns with their travel plans.\n\nFinally, the function requires a start date for the booking. This date represents the beginning of the user's stay and helps the hotel determine room availability for the specified period. Users should verify that their chosen start date does not conflict with any other plans or bookings.\n\nBooking a room typically involves checking the availability of the chosen room type at the selected hotel for the specified number of nights starting from the given date. If the room is available, the function will proceed with the booking process, confirming the reservation for the user. If not, it may return an error or prompt the user to modify their parameters.\n\nUsage example:\n```python\nbook_room(room_type=\"double\", hotel=\"Grand Plaza\", nights=3, start_date=\"2023-12-01\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the user is", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"hotel_name": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the hotel."}, "location": {"type": "string", "description": "The city in which the hotel is located."}, "room_type": {"type": "string", "description": "The type of room to be booked."}, "start_date": {"type": "string", "description": "The start date for the booking."}, "nights": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of nights for which the booking is to be made."}}, "required": ["hotel_name", "location", "room_type", "start_date", "nights"]}}]}

This conversion to uppercase is a mandatory requirement, possibly for maintaining consistency, adhering to a database schema, or meeting a specific formatting standard within the application.\n\nWhen the function is called, it receives a food name as input, which is then processed internally to ensure it is in uppercase. This transformation could involve converting all alphabetic characters in the input string to their corresponding uppercase versions, effectively ignoring any initial casing or user input errors related to capitalization. It's crucial for developers or users of this function to provide a valid food name as input, as the function assumes that the input is a legitimate food item intended to be part of the selection process.\n\nThe function could be utilized in various scenarios, such as updating a menu, processing customer orders, or interacting with a backend system that requires uppercase food names for data integrity or processing purposes. To illustrate, if a customer requests a change from \"salad\" to \"pasta,\" the function will convert \"pasta\" to \"PASTA\" before processing the request further.\n\nIn terms of edge cases, it's important to consider situations where the input may already be in uppercase. In such cases, the function will still perform the conversion process, although it will not alter the input.

It prepares data for machine learning models, ensuring numerical values are scaled properly and categorical variables are appropriately transformed.This function is designed to preprocess the input data in preparation for use with machine learning models. It performs two critical tasks: normalization of numerical values and encoding of categorical variables. \n\nFirstly, normalization involves scaling the numerical values within the dataset to a specific range, typically between 0 and 1, or transforming them to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This step is crucial as it ensures that all numerical features contribute equally to the model's learning process, preventing any single feature from having an undue influence due to its scale.\n\nSecondly, the function handles the encoding of categorical variables, which are non-numeric data types that represent categories or labels. Encoding can be done using various techniques, such as one-hot encoding or label encoding. One-hot encoding transforms each category into a new binary column, ensuring that machine learning models can interpret these variables correctly. Label encoding replaces each category with a unique integer, which is suitable for algorithms that can naturally handle categorical data.\n\nBy performing these preprocessing steps, the function ensures that the dataset is in an optimal format for training machine learning models.

The function returns the total amount with tax.The function is designed to compute the applicable sales tax for a specified purchase amount based on the sales tax rate of a particular jurisdiction. When provided with a purchase amount, the function determines the appropriate tax rate according to the given jurisdiction, applies this rate to calculate the sales tax due, and then adds the calculated tax to the original purchase amount. Consequently, the function returns the total amount payable, inclusive of the original purchase amount and the added sales tax.\n\n### Parameters:\n- **purchase_amount (float or int):** The monetary amount of the purchase before tax. It should be a positive numerical value representing the subtotal on which the sales tax will be computed.\n- **jurisdiction (string):** A string identifier for the geographical or political region in which the tax is being applied. This could be a state, province, or country, each having potentially different tax rates.\n\n### Return Value:\n- **total_amount (float):** This value represents the sum of the original purchase amount and the calculated sales tax. It reflects the total cost the buyer will need to pay, inclusive of the applicable sales tax for the specified jurisdiction.\n\n### Example Usage:\nSuppose a purchase is made in a jurisdiction with a sales tax rate of 5%. If the purchase amount is $100, this function will calculate a $5 sales tax, resulting in a total amount of $105 being returned. This ensures that the financial transaction reflects the correct tax obligations as determined by local laws and regulations.\n\n### Edge Cases and Considerations:\n- Ensure that the jurisdiction is correctly specified as the function relies on this to determine the correct tax rate.

For instance, if the input is `10`, the function will return `-10`; similarly, if the input is `-5`, the function will return `5`. The function thus effectively inverts the numeric value, which can be particularly useful in mathematical computations where sign inversion is necessary.\n\nOverall, the function is versatile, capable of handling different data types, and performs distinct operations based on the type of the input. It is important to ensure that the input is of a type that the function is designed to handle, as providing unsupported types could result in unexpected behavior. The function is designed to be straightforward, allowing for seamless integration into larger applications where such reverse or inversion operations are required.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["input_value"], "properties": {"input_value": {"type": "any", "description": "The value to be reversed.

It is particularly useful for automating tasks that would otherwise require manual input in a command prompt window.\n\nThe function can handle both single commands and multiple commands that are chained together using the logical AND operator, represented by '&&'. When multiple commands are chained with '&&', each command is executed sequentially, and execution only continues to the next command if the previous command completes successfully. This behavior can be particularly beneficial in scenarios where the outcome of one command is a prerequisite for the subsequent command to execute correctly. For instance, you could use this functionality to compile a program and, if successful, immediately proceed to execute the compiled program.\n\nIt's important to note that this function is intended exclusively for use on Windows operating systems, as the execution of system commands may vary across different environments, and the syntax for chaining commands with '&&' is specific to Windows command line behavior. Additionally, users should exercise caution when executing system-level commands to avoid unintentional modifications or damage to the system.\n\nHere is a basic usage example of how one might invoke this function in a script:\n\n```python\n# Example of executing a single command\nos.system(\"dir\")\n\n# Example of executing multiple commands chained with '&&'\nos.system(\"mkdir new_folder && cd new_folder\")\n```\n\nIn the first example, the function calls `os.system(\"dir\")`, which lists the contents of the current directory. In the second example, it attempts to create a new directory named 'new_folder' and, if successful, changes the current directory to 'new_folder'.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

The primary role of this function is to send a command-line instruction directly to the Windows shell for execution. When dealing with multiple commands that need to be executed in sequence, you should separate each command with the '&&' operator. This ensures that commands are executed one after another, and if one command fails, the subsequent commands will not be executed. This chaining mechanism can be particularly useful for simple tasks that require multiple steps to complete.\n\nHowever, when the task at hand is more complex and involves a series of intricate operations or requires error handling, it is advisable to create a batch file (.bat). A batch file can encapsulate a sequence of commands in a file that can be executed as a single entity.

For multiple commands, separate them with '&&'. For complex tasks, create and run a .bat file.This function serves the purpose of executing a specified command string within a Windows operating system environment by utilizing the `os.system()` function from Python's standard library. The `os.system()` function is a straightforward way to run shell commands; it passes the command in the form of a string to the system shell for execution. It should be noted that this approach is particularly tailored for Windows OS users.\n\nWhen constructing the command string, if your task involves a sequence of multiple commands, it is crucial to separate these commands using the '&&' operator. This ensures that each command is executed in order, where subsequent commands are only executed if the preceding command completes successfully. For example, if you need to change directories and then list its contents, you would structure your command string like so: `\"cd example_directory && dir\"`. This ensures that the directory listing only occurs if the directory change operation is successful.\n\nHowever, for more complex or conditional operations that surpass the basic capabilities of `os.system()`, or if your command sequence becomes excessively lengthy, it is advisable to encapsulate these operations within a batch script (a .bat file). A batch file allows for a more robust and maintainable approach to script writing. Once the batch file is created, you can execute it using `os.system()` by passing the file's path as the command argument, such as `os.system(\"example_script.bat\")`.\n\nBear in mind that `os.system()` returns a status code, with a return value of zero typically indicating successful execution, while non-zero values denote various types of errors.

The `os.system()` function is a simple way to run a command line operation from within a Python script. When you have a single command that needs to be executed, you can directly pass the command as a string to this function. \n\nIn scenarios where you need to execute multiple commands sequentially, you should concatenate these commands using the `&&` operator. This operator ensures that each command runs only if the previous command was successful, meaning it exited with a zero status. For example, if you need to run two commands where the second depends on the successful execution of the first, you can structure it like this: `command1 && command2`.\n\nHowever, for more intricate tasks that involve a series of complex or conditional commands, or when you need to execute commands that require file operations or loops, it is recommended to write these instructions in a batch file with the `.bat` extension. Once your batch file is prepared, you can execute it through the `os.system()` function by providing the path to the `.bat` file as an argument. This method is particularly beneficial for automation scripts or repetitive tasks that are too complex to handle through a single `os.system()` call with inline commands.\n\nThis approach is ideal for Windows-based systems, allowing seamless integration of command line tasks within a Python program, enhancing the script's functionality by leveraging system-level operations.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The Windows command line instruction(s) to be executed.

The function operates by filtering movies based on three primary attributes: the director of the movie, the genre, and members of the cast. Each of these attributes plays a crucial role in the search query to ensure that the results align closely with the user's interests.\n\n#### Parameters:\n1. **Director**: The name of the director is a key parameter for this function. It allows the user to filter movies directed by a particular filmmaker, enabling them to explore a director's body of work or discover new films by a director they admire.\n\n2. **Genre**: This parameter allows the user to specify the type or category of movie they are interested in. Whether the user is in the mood for a comedy, drama, action, thriller, or any other genre, this filter ensures that the movies retrieved align with the specified genre preference.\n\n3. **Cast**: Users can specify one or more actors or actresses to filter movies featuring these cast members. This is particularly useful for fans of specific performers who wish to explore their filmography or discover new works they have participated in.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nSuppose a user wishes to find movies directed by \"Christopher Nolan,\" within the \"Science Fiction\" genre, and starring \"Leonardo DiCaprio.\" By inputting these criteria into the function, the user would receive a list of movies that match all these attributes, such as \"Inception.\" This ensures a highly personalized and relevant movie discovery experience.\n\n#### Considerations:\n- If a user specifies only one or two of the parameters, the function will still retrieve movies based on the available criteria, thereby offering flexibility in how the search is conducted.\n- In cases where no movies match all the criteria provided, the function should ideally return an empty list, indicating that no such films are found within the database or collection being queried.\n\nThis functionality is particularly useful", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": [], "properties": {"directed_by": {"type": "string", "description": "Director of the movie.

By leveraging the powerful search capabilities of Spotify, the function allows users to input a query that can include parts of the song title, artist name, album, or other related metadata. Upon receiving the query, the function initiates a search within Spotify's extensive music library to find the best match or list of matches that correspond to the user's input.\n\nOnce the function identifies the correct song from the search results, it proceeds to play the song through the Spotify platform. The function ensures that the song is played using the user's Spotify account, provided that the account is authenticated and has the necessary permissions to play music through the service.\n\n#### Parameter Explanation\n\n- **query**: The query parameter is a string that represents the search term or terms the user wishes to use to find a song on Spotify. This can be a fragment or complete song title, the artist's name, album name, or a combination thereof. The query should be formulated to maximize the accuracy of the search results.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\nSuppose a user wants to listen to \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by Queen. The user can call the function with the query parameter set to \"Bohemian Rhapsody Queen\" or simply \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" to search for the song. The function will then search Spotify's library, identify the track, and proceed to play it.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n\n- If the query does not correspond to any identifiable song, the function should handle this scenario gracefully, possibly by returning an error message or prompt indicating that no match was found.\n- If multiple songs match the query closely, the function may either play the first result or prompt the user to choose from a list of possible matches.\n- The function requires an active internet connection and a valid Spotify account with streaming permissions to function correctly.

It is particularly useful for managers, team leads, or project coordinators who need an overview of the projects their team is currently involved in. The function includes optional parameters that allow users to customize the list according to specific needs, improving the relevance and clarity of the information retrieved.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **team_id**: The unique identifier for the team whose projects are being queried. This parameter is mandatory and serves as the primary filter for the function, ensuring that only projects linked to this specific team are returned.\n\n- **exclude_inactive** (optional): A boolean parameter that, when set to `true`, will exclude any projects that are marked as inactive. This is useful for users who are only interested in active projects that require attention and resources. By default, this parameter is set to `false`, meaning that inactive projects will be included in the results unless this option is explicitly enabled.\n\n- **exclude_child_projects** (optional): Another boolean parameter that allows users to exclude child projects from the list. Child projects are typically those that are part of a larger parent project. Users might choose to exclude these to focus on standalone projects or parent projects. The default value for this parameter is `false`, indicating that child projects will be included unless the user specifies otherwise.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- If the `team_id` provided does not correspond to any existing team, the function may return an empty list or an error message, depending on implementation details.\n\n- When both `exclude_inactive` and `exclude_child_projects` are set to `true`, the resulting list will contain only active, standalone projects associated with the specified team.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose a project manager wants to retrieve a list of all active projects for Team Alpha without any child projects. The function call would look something like this:\n\n```plaintext\nretrieve_team_projects(team_id=\"alpha123\",", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["uuid"], "properties": {"uuid": {"type": "string", "description": "The UUID of the team for which to retrieve the project mappings."}, "excludeInactive": {"type": "boolean", "description": "If set to true, inactive projects will be excluded from the results.", "default": false}, "onlyRoot": {"type": "boolean", "description": "If set to true, only root projects will be returned, excluding any child projects.", "default": false}}}}]}
