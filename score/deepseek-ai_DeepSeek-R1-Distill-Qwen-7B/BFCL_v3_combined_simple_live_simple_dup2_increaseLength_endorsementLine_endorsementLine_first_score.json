Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\]\n\nIn this calculation, the \"base\" refers to any one side of the triangle, which is considered the bottom edge when the triangle is viewed in a standard upright orientation.

It must be a real number greater than zero. This parameter is crucial as it forms part of the calculation to determine the triangle's area.\n- **height**: A positive numerical value representing the height of the triangle.

The GCD is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. It is a fundamental concept in number theory and is often used in various mathematical computations and algorithms.\n\n#### Parameters\n- **number1**: An integer value representing the first number for which the GCD is to be calculated. This number can be positive, negative, or zero.\n- **number2**: An integer value representing the second number involved in the GCD calculation. Like the first parameter, this can also be positive, negative, or zero.\n\n#### Functionality\nThe algorithm used to determine the GCD of two numbers typically involves the Euclidean algorithm, which is efficient and widely used. This method repeatedly replaces the larger number by the remainder of the division of the two numbers until one of the numbers becomes zero. At this point, the other non-zero number is the GCD of the original pair of numbers.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n- If both numbers are zero, the GCD is undefined. In practical implementations, this may return zero or raise an exception to indicate the indeterminate result.\n- If one number is zero and the other is non-zero, the GCD is the absolute value of the non-zero number.\n- If both numbers are negative, the GCD will be the same as if both numbers were positive, as the GCD is always a non-negative integer.\n\n#### Examples\n1. **Example 1**: \n   - Input: `number1 = 48`, `number2 = 18`\n   - Output: `6`\n   - Explanation: The divisors of 48 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48, and the divisors of 18 are", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"num1": {"type": "integer", "description": "The first number."}, "num2": {"type": "integer", "description": "The second number."}}, "required": ["num1", "num2"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\n[math.gcd1(params_name1=40, params_name2=50)]", "model_result_decoded": [{"math.gcd1": {"params_name1": 40, "params_name2": 50}}], "possible_answer": [{"math.gcd1": {"num1": [40], "num2": [50]}}, {"math.gcd2": {"num1": [40], "num2": [50]}}, {"math.gcd3": {"num1": [40], "num2": [50]}}]}

This calculation is fundamental in physics and various fields of engineering where understanding the speed of an object is crucial. \n\nTo achieve this, the function takes two primary inputs: the distance traveled and the duration over which this distance was covered. The distance parameter represents how far the object has moved, typically measured in units such as meters or kilometers, depending on the context or requirements of the specific application. The duration parameter indicates the time taken to travel the given distance, usually measured in seconds, minutes, or hours.\n\nThe velocity is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the duration of travel. This division yields a rate of motion, typically expressed in units such as meters per second (m/s) or kilometers per hour (km/h), providing a clear representation of how fast the object is moving.\n\nIt is important to ensure that both distance and duration are in compatible units to avoid incorrect calculations. For instance, if distance is measured in kilometers, duration should be in hours to obtain velocity in kilometers per hour, or if distance is in meters, duration should be in seconds to get velocity in meters per second.\n\nEdge cases that the function should consider include scenarios where the duration is zero, as this would result in division by zero, which is undefined and should be handled appropriately, possibly by returning an error or a null value. Additionally, if the distance is zero, the function should return a velocity of zero, indicating no movement.\n\nUsage example: If an object travels 100 meters in 20 seconds, the function would calculate the velocity as 100 meters divided by 20 seconds, resulting in a velocity of 5 meters per second. Similarly, if a car travels 150 kilometers in 3 hours, the calculated velocity would be 150 kilometers divided by 3 hours, giving a velocity of 50 kilometers per hour.

To achieve this, the function takes into account two key parameters: the acceleration of the object and the distance it has traveled. The calculation is based on the fundamental kinematic equation that relates velocity, acceleration, and distance. Specifically, it applies the formula:\n\n\\[ v_f = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot a \\cdot d} \\]\n\nHere, \\( v_f \\) represents the final velocity, \\( a \\) stands for the acceleration, and \\( d \\) denotes the distance traveled by the object.

It is typically measured in meters per second squared (m/s\u00b2). The function assumes that this acceleration does not change over the distance traveled.\n  \n- **distance (d)**: This parameter represents the total distance that the object has moved, measured in meters. It is the displacement from the initial position to the final position while the object is subject to the specified acceleration.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- If the acceleration is zero, the final velocity will remain zero regardless of the distance traveled, since there is no change in velocity.\n- If the distance is zero, even with a non-zero acceleration, the final velocity will also be zero, as there is no movement to impart any change in velocity.\n- Negative values for acceleration or distance are not physically meaningful in this context and may lead to unexpected results or errors in calculation.\n\n### Example Usage:\nSuppose you want to calculate the final velocity of a car that accelerates at 3 m/s\u00b2 over a distance of 100 meters, starting from rest.

This calculation is based on the principles of physics, specifically the laws of motion under the influence of gravity. The object is subject to gravitational acceleration, typically considered to be \\(9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\) on the surface of the Earth. \n\nTo determine the final speed, the function utilizes the formula derived from the conservation of energy or kinematic equations, which states that the final velocity \\(v\\) of an object falling freely under gravity from a height \\(h\\) is given by \\(v = \\sqrt{2gh}\\), where \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \\(h\\) is the height from which the object is dropped. This formula assumes that the object is initially at rest (initial speed = 0 m/s) and that there are no other forces acting on it other than gravity.\n\nEdge cases to consider include scenarios where the height is zero or negative. If the height is zero, the object is essentially starting at ground level, meaning no fall occurs, and thus the final speed remains zero. A negative height might indicate an error in input as it does not physically represent a possible scenario for the drop.\n\nFor practical usage, the function can be called with a parameter representing the height. It will return the final speed of the object just before it impacts the ground, providing a quantitative measure of how fast the object is moving at that point. This information can be critical in fields such as physics education, engineering, and safety calculations where understanding the dynamics of free-falling objects is pertinent.\n\nExample of usage:\n```python\nfinal_speed = calculate_final_speed(20)  # Calculate final speed when dropped from 20 meters\nprint(final_speed)  # Outputs: 19.8, which is the speed in meters per second\n```\nIn", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"initial_velocity": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial velocity of the object."}, "height": {"type": "integer", "description": "The height from which the object is dropped."}, "gravity": {"type": "float", "description": "The gravitational acceleration.

The logistic function, or sigmoid function, is key as it maps any real-valued number into this range. The model estimates the probability of the event based on one or more independent variables and is trained using methods like maximum likelihood estimation. The output can be converted into a class prediction using a threshold, typically 0.5. While it's a linear model, it can handle non-linear relationships through feature engineering.

Such processes are characterized by a constant temperature throughout and progress without any entropy production due to irreversibilities. The function relies on the fundamental thermodynamic relationship that defines entropy change in these specific conditions.\n\n#### Key Characteristics:\n\n1. **Isothermal Process:**\n   - The process occurs at a constant temperature. This implies that throughout the entire process, the temperature of the system does not change. This is in contrast to adiabatic processes where there is no heat exchange or processes where temperature varies.\n\n2. **Reversible Process:**\n   - The process is reversible, meaning it can be reversed by infinitesimally small changes in a property of the system, with no net change in entropy occurring in the surroundings. This idealized condition assumes that the process happens infinitely slowly so that the system remains in thermodynamic equilibrium at all times.\n\n3. **Entropy Change Calculation:**\n   - The entropy change (\\( \\Delta S \\)) for an isothermal, reversible process is calculated using the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\Delta S = \\frac{Q_{\\text{rev}}}{T}\n     \\]\n     where \\( Q_{\\text{rev}} \\) is the reversible heat exchanged and \\( T \\) is the absolute temperature at which the process occurs. It is important to note that \\( T \\) must be in Kelvin to maintain consistency with thermodynamic conventions.\n\n#### Parameter Explanation:\n\n- **\\( Q_{\\text{rev}} \\):**\n  - This parameter represents the amount of heat that is reversibly exchanged in the process. It is typically expressed in units of energy such as joules (J) or calories (cal).\n\n- **\\( T \\):**\n  - Represents the absolute temperature at which the process occurs.

Understanding the heat capacity at constant pressure is essential in thermodynamics and various engineering applications, as it reflects the amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of air by one degree while maintaining constant pressure.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **Temperature (T)**: \n   - **Type**: Typically represented in Kelvin (K) to maintain consistency with thermodynamic principles. However, it may be provided in Celsius (\u00b0C) or Fahrenheit (\u00b0F), requiring conversion to Kelvin.\n   - **Description**: The temperature of the air in question. This parameter significantly influences the heat capacity, as the physical properties of air, including its specific heat capacity, can vary with temperature changes.\n\n2. **Volume (V)**:\n   - **Type**: Usually given in cubic meters (m\u00b3), but any volume unit can be used as long as it's consistent throughout calculations.\n   - **Description**: The volume of the air sample under consideration. While volume plays a lesser role compared to temperature in this calculation, it's still an essential factor in the context of the overall thermodynamic state of the gas.\n\n#### Function Usage:\n\nThis function is particularly useful in situations where precise control of thermal conditions is required, such as in air conditioning systems, combustion engines, and atmospheric studies. By calculating the heat capacity at constant pressure, engineers and scientists can predict how air will react under various thermal loads, facilitating more efficient system designs and energy use.\n\n#### Edge Cases and Considerations:\n\n- **Non-Standard Conditions**: Ensure that input parameters are within the standard operating range for air. Extreme temperatures or pressures may necessitate adjustments or alternative approaches.\n- **Ideal Gas Assumption**: This calculation generally assumes that air behaves as an ideal gas. Deviations from this behavior may occur at high pressures or low temperatures,", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The temperature of the gas in Kelvin."}, "volume": {"type": "integer", "description": "The volume of the gas in m^3."}, "gas": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of gas, with 'air' as default."}}, "required": ["temp", "volume"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\n[calc_heat_capacity1({'temp': 298, 'volume': 10, 'gas': 'air'}), calc_heat_capacity1({'temp': 298, 'volume': 10, 'gas': 'air'})]", "model_result_decoded": [{"calc_heat_capacity1": {}}, {"calc_heat_capacity1": {}}], "possible_answer": [{"calc_heat_capacity1": {"temp": [298], "volume": [10], "gas": ["air", ""]}}, {"calc_heat_capacity2": {"temp": [298], "volume": [10], "gas": ["air", ""]}}, {"calc_heat_capacity3": {"temp": [298], "volume": [10], "gas": ["air", ""]}}]}

This calculation is based on two key inputs: the optical density (OD) of the sample and the dilution factor used during the experiment. \n\nOptical density, also known as absorbance, is a measure of how much light is absorbed by the sample at a specific wavelength, typically 600 nm for bacterial cultures. It's a proxy for the concentration of cells in the sample, as the more cells present, the more light is absorbed.\n\nThe dilution factor accounts for any dilution made during sample preparation to ensure accurate readings within the detection limits of the spectrophotometer. It refers to the ratio of the volume of the original sample to the total volume after dilution. \n\nTo obtain the cell density, the function multiplies the optical density by the dilution factor.

The Hardy-Weinberg Principle provides a framework for understanding genetic variation within a population that is not subject to evolutionary forces. It is an essential concept in population genetics, assuming that allele frequencies in a large population remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of other evolutionary influences.\n\nTo compute the frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype, the function uses the allele frequency of the dominant allele. Let \\( p \\) represent the frequency of the dominant allele.

This frequency \\( p \\) should be a value between 0 and 1, inclusive. If \\( p \\) is not within this range, the assumptions of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium are violated, and results may not be accurate.\n\n- **Calculation**: The calculation involves squaring the allele frequency \\( p \\) to find \\( p^2 \\), which represents the proportion of the population that is homozygous for the dominant allele.\n\n- **Edge Cases**: In scenarios where \\( p = 1 \\), indicating that the dominant allele is the only allele present in the population, the frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype will be 1, and no other genotypes will be present.

The calculation is performed based on the vehicle's type and its annual mileage. The function takes into account the average emissions rate for the specific type of vehicle, which is typically measured in grams of CO2 emitted per mile driven. By multiplying this emissions rate by the total number of miles the vehicle travels in a year, the function provides an estimate of the total carbon emissions produced annually.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **Vehicle Type**: The type of vehicle being considered for the emissions calculation. Different vehicles such as cars, trucks, motorcycles, and buses have varying emissions rates, influenced by factors like engine size, fuel type, and overall efficiency. The emissions rate for each vehicle type is an essential input for the calculation.\n\n- **Annual Mileage**: The total number of miles the vehicle is expected to travel over the course of a year. This parameter is crucial as it directly scales the emissions rate to reflect the actual usage of the vehicle. Mileage can vary widely based on personal or commercial use patterns, and accurate estimates are necessary for precise emissions calculations.\n\n#### Calculation Process:\n\nThe function uses the following steps to determine the annual carbon emissions:\n\n1. **Identify Emissions Rate**: Determine the average emissions rate for the specified vehicle type. This rate is typically sourced from standardized emissions data.\n\n2. **Compute Total Emissions**: Multiply the emissions rate by the annual mileage to compute the total emissions. The formula is:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Emissions (grams CO2)} = \\text{Emissions Rate (grams CO2/mile)} \\times \\text{Annual Mileage (miles)}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Output Result**: The function returns the calculated total carbon emissions in grams of CO2 for the entire year.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose you want to calculate the annual carbon emissions for a compact", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"vehicle_type": {"type": "string", "description": "The type of vehicle.

It calculates the projected number of elephants in a future period by applying the growth rate to the current population.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **current_population** (int or float): The current number of elephants. This must be a positive number, as a population cannot be negative. In cases where the population includes a fractional count, such as when estimating from partial surveys, a float can be used to represent partial elephants.\n  \n- **growth_rate** (float): The rate at which the elephant population is expected to grow over a specific time period. The growth rate should be expressed as a decimal. For example, a 5% growth rate should be entered as 0.05. A positive growth rate indicates an increase in population, whereas a negative growth rate would suggest a decrease over time.\n\n#### Returns:\n- **future_population** (float): The estimated number of elephants in the future. The result is typically rounded to the nearest whole number since elephant population counts are generally considered in whole numbers for practical purposes, though the function may return a float to accommodate calculations.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nSuppose the current population of elephants in a reserve is 1,000, and the annual growth rate is expected to be 3%, or 0.03.

The BMI is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{BMI} = \\frac{\\text{weight in kilograms}}{\\text{(height in meters)}^2} \\]\n\nTo utilize this function effectively, it requires two primary inputs:\n\n1. **Weight**: This should be the individual's weight, measured in kilograms.

By utilizing these inputs, the function locates the correct song in the music database or streaming service library and initiates playback.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **song_title (string):** This parameter represents the name of the song you wish to play. It should match the title as it appears in the music catalog to ensure accurate retrieval and playback.\n  \n- **artist_name (string):** This parameter specifies the artist responsible for performing the song. It is crucial that the artist's name is spelled correctly and corresponds to the entry in the music database, as this ensures the correct version or rendition of the song is selected.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nTo use this function effectively, pass the song's title and the artist's name as arguments. For example, to play \"Shape of You\" by Ed Sheeran, you would call the function as follows:\n\n```python\nplay_song(\"Shape of You\", \"Ed Sheeran\")\n```\n\nThis would trigger the music player to search for \"Shape of You\" by Ed Sheeran and start playing it if it is found in the available music library.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Incorrect Song Title or Artist Name:** If either the song title or artist name is incorrect or misspelled, the function may not find the desired song, resulting in an error or a failure to play the song.\n  \n- **Multiple Versions or Covers:** In cases where there are multiple versions or covers of a song by different artists, specifying the correct artist becomes critical for playing the intended version.\n\n- **Network or Service Availability:** The function's ability to play the song is contingent upon network connectivity and the availability of the song in the streaming service's library.

The position of the hour hand is determined not only by the hour but also by the minutes that have passed since the beginning of that hour, as the hour hand moves continuously. Specifically, the hour hand moves at a rate of 30 degrees per hour, and therefore, 0.5 degrees per minute. For example, at 3:15, the hour hand is not exactly at the 3 o'clock position but rather slightly ahead, specifically at 97.5 degrees (90 degrees for 3 hours plus an additional 7.5 degrees for 15 minutes).\n\nThe minute hand, on the other hand, moves at a consistent rate of 6 degrees per minute as it completes a full circle, or 360 degrees, every hour.

Like the weight, the height must also be input in the specified unit to maintain the accuracy of the BMI result.\n\n### Calculation:\nThe BMI is calculated using the formula:\n\\[ \\text{BMI} = \\frac{\\text{weight in kilograms}}{(\\text{height in meters})^2} \\]\n\nThis formula requires the weight to be divided by the square of the height, which results in a unit of measurement known as kg/m\u00b2. The resulting BMI value provides a numerical representation of the person's body fat, allowing for a standardized assessment of their weight category.\n\n### Usage Example:\nFor instance, if a person weighs 70 kilograms and has a height of 1.75 meters, the function would compute their BMI as follows:\n\\[ \\text{BMI} = \\frac{70}{(1.75)^2} = \\frac{70}{3.0625} \\approx 22.86 \\]\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- **Zero or Negative Height**: If the height is zero or negative, it would result in division by zero or an invalid calculation, leading to an error or undefined BMI. It is essential to validate input to ensure height is a positive number.\n- **Zero or Negative Weight**: While theoretically possible", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"weight": {"type": "integer", "description": "The weight of the person in kilograms."}, "height": {"type": "integer", "description": "The height of the person in centimeters."}, "system": {"type": "string", "description": "The system of units to be used, 'metric' or 'imperial'.

This calculation takes into account three key parameters: the total number of trials, the number of successes desired, and the probability of success on an individual trial.\n\nThe first parameter is the total number of trials, often denoted as 'n', representing how many times the experiment is conducted.

For strings, it returns the characters in reverse order. For booleans, it returns the negation. For numbers, it returns the negative value.The function is designed to reverse or invert the provided input, thereby transforming it into its opposite form based on the data type. Let's break down the behavior according to different input types:\n\n1. **Strings**: When the input is a string, the function processes the sequence of characters by reversing their order. For instance, if the input is the string \"hello\", the function will output \"olleh\". This operation is applicable to strings of any length, including empty strings. An empty string will simply return as an empty string since there are no characters to reorder.\n\n2. **Booleans**: In the case of a boolean input, the function will return the logical negation of the given value. Therefore, if the input is `true`, the function will return `false`, and if the input is `false`, it will return `true`. This inversion adheres to the standard logical NOT operation.\n\n3. **Numbers**: For numerical inputs, the function's operation is to return the negative value of the number, effectively changing its sign. For example, an input of `5` will result in `-5`, and conversely, an input of `-3.5` will output `3.5`. It is important to note that for an input of `0`, the function will still return `0`, as the negation of zero is zero itself.\n\nThrough this function, users can efficiently transform the input across different data types, ensuring the result is the conceptual opposite of the original value.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["input_value"], "properties": {"input_value": {"type": "any", "description": "The value to be reversed.

The prediction model takes into account the size of the area, which is typically measured in square feet or square meters, as a fundamental aspect influencing house price. Larger areas generally correlate with higher market values, but this is subject to other influencing factors.\n\nIn addition to area, the function considers the number of rooms within the house. This parameter can include bedrooms, bathrooms, living areas, and kitchens, with homes featuring more rooms often being valued higher due to their increased capacity and functionality. The prediction model evaluates how the count of these rooms interacts with the overall market trends in pricing.\n\nThe year of construction is also a critical factor in the prediction model. Older buildings may be valued differently based on their architectural style, historical value, or need for renovations, while newer constructions might be priced higher due to modern design and materials.

By iterating over each element in the list, the function appends them together in the order they appear, creating a unified string that represents the sequence of the original list elements.\n\n#### Parameters\n- **string_list**: A list consisting of string elements. Each element in this list should be a valid string, and the list should be ordered in the way that you wish the final string to appear once concatenated.\n\n#### Returns\n- **result_string**: A single string that contains all the elements from the input list concatenated together in the same order they appear within the list. There are no separators or delimiters added between the list elements during the concatenation process unless they are part of the list items themselves.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n- **Empty list**: If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty string as the concatenated result since there are no elements to combine.\n- **Single element list**: If the list contains only one string element, the function returns that single string as the output without any modifications.\n- **Non-string elements**: The function assumes all elements in the list are strings. If non-string elements are present, the function may raise an error or behave unpredictably unless explicitly handled.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\n```python\n# Example with multiple strings\nstrings = [\"Hello\", \" \", \"World\", \"!\"]\nresult = concatenate_strings(strings)\nprint(result)  # Output: \"Hello World!\"\n\n# Example with a single string\nstrings = [\"SingleString\"]\nresult = concatenate_strings(strings)\nprint(result)  # Output: \"SingleString\"\n\n# Example with an empty list\nstrings = []\nresult = concatenate_strings(strings)\nprint(result)  # Output: \"\"\n\n# Note: Ensure all elements in the list are strings to avoid errors.\n``` \n\nThis function is particularly useful in", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["strings"], "properties": {"strings": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "An array of strings to be concatenated."}, "separator": {"type": "string", "description": "The string to be used as a separator between each string in the array.", "default": ""}}}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\n[concat_strings1(['John', 'Doe'], separator='')]", "model_result_decoded": [{"concat_strings1": {"separator": ""}}], "possible_answer": [{"concat_strings1": {"strings": [["John", "Doe"]], "separator": [" "]}}, {"concat_strings2": {"strings": [["John", "Doe"]], "separator": [" "]}}, {"concat_strings3": {"strings": [["John", "Doe"]], "separator": [" "]}}]}

The NPV calculation is a crucial financial metric used to assess the profitability and feasibility of an investment by evaluating the present value of expected future cash flows in comparison to the initial investment cost.\n\nParameters involved in the calculation include:\n\n- **Future Cash Flows**: This is a series of anticipated monetary gains or expenses expected to be received or paid out at various future periods. These cash flows are usually expressed in a sequence, such as an array or list, where each entry represents the cash flow for a specific period.\n  \n- **Discount Rate**: This is a rate of return used to discount future cash flows back to their present value.

A higher discount rate indicates a riskier investment or a higher cost of capital.\n\n- **Initial Investment**: The initial outlay of capital required to fund the investment.

It takes into account the yearly yield of the fund, the amount of money invested, and the duration over which the investment is held. By synthesizing these elements, the function provides an estimate of the potential financial return.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **Yearly Yield**: This parameter represents the annual percentage rate at which the mutual fund is expected to grow. It is typically expressed as a percentage. The yearly yield should reflect realistic market conditions and mutual fund performance metrics. For example, a yearly yield of 5% would be input as 0.05.\n\n2. **Investment Amount**: This parameter details the total sum of money that is initially invested into the mutual fund. It is crucial for determining the base from which returns are calculated. The investment amount should be a positive numerical value representing the amount in currency units (e.g., dollars, euros).\n\n3. **Time Period**: This parameter indicates the duration for which the investment is held. The time period is usually expressed in years and should be a positive integer or a decimal value. For instance, an investment period of 5 years could be entered as 5 or 5.0.\n\n#### Calculation Process:\n\nThe function employs the formula for calculating compound interest, adjusted for mutual funds. The estimated return is derived by applying the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Estimated Return} = \\text{Investment Amount} \\times (1 + \\text{Yearly Yield})^{\\text{Time Period}} \\]\n\nThis calculation assumes that the yield is compounded annually, meaning the investment grows at the yearly yield rate each year over the specified time period.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- If the yearly yield is 0, the function should return the original investment amount, as no growth would occur without yield.\n- Negative values for the yearly yield are generally not expected and", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"yearly_yield": {"type": "float", "description": "The yearly yield of the mutual fund as a percentage."}, "investment_amount": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial investment amount in the mutual fund."}, "years": {"type": "integer", "description": "The time period for which the investment is made in years."}}, "required": ["yearly_yield", "investment_amount", "years"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\n[estimate_mutual_fund_return1(yearly_yield=0.05, investment_amount=2000, years=3)]", "model_result_decoded": [{"estimate_mutual_fund_return1": {"yearly_yield": 0.05, "investment_amount": 2000, "years": 3}}], "possible_answer": [{"estimate_mutual_fund_return1": {"yearly_yield": [5.0], "investment_amount": [2000], "years": [3]}}, {"estimate_mutual_fund_return2": {"yearly_yield": [5.0], "investment_amount": [2000], "years": [3]}}, {"estimate_mutual_fund_return3": {"yearly_yield": [5.0], "investment_amount": [2000], "years": [3]}}]}

The primary purpose of this function is to provide an interface for running shell commands directly from a Python script. \n\nOne of the key features of this function is its ability to execute both single commands and multiple commands that are chained together. When chaining multiple commands, the commands are connected using the logical operator '&&', which ensures that each command is executed sequentially only if the preceding command completes successfully without errors. This chaining mechanism is particularly useful in scenarios where the outcome of each command is dependent on the successful execution of the previous command.\n\nFor instance, a single command like `dir` could be executed simply to list the contents of a directory. However, if you need to perform a sequence of operations, such as creating a directory and then moving into it, you might use `mkdir new_folder && cd new_folder`, where `mkdir new_folder` will only be followed by `cd new_folder` if the directory creation is successful.\n\nIt is important to note that the `os.system()` function operates synchronously. This means that it will wait for the command to complete before returning control to the Python program. The return value of `os.system()` is the exit status of the executed command, which can be used to determine if the command executed successfully or if there were any errors.\n\nThis function is particularly useful for automating system administration tasks, testing deployment scripts, or running legacy commands that do not have direct Python equivalents. However, users should be cautious when using this function, as executing shell commands can potentially modify the system environment or data if not properly managed.\n\nIn summary, this function is a robust tool for executing both simple and complex command sequences on Windows systems through Python, offering flexibility and control over system-level operations directly from the scripting environment.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

The function returns an exit status code which indicates the result of the executed command. A return value of zero usually signifies successful execution, while any non-zero value indicates an error.\n\nFor example, to execute a single command such as listing all files in a directory, you might call the function with the argument `dir`.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.This function facilitates the execution of system-level commands specifically on Windows operating systems by utilizing the `os.system()` function from Python's standard library. The primary purpose of this function is to enable interaction with the operating system's command shell, allowing users to perform tasks that are typically executed via the command line interface.\n\nWhen using this function, you can execute a single command, such as starting a program or running a script. For instance, you might use it to open Notepad by passing the command `'notepad'`. Moreover, this function is versatile enough to handle multiple commands in a sequential manner. This is achieved by chaining commands together using the '&&' operator, which ensures that each command is executed only if the preceding one succeeds. For example, you could chain two commands like this: `'command1 && command2'`. In this scenario, `command2` will only be executed if `command1` completes successfully without errors.\n\nIt is important to note that the `os.system()` function executes the commands in a subshell, which means that any changes made by the commands, such as environment variable modifications, will not affect the parent Python process. Additionally, the function returns the exit status of the shell, which is a way to check if the command execution was successful. Typically, a return value of `0` indicates success, while any non-zero value signifies some form of error or issue.\n\nMoreover, while this function is designed to work on Windows, using commands specific to other operating systems like Linux or macOS may not work or could produce unexpected results due to differences in command syntax and available utilities. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that the commands you execute are compatible with the Windows operating system.\n\nIn summary, this function provides a straightforward approach to executing system commands on Windows, supporting both single and multiple command execution through chaining, using the '&&' operator.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.This function is designed to execute system-level commands specifically on Windows operating systems by utilizing the `os.system()` method provided by Python. The `os.system()` function is a part of the `os` module, which is used to interact with the operating system. This function allows users to run commands that would typically be executed in the command prompt, enabling automation of various tasks directly from a Python script.\n\nThe function can execute not just a single command but also multiple commands, which can be chained together using the '&&' operator. In the context of command-line operations, the '&&' operator is used to concatenate commands, ensuring that the subsequent command is executed only if the preceding command completes successfully. This chaining mechanism provides a powerful way to perform a sequence of operations, checking the success of each step before proceeding to the next.\n\nFor example, if you want to navigate to a directory and then list the files within it, you could use the following command string: `\"cd path/to/directory && dir\"`. Here, `cd` changes the current directory, and `dir` lists the contents of that directory. The usage of '&&' ensures that the 'dir' command will only run if the 'cd' command is executed without errors.\n\nIt is important to note that since the function relies on `os.system()`, it is synchronous; it will wait for the command to complete before moving on to the next line of code in the script. This can be useful when the completion of a command is necessary before subsequent actions can be performed.\n\nUsers should be cautious with the commands they execute, as running system commands can potentially alter system configurations or delete important data if used improperly. Additionally, the function assumes that the commands provided are compatible with the Windows command prompt syntax and environment.\n\nIn summary, this function provides a mechanism to execute one or more Windows command prompt commands from within a Python application, offering flexibility and control over system operations directly through Python scripts.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.This function is designed to execute system-level commands by utilizing the `os.system()` method specifically on Windows operating systems. The `os.system()` function is a part of the `os` module in Python, which provides a portable way of using operating system-dependent functionality. When using this function, users can execute not only singular commands but also multiple commands that are chained together using the '&&' operator. This chaining allows for the sequential execution of commands, where each subsequent command will only run if the previous one succeeds without errors. \n\nFor instance, executing `os.system('command1 && command2')` will attempt to run `command1` first. If `command1` executes successfully, then `command2` will be executed next. In the context of Windows operating systems, this can be particularly useful for executing a series of administrative or maintenance tasks that need to be completed in a specific order, such as updating software packages or configuring system settings. \n\nWhen using this function, it's important to note that `os.system()` runs the command in a subshell. This means it can handle environment variables and command path resolutions typical to the Windows shell environment. However, users should be cautious with commands that require user interaction, as `os.system()` does not provide a means to capture or respond to user prompts. Additionally, error handling should be considered, as the function will return the exit status of the command executed, which can be used to determine success or failure. \n\nHere is an example of how one might use this function:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Execute a single command\nos.system('dir')\n\n# Execute multiple commands chained with '&&'\nos.system('echo Starting process && dir && echo Process complete')\n```\n\nIn this example, the first command lists the contents of the current directory, while the second example demonstrates chaining commands where it first prints a message, lists directory contents, and then prints another message upon successful completion of the previous commands.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

The unique identifier is an essential component used to distinguish and access the specific service in a system where multiple services may exist under similar categories.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **Service Type**: This parameter specifies the category or kind of service for which the identifier is being retrieved. Service types could include various options such as \"healthcare,\" \"transportation,\" \"hospitality,\" or any other predefined service category within the system. This parameter is crucial because it narrows down the search to the relevant category, ensuring that the function retrieves the identifier for the correct type of service.\n- **Location**: This parameter denotes the geographical area or specific site where the service is offered. It could be in the form of a city name, postal code, or any other location identifier recognized by the system. The location parameter is used in conjunction with the service type to further refine the search, as the same type of service may be available in multiple locations.\n\n#### Functionality:\nThe function operates by processing the inputs to search through a database or a predefined set of records to find a match that corresponds to both the specified service type and location. Once a match is found, the function returns the unique identifier associated with that specific combination of service type and location.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- In scenarios where there is no service available for the provided combination of service type and location, the function may return a null value or an error message indicating that the requested service could not be found.\n- It is important to handle cases where the inputs may be invalid or improperly formatted.

This calculation involves determining the rate of elevation change over the horizontal distance between these two points. The slope gradient is an important measure in various fields, such as geography, civil engineering, and environmental science, as it can influence factors like water runoff, erosion, and construction planning.\n\nTo perform this calculation accurately, the function requires several parameters: the latitude and longitude of both the first and second points, as well as their respective elevations. The latitude and longitude should be provided in decimal degrees, a common format used in GPS systems, where positive values indicate north and east, respectively, and negative values indicate south and west. The elevations of the two points should be given in meters above sea level.\n\nThe calculation involves determining the horizontal distance between the two coordinates, which can be computed using the Haversine formula. This formula accounts for the Earth's curvature, providing more accurate distance measurements than simple planar calculations, especially over large distances. Once the horizontal distance is determined, the difference in elevation between the two points is calculated. The slope gradient is then found by dividing the elevation difference by the horizontal distance, often expressed as a percentage or angle, indicating how steep the slope is between the two points.\n\nFor example, if Point A is at latitude 34.05, longitude -118.25 with an elevation of 100 meters, and Point B is at latitude 34.10, longitude -118.20 with an elevation of 150 meters, the function will first calculate the horizontal distance between these points using their geographical coordinates.

For instance:\n\n```python\nrecommended_intake = calculate_recommended_daily_water_intake(70)\nprint(f\"The recommended daily water intake is {recommended_intake} liters.\")\n```\n\n#### Edge Cases and Considerations:\n- **Unit Consistency**: Ensure that the weight is provided in the correct unit (kilograms or pounds) consistent with the function's implementation, as this will impact the conversion factor used in the calculation.\n- **Special Circumstances**: This function does not account for factors such as physical activity level, climate, health conditions, or pregnancy, which could also affect water intake needs. It is recommended that the calculated intake be used as a baseline, with adjustments made for individual circumstances.\n\nBy using this function, individuals can gain a better understanding of how much water they should ideally be consuming each day, considering their body weight as a primary factor.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"weight": {"type": "integer", "description": "The weight of the person in kilograms."}, "activity_level": {"type": "string", "description": "The level of physical activity of the person.

This calculation is based on three critical input parameters: the distance traveled by the vehicle in a year, the type of fuel used by the vehicle, and the vehicle's fuel efficiency. \n\nThe first parameter, distance traveled, refers to the total number of miles or kilometers the vehicle covers over the course of a year. This data is essential as it directly impacts the total fuel consumption of the vehicle, which in turn influences the amount of CO2 emissions.\n\nThe second parameter is the fuel type, which specifies the kind of fuel the vehicle uses, such as gasoline, diesel, or alternative fuels like natural gas or electricity. Each fuel type has a distinct carbon emission factor, which determines how much CO2 is released per unit of fuel consumed. For instance, gasoline and diesel have different carbon contents and thus different emission impacts when burned.\n\nThe third parameter, fuel efficiency, indicates how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel, typically expressed as miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). Higher fuel efficiency implies that the vehicle can travel farther on a smaller amount of fuel, thereby reducing the overall CO2 emissions.\n\nBy combining these three parameters, the function calculates the vehicle's total annual CO2 emissions, providing valuable insights for individuals or organizations aiming to monitor and reduce their carbon footprint.

The primary purpose of this function is to provide users with a quick overview of the movie's key details. Here is an expanded explanation of its usage, parameters, and possible edge cases:\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **movie_title** (string): This parameter takes the title of the movie for which the brief is to be retrieved. It is case-sensitive and should be provided as a string. Ensure that the spelling and formatting of the movie title match exactly with the official title as it appears in the movie database.\n\n#### Functionality:\nUpon invocation, the function accesses a predefined movie database or API to locate and extract a brief description of the movie specified by the `movie_title` parameter. This brief typically includes essential information such as a short plot summary, genre, principal actors, and release year. The function focuses on delivering a succinct overview rather than an exhaustive analysis of the movie.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n```python\nmovie_brief = get_movie_brief(\"Inception\")\nprint(movie_brief)\n```\nIn this example, the function `get_movie_brief` is called with \"Inception\" as an argument.

Higher input or weight increases firing rate and higher decay rate decreases it.The function is designed to calculate the neuronal activity, specifically the rate of firing, by taking into account several critical factors: the input synaptic rate, the weight of the inputs, and the decay rate. The neuronal firing rate is influenced by these parameters in the following ways: \n\n1. **Input Synaptic Rate**: This parameter represents the frequency or rate at which synaptic inputs are received by the neuron. It is a crucial determinant of the firing rate as it directly correlates with the level of neuronal activity. A higher input synaptic rate indicates a greater number of synaptic signals are being received, thus increasing the likelihood of a neuron firing.\n\n2. **Weight of Inputs**: This factor signifies the strength or significance of each input signal. In neural networks, synaptic weights are used to scale input values, reflecting the importance or influence of each incoming synapse on the neuron's overall activity. An increase in the weight of the inputs results in a proportional increase in the firing rate, as the inputs contribute more significantly to neuronal activation.\n\n3. **Decay Rate**: This parameter reflects the rate at which the neuron's activity diminishes over time. It acts as a counterbalance to the excitatory effects of input synaptic rate and input weights. A higher decay rate implies that the neuron's activity decreases more rapidly, thereby reducing the firing rate. This could be due to various factors such as cellular mechanisms that limit excessive firing or the natural attrition of signals over time.\n\nUnderstanding the interplay of these parameters is essential for accurately modeling neuronal activity. For example, if both the input synaptic rate and the weight of inputs are high while the decay rate is low, the neuron is likely to have a high rate of firing. Conversely, if the decay rate is high, it can significantly dampen the firing rate even when the input synaptic rate and weights are substantial. This balance ensures that neurons respond appropriately to stimuli and maintain homeostasis within neural circuits.\n\n**Usage Example**: Consider", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"input_synaptic_rate": {"type": "integer", "description": "The synaptic input rate, usually represented as number of inputs per second."}, "weight": {"type": "float", "description": "The weight of the input, denoting its influence on the neuron's state.

It takes into account not only the total area that needs to be painted but also the efficiency of the paint being used, commonly referred to as its \"coverage efficiency.\" Additionally, it allows for the consideration of areas that should be excluded from painting, such as windows, doors, or any other features that do not require paint.\n\n#### Function Inputs:\n- **Total Area to Paint**: The overall surface area measured in square units (such as square feet or square meters) that is intended to be painted.\n- **Paint Coverage Efficiency**: A measure of how much area a unit of paint can cover, typically specified by the manufacturer (for example, 350 square feet per gallon).\n- **Exclusions**: The combined area of all surfaces that are not to be painted, such as windows or doors. This is also measured in the same square units as the total area.\n\n#### Calculation Details:\n1. **Net Paintable Area**: First, calculate the net paintable area by subtracting the exclusions from the total area to be painted. This involves simple arithmetic: \n   - `Net Paintable Area = Total Area - Exclusions`\n2. **Amount of Paint Required**: Next, determine the amount of paint needed by dividing the net paintable area by the paint coverage efficiency:\n   - `Paint Required = Net Paintable Area / Paint Coverage Efficiency`\n\nThis calculation will yield the quantity of paint necessary to cover the specified area, adjusted for both the paint's efficiency and any parts of the area that are not to be painted.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- If the exclusions are greater than or equal to the total area, the net paintable area should be considered zero, implying that no paint is required.\n- If the coverage efficiency is zero or not provided, the function should handle this as an error or return a message indicating that the coverage efficiency", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"area": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"width": {"type": "integer", "description": "The width of the area to be painted in feet."}, "height": {"type": "integer", "description": "The height of the area to be painted in feet."}}, "description": "The area to be painted."}, "paint_coverage": {"type": "integer", "description": "Coverage area per gallon of the paint in square feet.", "default": 350}, "exclusion": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"type": {"type": "string", "description": "The type of the exclusion e.g window, door etc."}, "area": {"type": "integer", "description": "The area of the exclusion in square feet."}}, "description": "Area not to be painted.

The goal is to streamline the search process for musicians or music enthusiasts by narrowing down options to those that meet both financial and categorical criteria. \n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **Budget (float or integer)**: This parameter defines the maximum amount the user is willing to spend on the musical instrument. It ensures that the search results only include instruments that are priced within this specified budget, helping users avoid overspending.\n\n- **Type (string)**: This parameter specifies the category or kind of musical instrument the user is interested in, such as 'guitar', 'piano', 'violin', etc. It ensures the search is limited to the particular type of instrument, making the results more relevant to the user's needs.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose a user has a budget of $500 and is looking for a 'guitar'. The function would be called with these two parameters to return a list of available guitars that do not exceed the $500 budget. This targeted search approach saves time and effort by focusing only on relevant instruments.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- If the budget is set to a very low amount, results may return instruments that are rare or non-existent within that price range, or it may return no results if no instruments are available below the specified budget.\n\n- The type parameter should be accurately specified to ensure correct categorization of the desired instrument.

These parameters could include, but are not limited to, the brand of the flute, material (such as silver, gold, or wood), type (e.g., concert, alto, bass), and price range. This specificity ensures that users find a flute that best matches their individual needs and preferences.\n\n2. **Database Search**: The function accesses a comprehensive database of flutes currently available for sale. This database is regularly updated to reflect current inventory from multiple sellers, ensuring that the information is up-to-date and relevant.\n\n3. **Filtering Mechanism**: Users can filter search results based on the criteria mentioned, allowing them to quickly and efficiently locate flutes that meet their requirements. This reduces the time spent browsing through irrelevant listings and enhances the user experience by focusing on relevant options.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**: In scenarios where the specified criteria yield no results, the function may suggest broadening the search parameters.

Additionally, the function evaluates the condition of the guitar, which is a critical determinant of its price. For instance, a guitar in mint or excellent condition will generally fetch a higher price than one that shows significant signs of wear and tear, such as scratches, dings, or malfunctions.\n\nFurthermore, the location where the guitar is being sold can also impact its price.

A music scale is a series of notes that provides the foundation for the melody and harmony of a composition. Common examples include major, minor, pentatonic, or modal scales like Dorian or Mixolydian. The chosen scale influences the mood, harmonic structure, and overall feel of the mix.\n\n2. **Duration Parameter**:\n   - Another critical aspect of this function is specifying the duration of the song mix. Duration is typically measured in minutes and seconds. This parameter ensures that the output song mix fits within a predefined time frame, making it suitable for specific applications like background music for videos, dance routines, or relaxation tracks.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n\n- If an unsupported or unrecognized scale is provided, the function may default to a basic scale such as C Major or return an error, depending on the implementation.\n- Similarly, if the duration is set to an impractically short or long time (e.g., a few seconds or several hours), the function may either provide a warning, adjust to a minimum or maximum threshold, or fail to execute appropriately.\n\n### Usage Example:\n\nConsider a scenario where a user wants to generate a 3-minute mix in the Dorian scale. The function call might look something like this:\n\n```\ncreateSongMix(scale='Dorian', duration='3:00')\n```\n\nGiven these inputs, the function will produce a song mix lasting exactly three minutes, with all musical elements\u2014such as melody, harmony, and rhythm\u2014crafted around the Dorian scale's specific set of notes.\n\n### Parameter Explanation:\n\n- **scale**: A string", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"scale": {"type": "string", "description": "The musical scale to be used.

Additionally, the function requires the input of a duration, defining how long the scale progression will last. This duration can be customized to fit within a particular song section or to meet specific project requirements. By combining these parameters\u2014key, tempo, and duration\u2014the function generates a coherent and rhythmically consistent scale progression tailored to the user's musical context. \n\nFor example, to generate a scale progression in the key of G major at a tempo of 120 BPM for a duration of 30 seconds, the function would systematically arrange the notes of the G major scale in a sequence that fits within the given timeframe, adhering to the specified tempo. The output would be a musical passage that can be used in a variety of applications, such as composing, arranging, or practicing musical pieces. This makes the function a versatile tool for musicians looking to experiment with different musical ideas or to construct foundational elements for their compositions.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"key": {"type": "string", "description": "The key in which to generate the scale progression."}, "tempo": {"type": "integer", "description": "The tempo of the scale progression in BPM."}, "duration": {"type": "integer", "description": "The duration of each note in beats."}, "scale_type": {"type": "string", "default": "major", "description": "The type of scale to generate.

The function will typically compare the player's hand against the dealer's hand to establish who has the superior hand. \n\nKey considerations when determining the winner include the following scenarios:\n\n1. **Blackjack Check**: If the player or dealer has a hand value of exactly 21 with their initial two cards, this is considered a 'blackjack'. A blackjack is the highest possible hand and will generally result in an automatic win unless both the player and dealer have blackjack, in which case it is a tie or 'push'.\n\n2. **Bust**: If a player's or dealer's hand exceeds the total value of 21, this is known as a 'bust', and the individual who busts automatically loses, regardless of the opponent's hand.\n\n3. **Comparison of Hand Values**: If neither party has a blackjack or busts, the function will compare the final hand values of both the player and dealer. The hand closest to 21 wins. If both hands are of equal value, the game results in a push.\n\n4. **Dealer's Rules**: The dealer usually plays according to predetermined rules, such as standing on a hard 17 or higher and hitting on 16 or lower. These rules should be considered when evaluating the dealer's hand.\n\n5. **Ace Value**: Aces can be counted as either 1 or 11 points.

It is usually a numerical value, such as an average rating, that helps to filter out sushi places that do not meet a certain level of customer satisfaction. The function will consider only those places with a review rate equal to or greater than this specified value.\n\n3. **Top Number**: This parameter indicates the number of top sushi places to be returned by the function. It is an integer that allows users to specify how many of the highest-rated sushi places should be included in the output. For example, if the top number is set to 5, the function will provide a list of the five best sushi places according to the review rate within the specified city.\n\nThe function processes these inputs to generate a ranked list of sushi places, ensuring that the results are tailored to the user's preferences regarding location, quality, and quantity. Edge cases to consider include the possibility of there being fewer sushi places meeting the criteria than the number requested by the top number parameter, in which case the function will return all available options that meet the review rate requirement. Additionally, if the review rate is set too high, it might result in a very limited or empty list of sushi places, especially in smaller cities.

It allows the user to target specific destinations for their stay, ensuring they are in proximity to desired attractions or business venues.\n\n2. **Room Type**: The room type parameter defines the category or style of room the user wishes to book. Options might include standard rooms, deluxe suites, or family rooms, each offering different amenities and price points.\n\n3. **Stay Duration**: This parameter indicates the length of time the user intends to stay at the hotel. It typically includes both the check-in date and the check-out date, allowing the function to calculate the total number of nights the room will be occupied.\n\n4. **Additional Preferences**: Users can specify any special requests or additional preferences they might have, such as a room with a view, non-smoking facilities, pet-friendly accommodations, or accessibility features.

In addition, it estimates the duration of the trip, providing an expected travel time in hours and minutes. This estimate is based on average driving speeds and usual traffic conditions along the chosen path.\n\nThis function is particularly useful for planning trips, enabling users to gauge how long a journey might take and how far they will need to travel. Additionally, it can help in comparing different routes or modes of transport by providing clear travel metrics. \n\nFor example, if a user inputs \"New York City\" as the starting location and \"Los Angeles\" as the destination, the function will output both the total driving distance in miles and the estimated travel time in hours, allowing the user to plan their trip accordingly. \n\nEdge cases that may affect the function include incomplete or ambiguous location inputs and dynamically changing traffic conditions. It's important for users to ensure that the locations are correctly specified and to be aware that real-time factors such as road closures or severe weather can alter the travel time estimate.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"start_location": {"type": "string", "description": "Starting point of the journey"}, "end_location": {"type": "string", "description": "Ending point of the journey"}, "traffic": {"type": "boolean", "description": "If true, considers current traffic.

It is expected to be provided in a format that specifies its geographical coordinates, such as latitude and longitude.\n- **location2**: This parameter is the destination point for the distance calculation. Like `location1`, it should also be provided in the form of geographical coordinates.\n\n### Considerations:\n- **Terrain Factors**: The function analyzes different factors such as elevation changes, surface types, and the presence of natural obstacles. These factors are crucial as they may increase the effective distance compared to the direct linear distance between the two points.\n- **Accuracy**: The function aims to provide a more accurate representation of travel distance by factoring in terrain variations, which is particularly useful for applications like hiking, off-road navigation, and logistics planning in areas where the terrain significantly impacts travel paths.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- If either location is at a significantly higher elevation than the other, the function should incorporate these differences to provide a realistic travel distance.\n- In areas where terrain data is sparse or unavailable, the function might revert to using an approximation or a default assumption about the terrain, which could affect accuracy.\n\n### Usage Example:\nTo use this function effectively, ensure that both locations are specified with accurate geographical data.
