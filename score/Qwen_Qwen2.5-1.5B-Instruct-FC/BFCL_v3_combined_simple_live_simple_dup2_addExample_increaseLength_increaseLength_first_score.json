Additionally, this function assumes that the input food name is a valid and recognized term within the system's food selection database. If the name does not match any known items, the function may need additional logic to handle such scenarios, although this is not covered in the current description.\n\nFor example, if a customer requests the food item \"pasta,\" the function would take \"pasta\" as input, convert it to \"PASTA,\" and then proceed to change the selection as requested, ensuring the system updates reflect the customer's choice in the required format.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["TheFod"], "properties": {"TheFod": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the food to be changed, provided in uppercase letters only (e.g., 'PIZZA', 'BURGER').", "enum": ["PIZZA", "BURGER", "SALAD", "SOUP", "STEAK"]}}}}, {"name": "ChaFod2", "description": "Changes the selection of food based on the customer's request, ensuring the food name provided is in uppercase as per the requirement.Example: ChaFod({'TheFod': 'PIZZA'})\n\nExample: ChaFod({'TheFod': 'BURGER'})\n\nExample: ChaFod({'TheFod': 'SALAD'})\n\nExample: ChaFod({'TheFod': 'SOUP'})\n\nExample: ChaFod({'TheFod': 'STEAK'})", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["TheFod"], "properties": {"TheFod": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the food to be changed, provided in uppercase letters only (e.g., 'PIZZA', 'BURGER').", "enum": ["PIZZA", "BURGER", "SALAD", "SOUP", "STEAK"]}}}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"ChaFod1": {"TheFod": "GREENS"}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"ChaFod1": {"TheFod": "GREENS"}}], "possible_answer": [{"ChaFod1": {"TheFod": ["SALAD"]}}, {"ChaFod2": {"TheFod": ["SALAD"]}}, {"ChaFod3": {"TheFod": ["SALAD"]}}]}

Returns an empty string if the LLM output is 'answer not found'.This function serves the important role of analyzing and evaluating the output produced by a Language Learning Model (LLM) to ensure that it meets certain criteria of validity. Upon receiving the generated answer from the LLM, the function performs a parsing operation to dissect and comprehend the structure and content of the response.\n\nThe primary purpose of the parsing process is to detect whether the LLM's output includes a specific phrase indicating that the desired answer could not be determined. Specifically, the function is designed to identify the occurrence of the phrase 'answer not found' within the LLM's output. If this exact phrase is detected, it signifies that the LLM was unable to formulate a valid or relevant response to the query it was given.\n\nIn such cases where the phrase 'answer not found' is present, the function will not proceed with any further validation processes or attempt to interpret the response as meaningful information. Instead, it will promptly return an empty string. This return value of an empty string serves as a clear indicator to the calling process or user that the LLM was unable to generate a suitable answer to the input query.\n\nThe function is particularly useful in scenarios where it is crucial to distinguish between valid, informative outputs and instances where the LLM acknowledges its limitations in understanding or responding to a given query.

This frequency is particularly relevant in applications such as radio transmitters and receivers, filters, and oscillators.\n\nTo determine the resonant frequency, the function uses the standard formula for the resonant frequency of an LC circuit, which is given by:\n\n\\[ f_r = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\sqrt{L \\cdot C}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( f_r \\) is the resonant frequency in hertz (Hz),\n- \\( L \\) is the inductance in henries (H),\n- \\( C \\) is the capacitance in farads (F),\n- \\( \\pi \\) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159.\n\nWhen using this function, it is important to provide the values of the inductor and capacitor in their respective units to ensure the correct calculation of the resonant frequency. The function typically checks for valid input values, as negative or zero values for inductance or capacitance would not be physically meaningful and would result in mathematical errors such as division by zero or square root of a negative number.\n\nUsage example:\nSuppose you have an LC circuit with an inductance of 0.005 henries (5 milliHenries) and a capacitance of 0.000001 farads (1 microFarad). By passing these values to the function, it will compute the resonant frequency as follows:\n\n\\[ f_r = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\sqrt{0.005 \\cdot 0.000001}} \\]\n\nThis example demonstrates how the function utilizes the input parameters to provide the resonant frequency, allowing engineers and hobbyists", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"inductance": {"type": "float", "description": "The inductance (L) in henries (H)."}, "capacitance": {"type": "float", "description": "The capacitance (C) in farads (F)."}, "round_off": {"type": "integer", "description": "Rounding off the result to a certain decimal places, default is 2."}}, "required": ["inductance", "capacitance"]}}, {"name": "calculate_resonant_frequency2", "description": "Calculate the resonant frequency of an LC (inductor-capacitor) circuit.Example: calculate_resonant_frequency(inductance=0.01, capacitance=0.001) returns 1591.55\n\nExample: calculate_resonant_frequency(inductance=0.05, capacitance=0.002, round_off=3) returns 504.647", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"inductance": {"type": "float", "description": "The inductance (L) in henries (H)."}, "capacitance": {"type": "float", "description": "The capacitance (C) in farads (F)."}, "round_off": {"type": "integer", "description": "Rounding off the result to a certain decimal places, default is 2."}}, "required": ["inductance", "capacitance"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"calculate_resonant_frequency2": {"inductance": 0.05, "capacitance": 1e-06}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"calculate_resonant_frequency2": {"inductance": 0.05, "capacitance": 1e-06}}], "possible_answer": [{"calculate_resonant_frequency1": {"inductance": [0.05], "capacitance": [0.0001], "round_off": ["", 2]}}, {"calculate_resonant_frequency2": {"inductance": [0.05], "capacitance": [0.0001], "round_off": ["", 2]}}, {"calculate_resonant_frequency3": {"inductance": [0.05], "capacitance": [0.0001], "round_off": ["", 2]}}]}

In thermodynamics, entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness in a system, and understanding changes in entropy is crucial for analyzing energy exchanges in various physical and chemical processes.\n\nFor an isothermal process, the temperature remains constant throughout the entire process. This condition is significant because it allows simplifications in the calculation of entropy. The function assumes that the system is in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings, maintaining a constant temperature.\n\nIn addition to being isothermal, the process is also reversible. A reversible process is an idealized concept in thermodynamics where the system changes in such a way that both the system and its surroundings can be returned to their original states with no net change. Reversible processes are an important theoretical model because they represent the maximum efficiency with which energy can be converted or transferred.\n\nTo calculate the entropy change, the function uses the formula:\n\n\\[ \\Delta S = \\frac{Q_{\\text{rev}}}{T} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\Delta S \\) is the change in entropy.\n- \\( Q_{\\text{rev}} \\) is the amount of heat absorbed or released by the system during the reversible process.\n- \\( T \\) is the absolute temperature at which the process occurs.\n\nThis formula highlights the direct relationship between the heat exchanged and entropy change for a reversible process: the greater the amount of heat exchanged at a given temperature, the greater the change in entropy.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\nConsider a system where 500 J of heat is absorbed from a reservoir at a constant temperature of 300 K.

This predictive capability leverages a model trained on a dataset that correlates these physical attributes with the incidence of diabetes type 2, thus providing a probabilistic assessment.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `weight`: This parameter represents the individual\u2019s weight, typically measured in kilograms or pounds. It is crucial to ensure that the weight input is accurately measured and converted to the appropriate unit to maintain the integrity of the prediction.\n- `height`: The height of the individual is another critical input, usually recorded in meters or inches. Similar to weight, the height should be precisely measured and standardized to the unit expected by the function for consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Functionality:**\n- The function processes these inputs through a computational model, which likely involves statistical or machine learning algorithms trained to recognize patterns between body mass index (BMI), calculated from height and weight, and the predisposition to Type 2 diabetes.\n- The output is a probability score that indicates the likelihood of the individual developing diabetes type 2. This score is typically a value between 0 and 1, where a higher value suggests an increased risk.\n\n**Edge Cases and Considerations:**\n- Ensure that the input values for weight and height are within a reasonable range to avoid skewed predictions. Extremely low or high values may not be within the valid range that the model was trained on and could lead to inaccurate predictions.\n- Consider the unit consistency for weight and height. If the function expects metric units, then inputs should be converted accordingly if they are initially provided in imperial units.\n- The function does not account for other risk factors such as age, family history, or lifestyle, which are also significant contributors to the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.

The function's operation is contingent upon a specified parameter or flag which determines the order of sorting. \n\nWhen the ascending order is chosen, the function rearranges the list so that each element is less than or equal to the element that follows it. This means numbers will start from the smallest and increment to the largest, or strings will proceed alphabetically from A to Z.

Allows for the bulk recording of query classifications in one function call.This function is designed to efficiently manage and record the classification of a large number of queries by associating them with specific intent names. It achieves this by leveraging keyword arguments, where each keyword corresponds to an intent name, and the associated value is a collection of queries that share this intent. By using this approach, users can perform bulk recordings of query classifications in a single function call, significantly streamlining the process.\n\n### Parameters\n\n- **intent_name**: Keyword arguments where each keyword represents the name of an intent. This acts as a label that describes the purpose or goal of the queries associated with it.\n\n- **queries**: The values that accompany each intent name keyword argument. These are the actual queries that need to be classified. They can be provided in various iterable forms, such as lists or tuples, allowing for flexibility in input data structures.\n\n### Functionality\n\nWhen you call this function, it processes each keyword argument, taking the name of the keyword as the intent and the corresponding value as the list of queries. The function then records the association between each query and its intent, effectively classifying them in bulk. This method is particularly useful for applications that require organizing a large number of queries systematically, such as natural language processing tasks, chatbots, or automated customer service systems.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- If no queries are provided for a given intent, the function will simply record the intent with an empty list of queries, ensuring that all intents are processed but without any associated data.\n  \n- If duplicate queries are provided under the same intent, the function will still record each instance, as this might be intentional depending on the use case (e.g., tracking frequency of certain queries).\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\n# Example of how to call the function with multiple intents and their associated queries\nrecord_classifications(\n    greeting=[\"Hello\", \"Hi there\", \"Good morning\"],\n    farewell=[\"Goodbye\", \"See you later\", \"Take care\"],\n    inquiry=[\"What's the weather", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["acc_routing_start", "atm_finder_start", "faq_link_accounts_start", "get_balance_start", "get_transactions_start", "outofscope"], "properties": {"acc_routing_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries requesting the bank routing numbers or account numbers."}, "atm_finder_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for locations of ATMs, specified in the format of 'City, State (abbr)', such as 'Berkeley, CA' or 'New York, NY'."}, "faq_link_accounts_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to linking accounts within the bank's system."}, "get_balance_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for account balances, available funds, or other financial balances."}, "get_transactions_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to viewing transactions, deposits, purchases, and transaction details."}, "outofscope": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries that do not classify to any other available intents."}}}}, {"name": "record2", "description": "Records classifications for a series of queries based on the intent names provided as keyword arguments.

The function then calculates a test statistic based on the data from the two samples, which can be compared to a critical value from a statistical distribution (such as the t-distribution or z-distribution) to assess the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis.\n\nKey parameters that might be involved in this function include the sample means, sample sizes, and standard deviations of the two groups. Additionally, the function may require a significance level (commonly denoted as alpha), which is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true, often set at 0.05 or 5%. \n\nAn important aspect of this function is ensuring that the samples are indeed independent, meaning the sample from one group does not influence or affect the sample from the other group.

The primary purpose of this function is to run commands directly in the operating system's command-line interface (CLI), which is generally the Command Prompt on Windows.\n\nA notable feature of this function is its ability to execute not just a single command, but also multiple commands chained together. This chaining is accomplished using the '&&' operator, which allows for the sequential execution of commands.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.This function is designed to execute a system-level command by leveraging the `os.system()` function available in the Python standard library. It is specifically tailored for use on Windows operating systems. The `os.system()` function allows Python code to interact with the underlying operating system to execute commands as if they were being run from the command prompt.\n\nWhen utilizing this function, you can execute a single command directly. For example, you might execute a command such as `dir` to list directory contents. The function also supports the execution of multiple commands in a single call. This is achieved by chaining commands together using the logical 'AND' operator `&&`. This operator ensures that each subsequent command is executed only if the preceding command completes successfully without errors.\n\nFor instance, you can execute a series of commands such as `cd / && dir` where the `cd /` command will change the directory to the root directory, and if successful, the `dir` command will list the directory contents. This chaining capability provides a powerful way to perform a series of operations sequentially, with each command being contingent on the success of the previous one.\n\nIt is important to note that the execution of these commands occurs in a subshell, and the function will wait for the command(s) to complete before returning. Since this function uses `os.system()`, the return value will be the exit status of the command executed. An exit status of `0` typically indicates success, while any non-zero value indicates an error.\n\nThis function is suitable for executing commands that do not require real-time interaction with the user, as `os.system()` does not provide direct access to input and output streams of the executed command.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

It serves as a valuable tool for determining the depth of a lawyer's expertise in specific legal domains, which can be crucial for potential clients, law firms, or legal evaluators who are assessing the suitability of a lawyer for a case or position.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **lawyer_id**: A unique identifier for the lawyer whose experience is being queried. This could be a numerical ID or a string, depending on the system's database setup.\n- **case_type**: A string that specifies the type of legal case or field of law in question, such as \"criminal\", \"corporate\", \"family\", etc. This parameter helps narrow down the experience to relevant cases only.\n\n#### Returns:\n- **months_of_experience**: An integer representing the total number of months the specified lawyer has been actively involved in handling cases of the specified type. This output is calculated by aggregating all relevant case durations from the lawyer's case history.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nSuppose you have a lawyer with the ID `12345` and you want to find out how many months of experience they have handling \"corporate\" law cases.

The calculation is based on three crucial parameters: the distance traveled by the vehicle in that year, the type of fuel the vehicle uses, and the fuel efficiency of the vehicle.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n1. **Distance Traveled**: This parameter represents the total number of miles or kilometers the vehicle has traveled in a year. It is a critical factor, as greater distances typically result in higher emissions.\n\n2. **Fuel Type**: The type of fuel the vehicle uses significantly impacts the calculation. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, electric, and hybrid options. Each fuel type has a specific carbon emissions factor, which denotes the amount of carbon dioxide produced per unit of fuel consumed. This emissions factor is essential for accurately estimating the vehicle's carbon footprint.\n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency**: This represents how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel, usually expressed in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). Higher fuel efficiency indicates that the vehicle can travel further on a smaller amount of fuel, potentially reducing the total emissions.\n\n**Calculation Process:**\n\nThe function combines these parameters to estimate the annual carbon dioxide emissions. It considers the distance traveled and divides it by the vehicle's fuel efficiency to determine the total fuel consumed over the year. This result is then multiplied by the carbon emissions factor associated with the selected fuel type to calculate the total emissions in terms of carbon dioxide.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n- If the distance traveled is zero, the function should correctly return zero emissions, as no travel means no fuel consumption or emissions.\n- If the fuel efficiency is excessively high, it could result in minimal emissions even for significant travel distances, which should be correctly processed.\n- Different fuel types with different emissions factors must be handled accurately to reflect real-world differences in carbon output.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\nSuppose a vehicle travels 15,000 kilometers in", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"distance": {"type": "integer", "description": "The distance travelled in miles."}, "fuel_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of fuel used by the vehicle."}, "fuel_efficiency": {"type": "float", "description": "The vehicle's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon."}, "efficiency_reduction": {"type": "integer", "description": "The percentage decrease in fuel efficiency per year (optional).

This function leverages available data sources and statistical models to provide an approximation that can assist researchers, conservationists, and policy-makers in understanding the current status of the species in question.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **species_name**: A string representing the common or scientific name of the species for which the population estimate is desired. It is crucial that the name is accurate and corresponds to the recognized nomenclature to ensure the retrieval of relevant data.\n  \n- **country_name**: A string that specifies the name of the country where the population of the species is to be estimated. The country name should match the internationally recognized English spelling to avoid discrepancies in data sourcing.\n\n#### Functionality:\nUpon execution, the function accesses various ecological and environmental databases that track species populations and biodiversity metrics. It applies statistical algorithms that consider factors such as habitat size, known population densities, migration patterns, and any available historical data on population trends and threats, such as habitat loss or climate change impacts. The function may also integrate remote sensing data or citizen science reports to refine its estimates.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- **Data Availability**: In situations where data for a specific species-country combination is sparse or non-existent, the function may return a result with a higher degree of uncertainty. Researchers should be prepared to interpret such outputs with caution.\n  \n- **Species Identification**: Ensuring the correct identification of species is critical. Misidentification can lead to inaccurate estimates and potentially misinform conservation strategies.\n\n- **Country Boundaries**: Political or geographical changes may affect the accuracy of estimates if historical data correspond to different territorial boundaries.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n```python\n# Estimating the population of the African Elephant in Kenya\npopulation_estimate = estimate_species_population(species_name=\"African Elephant\", country_name=\"Kenya\")\nprint(f\"", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"species": {"type": "string", "description": "The species for which population needs to be estimated."}, "country": {"type": "string", "description": "The country where the species lives."}, "year": {"type": "integer", "description": "The year for which population estimate is sought.

The primary purpose of this function is to handle raw fMRI data, which may consist of complex time-series information captured from brain scans, and apply various analytical techniques to extract meaningful insights. \n\n#### Input\n- **fMRI Data**: The function accepts fMRI data, which typically comprises three-dimensional or four-dimensional datasets that represent brain activity over time. This data is usually formatted in standard neuroimaging file formats, such as NIfTI or DICOM. The input may also contain metadata that provides additional context or information necessary for proper analysis.\n\n#### Process\n- The function employs a series of analytical methods to process the input data. These methods may include pre-processing steps such as motion correction, spatial normalization, and temporal filtering. The analysis may also involve statistical techniques to identify patterns of brain activity, connectivity assessments to examine neural networks, or machine learning approaches to classify or predict specific cognitive states or responses.\n\n#### Output\n- **Analyzed Data**: The result of the function is a set of analyzed data that provides insights into the brain's activity patterns. This output can be in the form of statistical maps, graphs representing neural connectivity, or other data visualizations that highlight significant findings. The analyzed data is typically ready for further interpretation by researchers or clinicians.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n- The function should handle cases where the input data is incomplete or contains artifacts that could affect analysis. It should be robust enough to manage variability in data quality and accommodate different scanning protocols or resolutions.\n\n#### Usage Example\n```python\n# Example usage of the function\nraw_fmri_data = load_fmri_data(file_path)\nanalyzed_results = analyze_fmri_data(raw_fmri_data)\ndisplay_results(analyzed_results)\n```\n\nThis function is essential for neuroscientists and researchers who require efficient and accurate", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"data_source": {"type": "string", "description": "The path where the data is stored."}, "sequence_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of fMRI sequence"}, "smooth": {"type": "integer", "description": "Spatial smoothing FWHM.

It is essential for the function to consider these limitations and provide appropriate feedback or fallbacks.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\n```python\n# Example usage of the search_and_play function\nsearch_and_play(\"Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the function would search Spotify for the song \"Bohemian Rhapsody\"", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["query"], "properties": {"query": {"type": "string", "description": "The search query for the song.

After identifying the desired song from the search results, the function proceeds to initiate playback of the selected song. \n\nThe query parameter is critical, as it determines the accuracy and relevance of the search results. It is important for the user to be as specific as possible to increase the likelihood of finding the exact song they intend to listen to. For example, if the query is simply \"Hello,\" the search might return multiple songs with similar titles, potentially from different artists, whereas a query like \"Hello Adele\" would more directly target the intended song.\n\nThis function assumes that the user has a valid Spotify account and is logged into the application, as well as that they have given the necessary permissions for the function to access their Spotify account and control playback. Additionally, the function requires a stable internet connection to communicate with Spotify's servers and stream the music content.\n\nAn edge case to consider is that if the query does not match any song in Spotify's database, the function may either return an error or perform no action at all.

It is particularly useful for managers, team leads, or project coordinators who need an overview of the projects their team is currently involved in. The function includes optional parameters that allow users to customize the list according to specific needs, improving the relevance and clarity of the information retrieved.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **team_id**: The unique identifier for the team whose projects are being queried. This parameter is mandatory and serves as the primary filter for the function, ensuring that only projects linked to this specific team are returned.\n\n- **exclude_inactive** (optional): A boolean parameter that, when set to `true`, will exclude any projects that are marked as inactive. This is useful for users who are only interested in active projects that require attention and resources. By default, this parameter is set to `false`, meaning that inactive projects will be included in the results unless this option is explicitly enabled.\n\n- **exclude_child_projects** (optional): Another boolean parameter that allows users to exclude child projects from the list. Child projects are typically those that are part of a larger parent project. Users might choose to exclude these to focus on standalone projects or parent projects. The default value for this parameter is `false`, indicating that child projects will be included unless the user specifies otherwise.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- If the `team_id` provided does not correspond to any existing team, the function may return an empty list or an error message, depending on implementation details.\n\n- When both `exclude_inactive` and `exclude_child_projects` are set to `true`, the resulting list will contain only active, standalone projects associated with the specified team.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose a project manager wants to retrieve a list of all active projects for Team Alpha without any child projects.

Examples might include 'regular', 'playoffs', 'championship', or specific league identifiers like 'Premier League', 'NBA', etc.\n   - **Purpose**: The type parameter is essential in tailoring the ranking retrieval method, as different leagues might have unique rules, scoring methods, or ranking algorithms. For instance, some leagues might prioritize wins while others might emphasize goal differences or total points.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\nUpon calling this function with the appropriate parameters for the season and type, it processes the league data to determine the ranking of the team. The function accesses the relevant historical or ongoing data specific to the inputs provided. It then applies the league's ranking methodology to output the desired ranking information. This could involve sorting teams based on accumulated points, win-loss records, goal differentials, or other performance indicators, depending on the league's rules.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Seasonal Data Availability**: If the specified season", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"team_name": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the sports team."}, "league": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the league in which the team competes."}, "season": {"type": "string", "description": "The season for which the team's ranking is sought."}, "type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of the season: regular or playoff.", "enum": ["regular", "playoff"]}}, "required": ["team_name", "league", "season", "type"]}}, {"name": "get_team_rank2", "description": "Get the team ranking in a sports league based on season and type.Example: get_team_rank(team_name='Lions', league='National Basketball League', season='2023', type='regular') returns 3.\n\nExample: get_team_rank(team_name='Sharks', league='Premier League Soccer', season='2022', type='playoff') returns 1.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"team_name": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the sports team."}, "league": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the league in which the team competes."}, "season": {"type": "string", "description": "The season for which the team's ranking is sought."}, "type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of the season: regular or playoff.", "enum": ["regular", "playoff"]}}, "required": ["team_name", "league", "season", "type"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"get_team_rank2": {"team_name": "Lakers", "league": "NBA", "season": "2021", "type": "regular"}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"get_team_rank2": {"team_name": "Lakers", "league": "NBA", "season": "2021", "type": "regular"}}], "possible_answer": [{"get_team_rank1": {"team_name": ["LA Lakers"], "league": ["NBA"], "season": ["2021"], "type": ["regular"]}}, {"get_team_rank2": {"team_name": ["LA Lakers"], "league": ["NBA"], "season": ["2021"], "type": ["regular"]}}, {"get_team_rank3": {"team_name": ["LA Lakers"], "league": ["NBA"], "season": ["2021"], "type": ["regular"]}}]}

Blackjack is a popular card game where the main objective is to achieve a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. In a standard game, players compete against the dealer rather than each other, trying to either beat the dealer\u2019s hand or have the dealer bust (go over 21).\n\n#### Key Functionalities:\n1. **Assessing Hand Values**: The function calculates the total value of both the player's and the dealer's hands by summing the values of the individual cards. Special attention is given to the Ace card, which can be counted as either 1 or 11, depending on which value keeps the hand total closest to 21 without busting.\n\n2. **Bust Condition**: If either the player's or dealer's hand exceeds a total of 21, it is considered a \u2018bust,\u2019 and the other party automatically wins, provided they have a valid hand. The function ensures that this rule is rigorously applied to determine the winner.\n\n3. **Comparing Hand Values**: In cases where no bust occurs, the function compares the hand values. The hand with a total closer to 21 is determined to be the winner. It also handles the scenario where both hands have the same value, which typically results in a \u2018push\u2019 or tie, where neither party wins.\n\n4. **Blackjack Condition**: If a player or dealer achieves a hand value of exactly 21 with their initial two cards (usually an Ace and a 10-value card), it is considered a \u2018blackjack,\u2019 and this hand typically beats all other 21-value hands that are not blackjacks. The function incorporates this rule in determining the outcome.\n\n#### Edge Cases Handled:\n- If both the dealer and player bust, the function will determine the winner based on the specific rules of the game implemented, which can vary; generally, this", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"player_cards": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "Cards held by the player."}, "dealer_cards": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "Cards held by the dealer."}, "ace_value": {"type": "integer", "description": "The value considered for the ace card, can be either 1 or 11.", "default": 11}}, "required": ["player_cards", "dealer_cards"]}}, {"name": "blackjack.check_winner2", "description": "Checks and determines the winner in a game of blackjack.Example: blackjack.check_winner(player_cards=['10', 'K'], dealer_cards=['9', '7']) returns 'Player wins'\n\nExample: blackjack.check_winner(player_cards=['8', 'A'], dealer_cards=['10', '7'], ace_value=11) returns 'Dealer wins'\n\nExample: blackjack.check_winner(player_cards=['7', '2', 'A'], dealer_cards=['6', '5', '3'], ace_value=1) returns 'Player wins'\n\nExample: blackjack.check_winner(player_cards=['A', 'J'], dealer_cards=['A', 'Q']) returns 'Push'", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"player_cards": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "Cards held by the player."}, "dealer_cards": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "Cards held by the dealer."}, "ace_value": {"type": "integer", "description": "The value considered for the ace card, can be either 1 or 11.", "default": 11}}, "required": ["player_cards", "dealer_cards"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"blackjack.check_winner1": {"player_cards": ["A", "10"], "dealer_cards": ["10", "9"], "ace_value": 11}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"blackjack.check_winner1": {"player_cards": ["A", "10"], "dealer_cards": ["10", "9"], "ace_value": 11}}], "possible_answer": [{"blackjack.check_winner1": {"player_cards": [["A", "10"]], "dealer_cards": [["10", "9"]], "ace_value": [1]}}, {"blackjack.check_winner2": {"player_cards": [["A", "10"]], "dealer_cards": [["10", "9"]], "ace_value": [1]}}, {"blackjack.check_winner3": {"player_cards": [["A", "10"]], "dealer_cards": [["10", "9"]], "ace_value": [1]}}]}

A full house is a hand consisting of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank, such as three 10s and two 8s. The calculation involves determining the number of ways to draw such a hand from a 52-card deck.\n\nTo achieve this, the function first calculates the number of ways to choose a rank for the three-of-a-kind portion of the hand, which can be done in 13 ways (one for each rank). For each chosen rank, there are \\(\\binom{4}{3}\\) ways to select three cards of that rank, since there are four suits in a deck.\n\nNext, the function calculates the number of ways to choose a different rank for the pair portion of the hand, which can be done in 12 ways (since one rank is already used for the three-of-a-kind). For each chosen rank for the pair, there are \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) ways to select two cards from the four available suits.\n\nThe total number of full house combinations is then given by multiplying these possibilities: \\(13 \\times \\binom{4}{3} \\times 12 \\times \\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nFinally, to find the probability, this total is divided by the total number of 5-card hand combinations from a 52-card deck, which is \\(\\binom{52}{5}\\).\n\nAn edge case to consider is ensuring the distinction between the rank chosen for the three-of-a-kind and the rank chosen for the pair, as they must be different.

This parameter is crucial as it narrows down the search to a specific geographic location, ensuring that the recommendations are relevant to the user's needs.\n\n- The second parameter, `review_rate`, is a numeric value that determines the minimum average review rating that a sushi place must have to be considered in the results. This parameter helps filter out sushi restaurants that do not meet a certain quality standard, as perceived by previous customers. It ensures that only sushi places with a review rating equal to or higher than this specified value are included in the final output.\n\n- The third parameter, `top number`, is an integer that indicates the number of top sushi places to return. This parameter allows users to limit the number of results based on their preference. For example, if a user only wants to see the top 5 sushi places, they would set this parameter to 5. The function then provides a list containing the specified number of sushi restaurants, ranked according to their ratings and other relevant criteria.\n\nBy combining these parameters, the function is able to generate a tailored list of sushi restaurants that are highly regarded within the specified city and meet or exceed the given review rate.

This operation involves taking each item in a provided list, checking its individual price, and then multiplying that price by the number of units specified for that item. By iterating through each item and applying this calculation, the function aggregates the costs into a single sum representing the total expenditure for the specified items and quantities.\n\nParameters:\n- `items`: A list containing all the items for which the total price needs to be calculated. Each element in the list is expected to have an associated unit price.\n- `quantities`: A corresponding list of quantities that specifies how many units of each item are being purchased. Each quantity in this list should map directly to an item in the `items` list.\n\nConsiderations:\n- Both the `items` and `quantities` lists must have the same length, as each item must have an associated quantity to ensure an accurate calculation.\n- If there are any discrepancies in list lengths, or if an item does not have a defined price, the function may need to handle such cases, potentially by raising an error or ignoring the mismatched entries.\n- The function assumes that all prices are accurate and up-to-date as per Walmart's current listings.\n\nExample Usage:\nSuppose the `items` list is `[\"apple\", \"banana\", \"milk\"]` and the corresponding `quantities` list is `[3, 2, 1]`. If the prices at Walmart for each unit are $1, $0.5, and $2 respectively, the function will calculate the total price as follows:\n- For apples: 3 x $1 = $3\n- For bananas: 2 x $0.5 = $1\n- For milk: 1 x $2 = $2\nAdding these amounts gives a total of $6.
