This slope represents the rate at which the function's value changes with respect to changes in the input variable, providing insight into the function's behavior and trends near the given value.\n\nTo compute the derivative at a specific value, the function typically requires two primary inputs: the function itself, which can be expressed in terms of a mathematical expression or an algorithmic form, and the specific value of the input variable at which the derivative is to be calculated. Depending on the method employed, additional parameters might be needed, such as the differentiation method (symbolic or numerical) or precision settings for numerical differentiation.\n\nWhen performing symbolic differentiation, the derivative is computed by analytically manipulating the function's expression, following rules of calculus, to obtain a new function representing the derivative. This new function is then evaluated at the desired specific value.\n\nAlternatively, numerical differentiation involves approximating the derivative using numerical methods, such as the finite difference method. This approach is particularly useful when the function is not easily expressed symbolically or when working with data points. In this case, the derivative is estimated by calculating the ratio of changes in the function's output to small changes in the input variable near the specific value.\n\nConsiderations to keep in mind include the potential for numerical instability or inaccuracies in the presence of round-off errors when using numerical methods. Additionally, certain functions may exhibit discontinuities or sharp turns at the specific value, which could affect the derivative's computation and interpretation.\n\nUsage examples typically involve scenarios such as determining the velocity of an object at a particular time given", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"function": {"type": "string", "description": "The function to calculate the derivative of."}, "value": {"type": "integer", "description": "The value where the derivative needs to be calculated at."}, "function_variable": {"type": "string", "description": "The variable present in the function, for instance x or y, etc. Default is 'x'."}}, "required": ["function", "value"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\nThe derivative of the function 2x\u00b2 at x = 1 is calculated using the power rule.

This is a critical operation in various areas of mathematics and computer science, such as cryptography, number theory, and algorithm design.\n\nThe function works by iterating through possible divisors, starting from the smallest prime number, which is 2.

Entropy, a measure of disorder or randomness in a system, is a fundamental concept in thermodynamics, particularly in understanding energy distribution and efficiency.\n\n### Parameters\n\n- **initial_temperature (T)**: This parameter represents the constant temperature at which the process occurs. It is crucial that this temperature remains constant throughout the process to ensure it is isothermal. The temperature is generally expressed in Kelvin (K) to maintain consistency with thermodynamic calculations.\n\n- **heat_transfer (Q)**: The heat transferred into or out of the system during the process. For a reversible process, this transfer must occur in such a way that the system remains in equilibrium with its surroundings at every stage. The heat transfer is typically measured in joules (J).\n\n### Calculation Details\n\nThe entropy change for an isothermal and reversible process is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta S = \\frac{Q}{T}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\Delta S \\) is the change in entropy.\n- \\( Q \\) is the heat transferred.\n- \\( T \\) is the constant absolute temperature at which the process occurs.\n\n### Edge Cases and Considerations\n\n- **Zero Heat Transfer**: If the heat transfer (\\( Q \\)) is zero, the change in entropy (\\( \\Delta S \\)) will also be zero. This occurs when no energy enters or leaves the system as heat, which could be a hypothetical scenario in a perfectly isolated system.\n\n- **Negative Heat Transfer**: In cases where heat is removed from the system (\\( Q \\) is negative), the entropy change will also be negative, indicating a decrease in the system's disorder as it loses energy.\n\n- **Temperature Constraints**: The function assumes that the input temperature (\\( T \\)) is", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"initial_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial temperature in Kelvin."}, "final_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The final temperature in Kelvin."}, "heat_capacity": {"type": "integer", "description": "The heat capacity in J/K."}, "isothermal": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether the process is isothermal.

This single-value constraint ensures that you avoid any potential conflicts or errors that might arise from attempting to send multiple commands simultaneously. \n\nFor example, if you intend to send a command to turn on the appliance, you would call this function and pass the specific value associated with the \"on\" command. Similarly, if you need to adjust a setting, such as temperature or speed, you would send a single value corresponding to the desired setting.\n\nParameters:\n- `command`: This parameter represents the single value that you send. It should be formatted according to the specifications required by the appliance, which may vary depending on the appliance's make and model.\n\nUsage Example:\nConsider a scenario where you want to change the volume level on a smart speaker. Here, you would call this function with the appropriate value that corresponds to the desired volume setting, ensuring that only this value is transmitted during the call.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["body"], "properties": {"body": {"type": "dict", "description": "A dictionary containing the parameters for the appliance command.", "properties": {"airConJobMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The current job mode of the air conditioner.", "enum": ["AIR_CLEAN", "COOL", "AIR_DRY"], "default": "COOL"}, "windStrength": {"type": "string", "description": "The strength of the air flow.", "enum": ["LOW", "HIGH", "MID"], "default": "MID"}, "monitoringEnabled": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether air quality sensor monitoring is enabled.", "default": false}, "airCleanOperationMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The operation mode for the air cleaning function.", "enum": ["START", "STOP"], "default": "STOP"}, "airConOperationMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The operation mode for the air conditioner, indicating if it is turned on or off.", "enum": ["POWER_ON", "POWER_OFF"], "default": "POWER_OFF"}, "powerSaveEnabled": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether power save mode is enabled to conserve energy.", "default": false}, "targetTemperature": {"type": "integer", "description": "The target temperature to set for the appliance, in degrees Celsius.", "default": 20}, "relativeHourToStop": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of hours from the current time when the appliance should stop.

Additionally, this function does not modify the original list; instead, it returns a new list that reflects the sorted order. \n\nHere is an example of how you might call this function in a program:\n\n```python\n# Assuming 'sort_list' is the name of the function\nnumbers = [4, 2, 9, 1]\nsorted_numbers = sort_list(numbers)  # Sorts in ascending order by default\nprint(sorted_numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 4, 9]\n\n# To sort in descending order\nsorted_numbers_desc = sort_list(numbers, descending=True)\nprint(sorted_numbers_desc)  # Output: [9, 4, 2, 1]\n```\n\nIn this example, the list `numbers` is sorted in ascending order by default. By passing an additional argument, the list can also be sorted in descending order, demonstrating the function's flexibility.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"list": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "float"}, "description": "The list of numbers to be sorted."}, "order": {"type": "string", "enum": ["ascending", "descending"], "description": "Order of sorting."}}, "required": ["list", "order"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\nThe list [5, 3, 4, 1, 2] can be sorted in ascending order using either function.

Additionally, the hour hand moves incrementally with the minutes within the hour, progressing at 0.5 degrees per minute.

The most commonly used formula for calculating the area is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\]\n\nIn this formula, the base represents the length of one of the triangle's sides, and the height is the perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite vertex. This method is applicable when both the base and the height are known.\n\n**Parameters**:\n- **base**: A numerical value representing the length of the base of the triangle. It should be a positive number.\n- **height**: A numerical value denoting the height of the triangle, which is the perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite vertex. This should also be a positive number.\n\n**Returns**:\n- The function returns a numerical value that represents the area of the triangle. The result is calculated based on the formula mentioned above and is expressed in square units derived from the units of the base and height.\n\n**Edge Cases**:\n- If either the base or height is zero or negative, the function may return zero or raise an error, depending on the implementation.

The Random Forest algorithm is a popular ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. It is widely used for its ability to handle large datasets with higher dimensions and for its robustness against overfitting.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **data**: The dataset on which the Random Forest model will be trained. This should include both predictor variables (features) and target variables (labels), formatted as a DataFrame or a similar tabular structure. The dataset should be pre-processed before being passed to the function, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing or standardizing features if necessary.\n\n- **n_estimators** (optional): An integer specifying the number of trees in the forest. More trees generally improve the performance but also increase computational cost and memory usage. A typical default value is 100, but this can be adjusted based on dataset size and performance considerations.\n\n- **max_depth** (optional): The maximum depth of the tree. Limiting the depth can prevent overfitting, especially with smaller datasets. If not specified, nodes are expanded until all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain fewer than `min_samples_split` samples.\n\n- **random_state** (optional): Controls the randomness of the bootstrapping of the samples and the selection of features when looking for the best split at each node. Setting this parameter ensures reproducibility of results.\n\n#### Returns:\n\n- **model**: The trained Random Forest model object. This object can be used to make predictions on new data using the `predict` method, and it can be further evaluated using metrics such as accuracy for classification tasks or mean squared error for regression tasks.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nHere is a basic example of how this function might be used in practice:", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"n_estimators": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of trees in the forest."}, "max_depth": {"type": "integer", "description": "The maximum depth of the tree."}, "data": {"type": "any", "description": "The training data for the model."}}, "required": ["n_estimators", "max_depth", "data"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\n[ random_forest.train1(n_estimators=100, max_depth=5, data=my_data) ]", "possible_answer": [{"random_forest.train1": {"n_estimators": [100], "max_depth": [5], "data": ["my_data"]}}, {"random_forest.train2": {"n_estimators": [100], "max_depth": [5], "data": ["my_data"]}}, {"random_forest.train3": {"n_estimators": [100], "max_depth": [5], "data": ["my_data"]}}]}

Allows for the bulk recording of query classifications in one function call.This function is designed to efficiently handle the task of recording classifications for a series of queries, which is particularly valuable in scenarios involving natural language processing or machine learning applications where intents need to be identified and stored. The function achieves this by taking in a series of queries and corresponding intent names, which are provided as keyword arguments. This setup enables users to specify intent names for each query in a clear and organized manner. \n\nBy allowing intent names to be passed as keyword arguments, the function provides flexibility and clarity in associating each query with its intended classification. This approach eliminates the need for multiple individual function calls for each query, thereby streamlining the process and enhancing code readability. Users can leverage this function to record multiple query classifications simultaneously, making it ideal for bulk processing applications where efficiency and speed are crucial.\n\nAn edge case to consider when using this function is ensuring that the intent names provided match the expected format or predefined categories used within the application or system.

The coefficient of determination is a statistical measure that is used to assess the goodness of fit of the model, indicating how well the observed outcomes are replicated by the model given the input data. R\u00b2 values range from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 implies that the regression model perfectly predicts the dependent variable, and a value of 0 indicates that the model does not predict the dependent variable at all.\n\nThis function typically requires two key inputs: the actual observed values and the predicted values produced by the regression model. The actual values represent the true data points for the dependent variable, while the predicted values are the estimates generated by the model based on the independent variables.\n\nThe function works by comparing the variance of the residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values) to the variance of the observed data. It calculates the total sum of squares (TSS), which represents the total variance in the observed data, and the residual sum of squares (RSS), which measures the variance explained by the model's errors. R\u00b2 is then computed as:\n\nR\u00b2 = 1 - (RSS / TSS)\n\nThis formula provides the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. In practical terms, a higher R\u00b2 value generally indicates a better fit of the model to the data, suggesting that a larger proportion of the variance in the dependent variable is captured by the model. However, it is important to note that a high R\u00b2 does not necessarily imply that the model is appropriate or free from bias, and other statistical measures should also be considered when evaluating the performance of a regression model.\n\nUsage Example:\nSuppose you have a dataset containing actual sales figures and corresponding predicted sales figures from a regression model. You can use this function to determine how well your model predicts sales by feeding these two datasets into the function to obtain the R\u00b2 value.\n\nIn", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"dataset_path": {"type": "string", "description": "Path to the CSV dataset file."}, "independent_variables": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "The independent variables to use in the regression model."}, "dependent_variable": {"type": "string", "description": "The dependent variable to predict in the regression model."}}, "required": ["dataset_path", "independent_variables", "dependent_variable"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\n[linear_regression.get_r_squared1(dataset_path='C:/data/cars.csv', independent_variables=['engine_size', 'fuel_economy'], dependent_variable='car_price)]", "possible_answer": [{"linear_regression.get_r_squared1": {"dataset_path": ["C:/data/cars.csv"], "independent_variables": [["engine_size", "fuel_economy"]], "dependent_variable": ["car_price"]}}, {"linear_regression.get_r_squared2": {"dataset_path": ["C:/data/cars.csv"], "independent_variables": [["engine_size", "fuel_economy"]], "dependent_variable": ["car_price"]}}, {"linear_regression.get_r_squared3": {"dataset_path": ["C:/data/cars.csv"], "independent_variables": [["engine_size", "fuel_economy"]], "dependent_variable": ["car_price"]}}]}

This method provides a straightforward way to invoke operating system commands directly from a Python script. The function can handle both individual commands and sequences of commands that are concatenated using the '&&' operator. The '&&' operator is a standard feature in command-line interfaces that allows the execution of multiple commands in sequence, where each subsequent command is only executed if the previous command is successful (i.e., returns a zero exit status).

The primary role of this function is to facilitate the execution of commands that one would typically run in the Windows command prompt or terminal, directly from within a Python script. It leverages the capabilities of `os.system()`, which is a wrapper for the standard C library function `system()`. \n\nBy employing this function, users can execute individual commands or a series of commands, which can be linked together using the '&&' operator.

This function provides the capability to run commands directly in the Windows command shell (cmd.exe), thereby allowing interaction with the operating system's command-line interface from within a Python script.\n\nWhen utilizing this function, users can execute a single command to perform a specific task. For example, a simple command like \"dir\" can be executed to list the directory contents.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.This function is designed to execute system-level commands specifically on Windows operating systems. By leveraging the `os.system()` function from Python's `os` module, it allows the execution of a command string as if it were typed directly into the command prompt. This functionality is highly useful for automating command-line tasks or integrating system commands into Python scripts.\n\nThe function can handle not only individual commands but also multiple commands that are chained together using the '&&' operator. This chaining mechanism is particularly advantageous when you need to execute multiple commands in sequence and want subsequent commands to run only if the preceding ones succeed. For example, if you want to change the directory and then list its contents, you could pass a command string like `cd my_directory && dir` to the function. This ensures that the `dir` command will only execute if the `cd my_directory` command is successful.\n\nAn important detail to note is that because this function utilizes the `os.system()` method, it is synchronous, meaning the Python script will wait for the command to complete before moving on to execute the next line of code. Therefore, it is advisable to be cautious with commands that might take a long time to execute, as they will block further script execution until they are completed.\n\nWhen using this function, it is essential to ensure that the command string is properly formatted and valid within the Windows command-line environment. Incorrect commands or improper syntax could lead to errors or unintended behavior. Additionally, since this function executes commands at the system level, it requires appropriate user permissions to succeed, especially for commands that modify system settings or require elevated privileges.\n\nIn summary, this function serves as a versatile tool for executing Windows command-line instructions from within a Python script, providing flexibility to run single commands or multiple commands in a controlled sequence using '&&'.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

This ensures that each command is executed in order, and the subsequent command will only run if the preceding command is successful. \n\nHowever, if your task involves executing more complex sequences of commands or requires specific environment setup, it is advisable to create a batch (.bat) file. This batch file can then be executed, allowing you to manage and execute a series of commands with greater flexibility and control. The batch file can include various command line instructions, setup commands, and other scripting logic, which might be cumbersome to manage directly through `os.system()`. \n\nIn summary, use `os.system()` for straightforward command execution, but for more intricate tasks, especially those involving multiple steps or requiring conditional logic, consider utilizing a batch file to encapsulate and execute your commands.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The Windows command line instruction(s) to be executed.

The text must be a valid string encoded in a format that supports natural language processing (e.g., UTF-8). \n\n#### Usage Example:\nTo use this function, you might pass a sentence like \"I love this product! It's amazing!\" to determine if the sentiment is positive. Another example could be analyzing a customer review or social media comment to understand the overall tone of user feedback.\n\n```python\n# Example of using the sentiment analysis function\ntext = \"I had a horrible experience with the service.\"\nsentiment = perform_sentiment_analysis(text)\nprint(sentiment)  # Expected output might classify this as 'negative'\n```\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- **Empty String:** If the input text is an empty string, the function should handle this gracefully, potentially returning a neutral sentiment or indicating that no sentiment can be detected due to lack of content.\n- **Ambiguous Language:** Text containing ambiguous or sarcastic language may pose challenges for sentiment analysis, potentially leading to less accurate classification.\n- **Non-Text Input:** The function should be robust against non-string input types, raising appropriate errors or warnings if the input does not conform to expected text data types.\n\nBy leveraging this function, you can gain insights into the emotional content of text data, which can be particularly useful for applications such as customer feedback analysis, brand monitoring, or social media", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"text": {"type": "string", "description": "The text on which to perform sentiment analysis."}, "language": {"type": "string", "description": "The language in which the text is written."}}, "required": ["text", "language"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\n[sentiment_analysis1(text='I love the food here!

This is particularly useful for users who are fans of a specific director's work and wish to explore more titles under their creative vision.\n\n2. **Genre**: The function also allows the user to input a desired genre to narrow down the search results. By specifying a genre, the function focuses on returning only those movies that fall under the user-specified category. This can include a wide range of genres such as action, comedy, drama, horror, or any other predefined genre classification within the system.\n\n3. **Cast**: Users can further refine their search by naming specific actors or actresses they are interested in. By including cast members in the search criteria, the function filters the movie list to include only those films where the specified individuals have played roles, whether leading or supporting.\n\nThe combination of these three parameters enables users to perform a highly targeted search, retrieving a list of movies that align closely with their specific viewing preferences. This functionality is particularly valuable for users who are seeking films that meet all three criteria, ensuring that their movie selections are both relevant and of interest based on the director's style, the narrative genre, and the performances by chosen cast members.\n\nUsage Example:\n\nA user wishes to find a thriller directed by Alfred Hitchcock featuring the actor Cary Grant. By inputting \"Alfred Hitchcock\" as the director, \"thriller\" as the genre, and \"Cary Grant\" as part of the cast, the function would search and return a list of movies that match these criteria, such as \"North by Northwest\".", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": [], "properties": {"directed_by": {"type": "string", "description": "Director of the movie.

It takes a single argument, `query`, which represents the keywords that the user wants to use to find the desired song. These keywords could include the song title, artist name, album, or a combination of these elements.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- `query` (string): This is a required parameter that specifies the search criteria. The function expects a string input that may contain the name of the song, the artist, or any relevant keyword associated with the music track the user wishes to play. The more specific the query, the more accurate the search results will be.\n\n#### Functionality:\n1. **Search Mechanism:** The function initiates a search on the Spotify platform using the provided query. It sends a request to Spotify's search API to retrieve a list of songs that match the given criteria. The search is comprehensive and scans a wide database of music, covering various genres, artists, and albums.\n\n2. **Selection and Playback:** After retrieving the search results, the function selects the most relevant song based on the query. The criteria for selecting the best match could include exact title matches, the popularity of the song, or recency of release. Once the appropriate track is identified, the function sends a command to Spotify to play the song through the user's Spotify account.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- If the query is vague or too broad, the function may return multiple results, and the selection might not always be the user's intended choice.\n- In scenarios where no matches are found for the given query, the function should handle this gracefully, potentially by notifying the user of the issue or suggesting alternative queries.\n- The function assumes that the user is authenticated with Spotify and has an active session for playback to occur. If these conditions are not met, the function should handle authentication errors.\n\n#### Example Usage:\n```", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["query"], "properties": {"query": {"type": "string", "description": "The search query for the song.

The primary purpose of this function is to determine the difference in time zones between two places around the world, which could be important for scheduling meetings, coordinating travel plans, or simply understanding time-related aspects of different locations.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **location1**: The first parameter represents the first geographical location for which you want to know the time zone offset. This could be a city name, a country, or a specific coordinate (latitude and longitude). For instance, \"New York\" or \"40.7128\u00b0 N, 74.0060\u00b0 W\".\n\n- **location2**: The second parameter represents the second geographical location whose time zone offset will be compared against the first. This should be provided in a similar format as `location1`, such as \"Tokyo\" or \"35.6895\u00b0 N, 139.6917\u00b0 E\".\n\n#### Functionality:\n\nUpon receiving the input locations, the function identifies the respective time zones of each location. It then computes the difference in time between these two locations, taking into consideration factors such as the time of year, daylight saving changes, and any local time adjustments that might be in effect.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Daylight Saving Time (DST)**: The function takes into account any daylight saving adjustments that may be applicable to either of the locations during the specified period. This ensures accuracy across different times of the year when daylight saving policies might shift the local time by an hour.\n\n- **Non-standard Time Offsets**: Some regions have time zones that do not align with whole-hour differences (e.g., 30-minute or 45-minute offsets). This function correctly calculates these partial-hour differences as well.\n\n- **Destination Support**: If either location is a large city that spans multiple time zones (such as a country or large state), the function uses the most prominent", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"place1": {"type": "string", "description": "The first place for time difference."}, "place2": {"type": "string", "description": "The second place for time difference."}}, "required": ["place1", "place2"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\n[get_time_difference1(place1=\"San Francisco\", place2=\"Sydney)]", "possible_answer": [{"get_time_difference1": {"place1": ["San Francisco", "SF"], "place2": ["Sydney"]}}, {"get_time_difference2": {"place1": ["San Francisco", "SF"], "place2": ["Sydney"]}}, {"get_time_difference3": {"place1": ["San Francisco", "SF"], "place2": ["Sydney"]}}]}

Account for coverage efficiency of the paint and exclusions (like windows).The function is designed to determine the total amount of paint necessary to cover a specified area effectively. This calculation takes into account several critical factors to ensure accuracy. Firstly, the total area to be covered must be provided as an input parameter, typically measured in square units such as square feet or square meters, depending on the context.\n\nIn addition to the area itself, the function must also consider the paint's coverage efficiency, which is a measure of how much area a single unit of paint can cover. This efficiency is often provided by the paint manufacturer and is usually expressed in terms of square units per gallon or liter. By incorporating this efficiency factor, the function can accurately estimate the quantity of paint required, ensuring that there is neither a surplus nor a shortage.\n\nAnother important aspect of the calculation involves accounting for any exclusions within the area to be painted. These exclusions typically include features such as windows, doors, or any other elements that should not be painted. The function should allow input for the total area of these exclusions and subtract them from the overall area, thus refining the estimate to represent only the paintable surface.\n\nTo illustrate, consider the following usage example: if a room has a total wall area of 500 square feet, with windows and doors covering 50 square feet, and the paint covers 350 square feet per gallon, the function should first subtract the exclusion area (50 square feet) from the total area (500 square feet), resulting in 450 square feet of paintable surface. Then, it divides this by the coverage efficiency (350 square feet per gallon) to determine that approximately 1.29 gallons of paint are required. In practical terms, this would typically be rounded up to ensure complete coverage.\n\nIn summary, the function's purpose is to provide a precise estimate of the paint required by considering the total area, adjusting for paint coverage efficiency, and subtracting any areas that do not need painting.

The function aims to provide insights into where the team stands among its competitors by evaluating its achievements during the specified timeframe.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `season`: This parameter allows the user to specify the particular season for which they want to obtain the team rankings. This could be represented in various formats, such as a single year (e.g., 2023) or a range of years (e.g., 2022-2023) depending on how the sports league organizes its seasons. It is crucial for the user to input the correct season to ensure the accuracy of the ranking data retrieved.\n\n- `type`: The `type` parameter refers to the specific category or division within the league. Sports leagues often have multiple types such as regular season, playoffs, or different divisions/classes within the league. Selecting the appropriate type is essential for obtaining the correct and relevant ranking as it influences the context and scope of the standings.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\nSuppose a user wants to find out how their favorite basketball team ranked during the 2022 season in the regular season category. The user would call the function with `season` set as `2022` and `type` as `Regular Season`. The function would then process these inputs, access the historical data for the specified season and type, and return the team's ranking position among all competing teams.\n\n**Edge Cases and Considerations:**\n\n- It is important to ensure that the season and type inputs are valid and correspond to existing data within the league's records. If the inputs are incorrect or if there is no data available for the provided season or type, the function may return an error or a null value.\n  \n- The function assumes that the data is up-to-date and accurately reflects the", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"team_name": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the sports team."}, "league": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the league in which the team competes."}, "season": {"type": "string", "description": "The season for which the team's ranking is sought."}, "type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of the season: regular or playoff.", "enum": ["regular", "playoff"]}}, "required": ["team_name", "league", "season", "type"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\n[get_team_rank1(team_name=\"LA Lakers\", league=\"NBA\", season=\"2021\", type=\"regular)]", "possible_answer": [{"get_team_rank1": {"team_name": ["LA Lakers"], "league": ["NBA"], "season": ["2021"], "type": ["regular"]}}, {"get_team_rank2": {"team_name": ["LA Lakers"], "league": ["NBA"], "season": ["2021"], "type": ["regular"]}}, {"get_team_rank3": {"team_name": ["LA Lakers"], "league": ["NBA"], "season": ["2021"], "type": ["regular"]}}]}

It then divides this by the total number of possible 5-card hands that can be dealt from the deck. With a 52-card deck, the total number of possible hands is calculated as \"52 choose 5\", which represents the number of combinations of 52 cards taken 5 at a time.\n\nThe function's output is a probability value, usually expressed as a decimal or a percentage, indicating the likelihood of being dealt a full house in a single hand of poker. It's important to note that this function assumes a fair and random distribution of cards. Additionally, it presumes no prior knowledge of other players' cards or any cards that may have been discarded, thus providing an unbiased statistical probability.\n\nExample usage of this function might involve invoking it without any additional parameters, as the calculation only depends on the fixed properties of a standard deck of cards. The result can be useful for players seeking to understand their odds in a game or for those involved in developing poker-related software or simulations. It's also important to highlight that the function does not account for strategic elements of gameplay, such as bluffing or betting strategies, as it solely focuses on the mathematical aspect of card distribution.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"deck_size": {"type": "integer", "description": "The size of the deck.

The function then performs the necessary calculations to accurately transform the input value into the specified output unit, taking into account the conversion factors between different measurement systems, such as the US customary system and the metric system.\n\nEdge cases include ensuring that values are non-negative since negative measurements do not make sense in a cooking context, and handling units that may not have a direct conversion factor. For instance, converting between dry and liquid ingredients might require a different approach due to differences in density and volume.\n\nAn example of how this function might be used is converting 2 cups of flour to its equivalent in grams. The user would input \"2 cups\" as the original value and unit, and specify \"grams\" as the desired unit. The function would then calculate the equivalent weight in grams, taking into account the specific density of flour.\n\nThis functionality is particularly useful for chefs, home cooks, and culinary professionals who frequently encounter recipes written in different units. By standardizing measurements, the function helps maintain consistency in cooking results and ensures that ingredient proportions remain correct, regardless of the measurement units originally provided in a recipe.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"value": {"type": "integer", "description": "The value to be converted."}, "from_unit": {"type": "string", "description": "The unit to convert from.

Additionally, if no parking lots are found within the specified radius, the function should handle this scenario gracefully, potentially returning a message indicating that no options are available and suggesting an increase in the search radius.\n\nUsage example:\n- Input: Location coordinates (latitude: 40.7128, longitude: -74.0060), radius: 5 kilometers\n- Output: Details of the nearest parking lot, such as its address, distance from the location, and capacity, if available.\n\nThe function is useful for applications requiring real-time parking assistance, such as navigation apps, urban planning tools, or visitor guides, helping users quickly find convenient parking options near their destination.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"location": {"type": "string", "description": "The reference location e.g. Central Park, NY"}, "radius": {"type": "integer", "description": "The maximum distance from the location in miles.

Options to include specific departments are available.The `LocateNearbyHospitals` function is designed to help users find hospitals within a specified geographical area. This function takes into account the user's current location and a defined search radius to identify hospitals that fall within these parameters. Users can specify their location using coordinates such as latitude and longitude, or alternatively, they can provide a city or zip code for a more general search.\n\nThe radius parameter is essential as it determines the extent of the search area from the specified location. The radius can be adjusted to cover smaller or larger areas depending on the user's needs, measured typically in miles or kilometers.\n\nAn additional feature of this function is its ability to filter search results based on specific hospital departments. Users can choose to include only those hospitals that have certain medical departments or facilities. This is particularly useful for individuals seeking specialized medical care, such as cardiology, oncology, pediatrics, or emergency services. The function provides options to specify one or multiple departments to refine search results further.\n\nFor instance, a user searching for hospitals within a 10-mile radius of their home who specifically needs a hospital with an emergency department can use this function to generate a list that meets these criteria.
