It performs an essential task by ensuring that the name of the food item, as provided in the customer's request, is altered to comply with a particular format requirement \u2014 being in uppercase letters. This functionality is crucial for maintaining uniformity and meeting system standards that dictate the use of uppercase for all food item entries.\n\n#### Functionality Details:\n- **Input:** The function takes in a food item name as part of the customer's order or request. It is expected that this name is provided as a string.\n- **Processing:** Upon receiving the input, the function processes the string to check and convert the food name to uppercase. This step ensures that regardless of how the food name is initially input (whether in lowercase, mixed case, etc.), it will be stored or returned in an uppercase format.\n- **Output:** The function outputs the modified food name, ensuring it is in uppercase, thus guaranteeing consistency across all food selections within the system.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- If the input food name is already in uppercase, the function will recognize this and maintain the current format without unnecessary modifications.\n- The function should handle cases where the input might be an empty string by appropriately managing such instances to prevent errors or unexpected behavior.\n- Non-string inputs should be checked and managed, either by converting them to strings if possible or raising an error to notify that the input is invalid.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nSuppose a customer requests \"pasta\" as their food choice. When this function is applied, the output will be \"PASTA,\" ensuring that the system records the food selection in the required uppercase format.\n\n```python\nchange_food_selection(\"pasta\")  # Output: \"PASTA\"\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates the function's role in transforming the input string to meet the uppercase requirement, highlighting how it achieves both data consistency and system compliance.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["TheFod"], "properties": {"TheFod": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the food to be changed, provided in uppercase letters only (e.g., 'PIZZA', 'BURGER').", "enum": ["PIZZA", "BURGER", "SALAD", "SOUP", "STEAK"]}}}}, {"name": "ChaFod2", "description": "Changes the selection of food based on the customer's request, ensuring the food name provided is in uppercase as per the requirement.

Entropy, a measure of disorder or randomness in a system, is a fundamental concept in thermodynamics, particularly in understanding energy distribution and efficiency.\n\n### Parameters\n\n- **initial_temperature (T)**: This parameter represents the constant temperature at which the process occurs. It is crucial that this temperature remains constant throughout the process to ensure it is isothermal. The temperature is generally expressed in Kelvin (K) to maintain consistency with thermodynamic calculations.\n\n- **heat_transfer (Q)**: The heat transferred into or out of the system during the process. For a reversible process, this transfer must occur in such a way that the system remains in equilibrium with its surroundings at every stage. The heat transfer is typically measured in joules (J).\n\n### Calculation Details\n\nThe entropy change for an isothermal and reversible process is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta S = \\frac{Q}{T}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\Delta S \\) is the change in entropy.\n- \\( Q \\) is the heat transferred.\n- \\( T \\) is the constant absolute temperature at which the process occurs.\n\n### Edge Cases and Considerations\n\n- **Zero Heat Transfer**: If the heat transfer (\\( Q \\)) is zero, the change in entropy (\\( \\Delta S \\)) will also be zero. This occurs when no energy enters or leaves the system as heat, which could be a hypothetical scenario in a perfectly isolated system.\n\n- **Negative Heat Transfer**: In cases where heat is removed from the system (\\( Q \\) is negative), the entropy change will also be negative, indicating a decrease in the system's disorder as it loses energy.\n\n- **Temperature Constraints**: The function assumes that the input temperature (\\( T \\)) is", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"initial_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial temperature in Kelvin."}, "final_temp": {"type": "integer", "description": "The final temperature in Kelvin."}, "heat_capacity": {"type": "integer", "description": "The heat capacity in J/K."}, "isothermal": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether the process is isothermal.

This calculation is crucial in the field of astronomy and astrophysics, as it helps scientists and researchers determine how long it takes for light to travel across the vast expanses of space separating different celestial objects, such as stars, planets, and galaxies.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n- **distance (float)**: The distance between the two celestial bodies, typically measured in astronomical units (AU), light-years, kilometers, or other relevant units of measure. It's essential that the unit of distance is consistent with the speed of light unit to ensure accurate calculations.\n\n- **speed_of_light (float, optional)**: The speed at which light travels, generally accepted as approximately 299,792 kilometers per second in a vacuum. This parameter should be adjustable, allowing users to input different values if they are considering scenarios in media other than a vacuum, where the speed of light might differ.\n\n#### Returns\n\n- **time (float)**: The time taken for light to travel from the source celestial body to the destination celestial body, presented in a standard time unit such as seconds, minutes, or hours, depending on the context of the calculation and the user's requirements.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n\n- **Zero Distance**: If the distance input is zero, the time taken for light to travel should be zero, as no travel occurs.\n\n- **Negative Distance**: A negative distance is physically meaningless in this context and should raise an exception or error, prompting the user to input a valid positive distance value.\n\n- **Extremely Large Distances**: For astronomical distances, ensure the calculation doesn't result in overflow errors by using data types that can handle large numbers, such as double or long double in languages that support them.\n\n#### Example Usage\n\n```python\n# Example call to the function\nlight_travel_time = calculate_light_travel_time(distance=4.367", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"distance_in_light_years": {"type": "integer", "description": "The distance between the two celestial bodies in light years."}, "speed_of_light": {"type": "integer", "description": "The speed of light in vacuum, in m/s.

It takes two primary inputs: the purchase amount, which is the original cost of goods or services before tax, and the jurisdiction, which determines the applicable tax rate. The jurisdiction can be a state, county, or city, depending on the level of detail required for tax calculation. The function internally retrieves the correct sales tax rate for the given jurisdiction, ensuring that the calculation aligns with local tax laws and regulations.\n\nOnce the correct tax rate is applied to the purchase amount, the function calculates the sales tax by multiplying the purchase amount by the jurisdiction's tax rate.

An edge case to consider is when a query does not clearly fit into any predefined category; the function should have a mechanism to handle such scenarios, either by logging it under a 'miscellaneous' category or flagging it for manual review. For example, if a user inputs a query related to \"account settings,\" the function would classify this under a category such as \"User Account Management,\" provided such a category exists among the predefined options.

For strings, it returns the characters in reverse order. For booleans, it returns the negation. For numbers, it returns the negative value.This function is designed to reverse the given input by transforming it into an opposite or inverted form based on its data type. It handles different types of inputs, including strings, booleans, and numbers, each with their specific rules for reversal:\n\n- **Strings**: When the input is a string, this function processes it by reversing the order of its characters. For example, if the input string is \"hello\", the function will return \"olleh\". This reversal is achieved by iterating over the string from the end to the beginning, constructing a new string that starts with the last character of the input and ends with the first.\n\n- **Booleans**: In the case of a boolean input, the function returns its logical negation. Specifically, if the input is `true`, the function returns `false`, and if the input is `false`, the function returns `true`. This is accomplished using the logical NOT operation, which toggles the boolean state.\n\n- **Numbers**: For numerical inputs, the function returns the negative of the given number. For example, if the input is `5`, the function returns `-5`, and if the input is `-3`, it returns `3`. This inversion is performed by multiplying the number by `-1`, effectively changing its sign.\n\nEdge cases and considerations include ensuring that the input is of a recognized type (string, boolean, or number) before attempting to reverse it. If the input is of an unsupported type, the function may need to handle this scenario, potentially by throwing an error or returning a specific value indicating the unsupported type. Additionally, for integer inputs that are `0`, the function will return `0`, as the negative of zero is still zero.

Specifically, it takes into account the area of the house, measured typically in square feet or square meters, which is a crucial determinant of property value as larger homes generally command higher prices. Additionally, the function considers the number of rooms, an important factor as it relates to the house's capacity to accommodate inhabitants, which can significantly affect the price. More rooms often imply greater potential for family living or rental opportunities, thus potentially increasing the house's market value.\n\nMoreover, the function incorporates the year of construction, a detail that can denote the age and condition of the house.

It is typically expressed as a monetary value, such as dollars, and serves as the starting point for the future value calculation.\n\n2. **Expected Annual Return**: This parameter represents the rate at which the investment is anticipated to grow annually.

It is crucial to note that this is an expected value, meaning it is based on predictions and historical data but is not guaranteed.\n\n3. **Number of Years**: This is the duration for which the investment will be held, measured in years. It determines the time period over which the compound growth will occur. The longer the duration, the greater the potential for the investment to increase in value, assuming a positive annual return rate.\n\nThe function utilizes the formula for compound interest to compute the future value of the investment.

It takes into account several critical inputs to ensure the contract is suited to the needs of the involved parties. The function requires the user to specify the parties involved in the contract, the type of contract being generated, and the location where the contract will be applied. These inputs are crucial as they directly influence the legal language, clauses, and applicability of the contract.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **Involved Parties**: \n   - This parameter should include detailed information about all parties engaged in the contract. This includes names, roles, and possibly other identifying details necessary to clearly distinguish each party within the legal framework of the contract.\n   - Edge Case: If the number of parties exceeds standard limits or formats, the function should provide an error message or request for further specification.\n\n2. **Contract Type**: \n   - The type of contract is a fundamental input, as it determines the structure and content of the agreement. This could range from employment contracts, service agreements, non-disclosure agreements, to lease contracts, among others.\n   - Edge Case: If the contract type is unrecognized or unsupported, the function should prompt the user to confirm or provide additional information.\n\n3. **Location**: \n   - The location parameter is essential since legal requirements and enforceability can vary significantly between jurisdictions.

These factors include the total distance the vehicle travels over the course of a year, the type of fuel that it uses, and its fuel efficiency rating.\n\n### Parameters:\n\n1. **Distance Traveled**: This parameter represents the total mileage or distance that the vehicle covers within a year. It is typically measured in miles or kilometers. The greater the distance traveled, the higher the likelihood of increased emissions, assuming all other factors are constant.\n\n2. **Fuel Type**: The type of fuel used by the vehicle is a crucial determinant of its CO2 emissions. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, and alternative fuels such as electric or hybrid options. Each fuel type has a different carbon content and emission factor, affecting the overall emissions calculation.\n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency**: Fuel efficiency is usually measured in terms of miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km). It indicates how effectively a vehicle uses fuel. Vehicles with higher fuel efficiency consume less fuel over the same distance, leading to lower carbon emissions.\n\n### Calculation Considerations:\n\n- **Emission Factors**: The function utilizes predefined emission factors that correspond to each fuel type. These factors represent the average CO2 emissions produced per unit of fuel consumed and are essential for accurate calculation.\n\n- **Conversion Metrics**: The function may require conversion between different measurement units, such as converting kilometers to miles or liters to gallons, depending on the input format.\n\n- **Annual Basis**: The calculation is specifically aimed at determining emissions on an annual basis. It assumes that the provided distance traveled is reflective of the vehicle's yearly usage.\n\n### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose a vehicle travels 15,000 kilometers annually, runs on gasoline, and has a fuel efficiency of 8 liters per 100 kilometers.

The third scale degree in this key is B, leading to the B-D#-F# chord.\n\nIt's important to note that the function assumes the use of standard tuning and equal temperament, which is the common tuning system in Western music. The calculation does not take into account variations such as different temperaments or tunings. This function is particularly useful for musicians and composers who need to quickly identify chords within a key, as well as for educational purposes in teaching music theory concepts related to chord construction and scale degrees.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"key": {"type": "string", "description": "The key of the scale."}, "type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of the scale, either major or minor.
