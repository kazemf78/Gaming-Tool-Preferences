These charges are usually measured in coulombs (C). Additionally, the function needs the distance \\( r \\), measured in meters (m), between the centers of the two charged bodies. This distance should be a positive value, as a zero or negative distance is physically meaningless in this context and would lead to invalid calculations.\n\nThe function may also consider the medium in which the charged bodies are situated. In many cases, this is the vacuum, but if the bodies are in a medium other than a vacuum, the function should account for the relative permittivity (also known as the dielectric constant) of that medium. The permittivity of free space, denoted as \\( \\varepsilon_0 \\), is a known constant and is typically used in these calculations unless otherwise specified.\n\nMathematically, the electrostatic potential \\( V \\) between two charges can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{k \\cdot q_1 \\cdot q_2}{r} \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is Coulomb's constant, approximately equal to \\( 8.9875 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{N m}^2/\\text{C}^2 \\). This constant incorporates the permittivity of free space and is crucial for accurate calculations.\n\nUsage Example:\nConsider two point charges", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"charge1": {"type": "float", "description": "The quantity of charge on the first body."}, "charge2": {"type": "float", "description": "The quantity of charge on the second body."}, "distance": {"type": "float", "description": "The distance between the two bodies."}, "constant": {"type": "float", "description": "The value of the electrostatic constant.

This calculation is crucial in thermodynamics to understand how energy is dispersed in such a process without any loss due to irreversibility. \n\nIn an isothermal and reversible process, the change in entropy (\u0394S) is determined using the formula \u0394S = Q/T, where Q represents the heat exchanged during the process and T is the absolute temperature at which the process occurs, expressed in Kelvin.

This limitation is particularly useful when precise control is required over the appliance's operations, as it prevents any potential conflicts that could arise from sending multiple commands simultaneously.\n\n### Usage Example\n\nSuppose you are working with a smart home system where you need to adjust the temperature setting on a smart thermostat. Using this function, you can send a specific temperature value, such as 72 degrees Fahrenheit, to the thermostat. The function call would look something like this:\n\n```python\nsend_command_to_appliance(72)\n```\n\nIn this example, `72` represents the single value being sent to control the appliance.\n\n### Parameter Explanation\n\n- **value (int/float/string)**: The command value to be sent to the appliance. This parameter represents the exact instruction the appliance will receive. Depending on the appliance's capabilities, this value could be an integer, a floating-point number, or even a specific string command understood by the appliance.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- **Invalid Values**: If the value sent is not recognized by the appliance, it may result in an error or the appliance may ignore the command altogether. It is crucial to ensure that the value conforms to the expected input range or format for the appliance being controlled.\n- **Network Issues**: In scenarios where the command relies on network communication, issues such as connectivity problems or latency might affect the successful transmission of the command. It is advisable to include error-checking mechanisms to confirm the command was successfully received and executed by the appliance.\n\nOverall, the function provides a streamlined method for issuing a single, distinct command to an appliance, making it an essential tool for tasks that require direct and specific control.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["body"], "properties": {"body": {"type": "dict", "description": "A dictionary containing the parameters for the appliance command.", "properties": {"airConJobMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The current job mode of the air conditioner.", "enum": ["AIR_CLEAN", "COOL", "AIR_DRY"], "default": "COOL"}, "windStrength": {"type": "string", "description": "The strength of the air flow.", "enum": ["LOW", "HIGH", "MID"], "default": "MID"}, "monitoringEnabled": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether air quality sensor monitoring is enabled.", "default": false}, "airCleanOperationMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The operation mode for the air cleaning function.", "enum": ["START", "STOP"], "default": "STOP"}, "airConOperationMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The operation mode for the air conditioner, indicating if it is turned on or off.", "enum": ["POWER_ON", "POWER_OFF"], "default": "POWER_OFF"}, "powerSaveEnabled": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether power save mode is enabled to conserve energy.", "default": false}, "targetTemperature": {"type": "integer", "description": "The target temperature to set for the appliance, in degrees Celsius.", "default": 20}, "relativeHourToStop": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of hours from the current time when the appliance should stop.

Allows for the bulk recording of query classifications in one function call.This function is designed to facilitate the process of recording classifications for a collection of queries by utilizing intent names that are specified through keyword arguments. It serves as a mechanism to efficiently handle multiple query classifications in a single execution, thereby streamlining the workflow for users who need to manage large datasets or multiple queries simultaneously.\n\nThe primary purpose of this function is to map each query to its corresponding intent classification based on the intent names that are passed as keyword arguments. By allowing keyword arguments, users have the flexibility to specify intent names that accurately describe the purpose or category of each query. This feature enables precise classification and organization of data, which is particularly useful in applications such as natural language processing, user interaction analysis, and automated response systems.\n\nIn practical usage, the function accepts several keyword arguments where each key corresponds to a query, and its value represents the intent name. For example, if you have a series of queries related to customer support interactions, you might use the function to assign intents like \"billing_inquiry\", \"technical_support\", or \"general_feedback\" to each query, thereby tagging them for further processing or analysis.\n\nAn edge case to consider when using this function is ensuring that the intent names provided in the keyword arguments are valid and recognized by the system. Invalid or misspelled intent names may result in misclassification or errors. Additionally, the user should handle scenarios where no intent is provided for a query, as this might require default handling or error reporting within the function.\n\nOverall, this function is a powerful tool for users who need to efficiently manage and record classifications across a wide range of queries. By allowing for bulk operations, it reduces the overhead and potential for error compared to recording each classification individually. It is important for users to familiarize themselves with the expected format and constraints of the keyword arguments to make the most of this function's capabilities.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["acc_routing_start", "atm_finder_start", "faq_link_accounts_start", "get_balance_start", "get_transactions_start", "outofscope"], "properties": {"acc_routing_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries requesting the bank routing numbers or account numbers."}, "atm_finder_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for locations of ATMs, specified in the format of 'City, State (abbr)', such as 'Berkeley, CA' or 'New York, NY'."}, "faq_link_accounts_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to linking accounts within the bank's system."}, "get_balance_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for account balances, available funds, or other financial balances."}, "get_transactions_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to viewing transactions, deposits, purchases, and transaction details."}, "outofscope": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries that do not classify to any other available intents."}}}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"record2": {"outofscope": ["what is the weather like"]}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"record2": {"outofscope": ["what is the weather like"]}}], "possible_answer": [{"record1": {"acc_routing_start": [], "atm_finder_start": [], "faq_link_accounts_start": [], "get_balance_start": [], "get_transactions_start": [], "outofscope": [["what is the weather like"]]}}, {"record2": {"acc_routing_start": [], "atm_finder_start": [], "faq_link_accounts_start": [], "get_balance_start": [], "get_transactions_start": [], "outofscope": [["what is the weather like"]]}}, {"record3": {"acc_routing_start": [], "atm_finder_start": [], "faq_link_accounts_start": [], "get_balance_start": [], "get_transactions_start": [], "outofscope": [["what is the weather like"]]}}]}

The calculation is based on three primary factors: the distance the vehicle travels in a year, the type of fuel used by the vehicle, and its fuel efficiency.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n1. **Distance Traveled (annual_distance):** This represents the total distance covered by the vehicle over the course of a year. It is usually measured in miles or kilometers, depending on the preferred unit system. Accurate input of this parameter is crucial as it directly influences the resulting emissions calculation.\n\n2. **Fuel Type (fuel_type):** This denotes the type of fuel the vehicle uses. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, natural gas, and electricity. Different fuels emit varying amounts of CO2 when consumed, and this parameter allows the function to use the appropriate emission factor for the calculation. \n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency (fuel_efficiency):** This is a measure of how effectively a vehicle uses fuel, typically expressed in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). Higher fuel efficiency indicates that the vehicle can travel more distance using less fuel, thus producing fewer emissions for the same distance traveled.\n\n**Calculation Process:**\n\nThe core calculation involves determining the total fuel consumption for the given distance based on the vehicle's fuel efficiency.

To achieve this, the function requires three key parameters: the airline, the passenger's name, and the ticket number. Here's a more detailed explanation of these parameters and the function's operation:\n\n- **Airline**: This parameter should be the official name or the designated airline code (such as 'AA' for American Airlines) representing the carrier operating the flight. It serves as a critical identifier, distinguishing the specific airline among various operators in the aviation industry. Accurate input is essential for retrieving the correct flight information.\n\n- **Passenger's Name**: This parameter refers to the full name of the traveler as it appears on the airline's reservation system. It acts as a secondary verification measure, ensuring that the flight status information corresponds to the correct individual and preventing any mismatches in data retrieval.\n\n- **Ticket Number**: The ticket number is a unique identifier associated with the passenger's booking. It serves as a precise reference point for the airline's database to locate the exact reservation details. The ticket number is typically a numeric string and is crucial for pinpointing the flight among numerous records.\n\nThe function, upon receiving these inputs, interacts with the airline's database or system to fetch the most recent details about the flight linked to the passenger. The current status of the flight may include information such as on-time status, delay notifications, gate information, boarding schedules, or any changes to the original itinerary. Timely and accurate data retrieval is dependent on the precision and correctness of the provided parameters.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\n```python\nflight_status = CheckFlightStatus('AA', 'John Doe', '1234567890')\n# This call checks the current status of a flight booked with American Airlines for the passenger John Doe with the ticket number 1234567890.\n```\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n1. **Incorrect Details**: Providing an incorrect airline code, misspelling the passenger's", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["airlines", "person_name", "ticket_number"], "properties": {"airlines": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the airline for which to check the flight status, such as 'Delta' or 'United'."}, "person_name": {"type": "string", "description": "The full name or first name of the passenger as it appears on the ticket, in the format 'First Last'.
