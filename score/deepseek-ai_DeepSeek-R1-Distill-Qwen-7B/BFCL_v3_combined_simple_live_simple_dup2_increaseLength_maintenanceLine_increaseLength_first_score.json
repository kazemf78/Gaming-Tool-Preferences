The derivative represents the rate at which the function's value changes as its input changes, and it is a fundamental concept in calculus.\n\nWhen calculating the derivative of a polynomial function, the rule applied involves taking each term of the polynomial, multiplying the coefficient of the term by the exponent of the variable, and then decreasing the exponent by one. For instance, if the polynomial is represented as \\(a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\ldots + a_1x + a_0\\), the derivative would be computed as follows: \\(n \\times a_nx^{n-1} + (n-1) \\times a_{n-1}x^{n-2} + \\ldots + 1 \\times a_1x^0\\).

It is important to handle edge cases, such as when the polynomial is constant, meaning it has a degree of zero, resulting in a derivative of zero.\n\nFor example, if the input polynomial is \\(3x^3 + 2x^2 + x + 5\\), the function will output the derivative \\(9x^2 + 4x + 1\\).

The function requires two parameters: the acceleration of the object and the distance it has traveled. \n\nThe final velocity can be determined using the kinematic equation that relates acceleration, distance, and velocity, assuming no initial velocity. The equation used is:\n\n\\[ v^2 = u^2 + 2as \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( v \\) represents the final velocity,\n- \\( u \\) is the initial velocity (which is 0 in this case),\n- \\( a \\) is the constant acceleration,\n- \\( s \\) stands for the distance traveled.\n\nSince the initial velocity \\( u \\) is zero, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ v^2 = 2as \\]\n\nFrom this, the final velocity \\( v \\) can be calculated by rearranging the equation to solve for \\( v \\):\n\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{2as} \\]\n\nThis function assumes that the acceleration remains constant throughout the distance traveled. It also assumes that the motion is in a straight line and occurs under ideal conditions, with no external forces like friction or air resistance affecting the motion.\n\n### Usage Example\n\nTo use this function, provide the acceleration and distance as inputs. For instance, if an object is subjected to an acceleration of 3 meters per second squared (m/s^2) and travels a distance of 50 meters, the function will compute the final velocity as follows:\n\n```python\nacceleration = 3  # m/s^2\ndistance = 50     # meters\nfinal_velocity = calculate_final_velocity(acceleration, distance)\n```\n\nIn this example, the value returned by the function would represent the final velocity of the object after traveling 50 meters under the given acceleration conditions. \n\n### Edge Cases\n\nIt is important to consider edge cases where either the acceleration or the distance might be zero:\n- **Zero acceleration**", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"acceleration": {"type": "integer", "description": "Acceleration of the object, m/s^2."}, "distance": {"type": "integer", "description": "Distance traveled by the object, m."}, "initial_velocity": {"type": "float", "description": "Initial velocity of the object.

This scenario simplifies the problem by eliminating drag forces, allowing us to focus solely on the effects of gravity. The calculation typically involves using the fundamental principles of classical mechanics, specifically the laws of motion and energy conservation.\n\nTo determine the final speed, the function employs the gravitational acceleration constant, typically denoted as \\( g \\), which has an approximate value of 9.81 meters per second squared (m/s\u00b2) on the surface of the Earth. The formula used in this calculation is derived from the conservation of energy, where the initial potential energy at the given height is converted into kinetic energy as the object falls.\n\nThe final speed (\\( v_f \\)) can be computed using the equation:\n\n\\[ v_f = \\sqrt{2gh} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( v_f \\) is the final speed of the object in meters per second (m/s),\n- \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity, approximately 9.81 m/s\u00b2,\n- \\( h \\) is the height from which the object is dropped, measured in meters (m).\n\nEdge Cases and Considerations:\n- If the height (\\( h \\)) is zero, the object does not fall, and the final speed will consequently be zero.\n- Negative values for height do not physically make sense in this context and should be handled as invalid input.\n- The function assumes the initial velocity of the object at the height is zero since it is dropped from rest.\n\nExample Usage:\nImagine you want to calculate the speed of a rock just before it hits the ground when dropped from a 10-meter-high cliff.

The logistic function, or sigmoid function, is key as it allows interpreting the output as a probability. The model estimates the probability that an observation belongs to a particular class based on input features. Unlike linear regression, which predicts a continuous outcome, logistic regression is suitable for classification tasks. The hypothesis function, h\u03b8(x) = g(\u03b8^T x), uses the sigmoid function g to map the linear combination of features to a probability. The cost function used is log loss, and regularization techniques like L1 or L2 can prevent overfitting. The decision boundary is non-linear due to the sigmoid function, enabling handling of non-linearly separable data.

The function may utilize factors such as average speed limits, expected traffic conditions, and the time spent at each optional stop to deliver a more accurate and realistic travel time estimate. \n\n### Edge Cases:\n- **No Stops:** In scenarios where no optional stops are included, the function will compute the travel time solely based on the direct path between the starting point and the destination.\n- **High Number of Stops:** If an excessive number of stops are added, the function may assume a longer cumulative travel time, reflecting the increased time spent stopping and starting.\n- **Variable Traffic Conditions:** The function's accuracy may vary depending on the predictability of traffic conditions; peak traffic hours might not be fully accounted for without additional real-time data inputs.\n\n### Usage Example:\nWhen using the function, a user might input a route from City A to City B, with optional stops at Restaurant C and Park D.

Optical density is a measure of how much a sample can scatter or absorb light, which is directly related to the number of cells present in the sample. The experiment dilution refers to the process by which the sample was diluted to reach the concentration used in the measurement.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- **Optical Density (OD):** This parameter should be a numerical value, typically measured at a specific wavelength, such as 600 nm (OD600), in a spectrophotometer. It reflects the turbidity of the culture, which correlates with the number of cells in the sample. The OD value must be positive and is commonly within a range that ensures accurate readings, generally between 0.1 and 1.0 for linearity.\n\n- **Dilution Factor:** This parameter indicates the ratio of the initial volume of the concentrated sample to the total volume of the diluted sample. It is usually expressed as a simple fraction or a multiple (e.g., 1:10 or 10). The dilution factor must be greater than 0 and represents how much the sample has been diluted relative to its original concentration.\n\n**Calculation Overview:**\n\nThe cell density is computed by adjusting the optical density based on the dilution factor. The formula typically used is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cell Density} = \\text{OD} \\times \\text{Dilution Factor} \\]\n\nThis formula assumes a direct proportionality between optical density and cell concentration, which holds true under the linear range of the spectrophotometer.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\nSuppose you have a biological sample with an optical density of 0.6 measured at 600 nm, and it was diluted at a 1:5 ratio (one part sample to four parts diluent, making a total of five parts).

It is particularly useful for applications that require climate analysis, weather forecasting, or environmental monitoring. The function takes into account various data points collected over the selected timeframe to calculate an accurate average temperature, ensuring that the user receives a reliable result.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **Location**: This parameter specifies the geographical area for which the average temperature needs to be calculated. It can be defined in terms of city names, coordinates, or predefined location IDs, depending on the system's requirements. The location parameter is crucial as it determines the area from which temperature data will be aggregated.\n\n2. **Timeframe**: This parameter defines the duration over which the average temperature is calculated. It can be expressed in various forms, such as a specific start and end date, a range of years, months, or days, or in relative terms like the past week or month. The timeframe is vital as it influences the number of data points considered in the calculation, which directly impacts the accuracy of the average temperature.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose a user wants to know the average temperature in New York City for the month of January 2023. The user would input \"New York City\" as the location and set the timeframe as January 1, 2023, to January 31, 2023. The function would then retrieve temperature data for each day in January from the relevant data sources, compute the average, and return the result.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- If the location specified does not have sufficient data available for the given timeframe, the function should handle this gracefully, possibly by returning a predefined message or error code indicating the lack of data.\n- In scenarios where the timeframe includes partial data or missing entries (such as days with missing temperature records), the function should account for these inconsistencies and either adjust the calculation or notify the user of potential inaccuracies.\n- The", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"location": {"type": "string", "description": "The city to get the average temperature for.

Conversely, for descending order, the elements will be sorted from the largest to the smallest value. By default, if no specific order is indicated, the function will typically sort the list in ascending order. \n\nThe function is versatile and can handle lists containing various comparable data types, such as numbers, strings, or other sortable objects.

For example, attempting to sort a list containing a mix of strings and numbers may lead to unexpected behavior unless explicitly handled.\n\nTo use this function effectively, users should pass the list they wish to sort as the primary argument. Additionally, they can specify a boolean parameter to indicate the desired sorting order.

It prepares data for machine learning models, ensuring numerical values are scaled properly and categorical variables are appropriately transformed.This function serves as a crucial preprocessing step in the pipeline of preparing data for machine learning models. The primary objective of this function is to transform raw input data into a format that can be effectively used by various machine learning algorithms. It achieves this by performing two key operations: normalization of numerical values and encoding of categorical variables.\n\nThe normalization process involves adjusting the scale of numerical features to ensure that they contribute equally to the model's performance. This is particularly important in cases where the numerical features have varying units or magnitudes. By bringing all numerical values to a consistent scale, often within a range such as [0, 1] or having a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, the function helps prevent any single feature from disproportionately influencing the model due to its scale.\n\nIn addition to normalization, this function also addresses categorical variables, which are non-numeric data types that represent categories or labels. Such variables need to be converted into a numerical form before being fed into machine learning models, as these models typically require numerical input. The function accomplishes this transformation through encoding techniques, such as one-hot encoding or label encoding. One-hot encoding transforms each categorical variable into a binary vector, ensuring that the model can understand and process these variables without assuming any inherent order or relationship. Label encoding assigns a unique integer to each category, which can be useful for certain algorithms that can handle ordinal relationships.\n\nBy performing normalization and encoding, the function ensures that the input data is in an optimal condition for training machine learning models, facilitating better performance and accuracy. This preprocessing step is essential for any data pipeline aiming to extract meaningful insights and predictions from data with diverse characteristics.\n\nExample usage:\nSuppose you have a dataset containing both numerical features, such as age and salary, and categorical features, like country or department.

This function takes as input the hour and minute of the clock, typically in a 12-hour format, and computes the smallest angle between the hour and minute hands. The angle is calculated in degrees and lies between 0 and 180 degrees, ensuring that the measure is the smallest possible angle rather than the reflex angle.\n\nTo perform this calculation, the function first determines the position of the hour hand based on both the hour and the minute provided. It acknowledges that the hour hand moves as time progresses, not only every hour but also with each passing minute. Specifically, the hour hand moves 0.5 degrees per minute (or 30 degrees per hour). For example, at 3:30, the hour hand is not exactly on the 3 but slightly ahead, at 105 degrees from the 12 o'clock position.\n\nSimilarly, the position of the minute hand is calculated based solely on the minutes given, moving at a rate of 6 degrees per minute. For instance, at 15 minutes past the hour, the minute hand will point at the 3, or 90 degrees from the 12 o'clock position.\n\nThe function calculates the absolute difference between the positions of the hour and minute hands to find the angle between them.

This calculation is fundamental in astrophysics, aiding in understanding the vast scales of space and the time it takes for information, in the form of light, to be transmitted across these distances.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **distance (float/int)**: The distance between the two celestial bodies. This value should be provided in meters (m) as it directly influences the time calculation. The accuracy of this parameter is crucial, as any error could lead to significant deviations in the calculated time.\n  \n- **speed_of_light (float, optional)**: The speed at which light travels, typically defined as approximately 299,792,458 meters per second (m/s) in a vacuum. This value is a constant in physics, but if the function allows for different mediums (e.g., through a planet's atmosphere), this parameter may be adjusted accordingly. By default, the function assumes light travels in a vacuum unless otherwise specified.\n\n#### Return Value:\n- **travel_time (float)**: The calculated time, expressed in seconds, that light takes to travel the specified distance. This output helps in visualizing the immense distances involved in space and can be critical for tasks such as calculating delay times for communication with spacecraft or observing astronomical phenomena.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- If the distance is zero, the function should return a travel time of zero seconds, as no time is needed for light to cover a non-existent distance.\n- Negative distances are physically impossible in this context; the function should handle such inputs appropriately, perhaps by raising an error or returning a null value to indicate an invalid distance.\n- Consideration should be given to the precision of the input data.

BMI is a numerical value derived from a person's weight and height, providing a reliable indicator to categorize individuals based on body mass, which helps assess whether they have a healthy body weight for a given height. This function typically takes two parameters: weight, often measured in kilograms (kg), and height, commonly measured in meters (m). The formula used to calculate BMI is:\n\n\\[ \\text{BMI} = \\frac{\\text{weight (kg)}}{\\text{height (m)}^2} \\]\n\nThe result of this calculation is a single numeric value, which can be used to classify individuals into various categories such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity, according to established BMI ranges. For example, a BMI less than 18.5 is considered underweight, a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered normal weight, a BMI from 25 to 29.9 indicates overweight, and a BMI of 30 or higher is classified as obese.\n\nSpecial considerations must be taken into account for certain populations such as athletes, children, pregnant women, and the elderly, for whom the BMI may not accurately reflect body fat or health status. Thus, while BMI is a useful screening tool, it should be used in conjunction with other health assessments to determine an individual's overall health and risk factors.\n\nExample Usage:\nTo calculate the BMI for a person weighing 70 kg with a height of 1.75 meters, you would use the function as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{BMI} = \\frac{70}{1.75^2} \\approx 22.86 \\]\n\nThis value suggests that the person falls within the normal weight category.

The normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution characterized by its bell-shaped curve, symmetrical around the mean. The function requires two parameters as input: the mean and the standard deviation. \n\nThe mean parameter represents the central tendency of the distribution, where the peak of the curve occurs. It is the point about which the data points are distributed symmetrically, and it determines the location of the center of the distribution on the number line.\n\nThe standard deviation parameter measures the amount of variation or dispersion from the mean. A smaller standard deviation indicates that the data points are closer to the mean, resulting in a steeper and narrower bell curve. Conversely, a larger standard deviation signifies that data points are spread out over a wider range of values, producing a flatter and wider curve.\n\nWhen the function is called, it utilizes the provided mean and standard deviation to calculate and return a random number.

It serves as a mechanism to efficiently handle multiple query classifications in a single execution, thereby streamlining the workflow for users who need to manage large datasets or multiple queries simultaneously.\n\nThe primary purpose of this function is to map each query to its corresponding intent classification based on the intent names that are passed as keyword arguments. By allowing keyword arguments, users have the flexibility to specify intent names that accurately describe the purpose or category of each query. This feature enables precise classification and organization of data, which is particularly useful in applications such as natural language processing, user interaction analysis, and automated response systems.\n\nIn practical usage, the function accepts several keyword arguments where each key corresponds to a query, and its value represents the intent name. For example, if you have a series of queries related to customer support interactions, you might use the function to assign intents like \"billing_inquiry\", \"technical_support\", or \"general_feedback\" to each query, thereby tagging them for further processing or analysis.\n\nAn edge case to consider when using this function is ensuring that the intent names provided in the keyword arguments are valid and recognized by the system. Invalid or misspelled intent names may result in misclassification or errors.

The result is then divided by four to determine the dividend per share for each quarter, assuming that the dividend is distributed evenly over four quarters of the fiscal year. \n\nThis function is particularly useful for investors looking to assess the amount of income they can expect to receive from their investment in the form of dividends on a quarterly basis. This calculation is crucial for making informed investment decisions and evaluating the return on investment for shareholders.\n\nFor example, if a company has a total annual dividend payout of $4,000,000 and there are 1,000,000 outstanding shares, the annual dividend per share would be $4.00 ($4,000,000 \u00f7 1,000,000). By dividing this figure by four, the quarterly dividend per share would be calculated as $1.00.\n\nIt is important to ensure that the number of outstanding shares is not zero, as this would lead to a division by zero error, rendering the function unable to provide a valid output. The function assumes that the dividend payout is distributed evenly across all shares and quarters, which may not account for any mid-year changes in the number of outstanding shares or uneven dividend distributions unless explicitly specified otherwise.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"total_payout": {"type": "integer", "description": "The total amount of dividends paid out in USD"}, "outstanding_shares": {"type": "integer", "description": "Total number of outstanding shares"}}, "required": ["total_payout", "outstanding_shares"], "optional": []}}, {"name": "finance.calculate_quarterly_dividend_per_share2", "description": "Calculate quarterly dividend per share for a company given total dividend payout and outstanding shares This function is actively maintained.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"total_payout": {"type": "integer", "description": "The total amount of dividends paid out in USD"}, "outstanding_shares": {"type": "integer", "description": "Total number of outstanding shares"}}, "required": ["total_payout", "outstanding_shares"], "optional": []}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\nfinance.calculate_quarterly_dividend_per_share2({'total_payout': 50000000, 'outstanding_shares': 100000000})", "model_result_decoded": [{"finance.calculate_quarterly_dividend_per_share2": {}}], "possible_answer": [{"finance.calculate_quarterly_dividend_per_share1": {"total_payout": [50000000], "outstanding_shares": [100000000]}}, {"finance.calculate_quarterly_dividend_per_share2": {"total_payout": [50000000], "outstanding_shares": [100000000]}}, {"finance.calculate_quarterly_dividend_per_share3": {"total_payout": [50000000], "outstanding_shares": [100000000]}}]}

This metric indicates how effectively the company is using the capital invested by its shareholders to generate profits.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **Net Income**: This is the total profit of the company after all expenses and taxes have been deducted from total revenue. It represents the company's earnings over a specific period, typically a fiscal quarter or year. Net income is a critical input for calculating ROE as it reflects the profitability generated from shareholders' investments.\n\n2. **Shareholder's Equity**: This represents the total equity ownership in the company, which is the residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting liabilities. It includes the amount initially invested by shareholders plus any retained earnings. Shareholder's equity is crucial for the ROE calculation as it forms the denominator in determining how much profit is generated per unit of equity.\n\n3. **Dividends Paid**: These are the distributions made by the company to its shareholders, derived from its net income. While dividends represent a return to shareholders, they are subtracted from net income in certain calculations to reflect the earnings retained in the business. However, in the context of standard ROE calculations, dividends are generally not deducted from net income as ROE typically measures the return on the total equity base rather than retained earnings.\n\n#### Calculation:\n\nThe formula used for calculating Return on Equity is:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Shareholder's Equity}} \\]\n\nThis formula provides a percentage that signifies the return generated on every dollar of equity. For example, an ROE of 15% indicates that for every dollar of equity, the company generates $0.15 in profit.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose a company has a net income of $200,000, shareholder's", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"net_income": {"type": "integer", "description": "The company's net income."}, "shareholder_equity": {"type": "integer", "description": "The company's total shareholder's equity."}, "dividends_paid": {"type": "integer", "description": "The total dividends paid by the company.

It is a critical input as it forms the base on which future returns are calculated.\n\n2. **Expected Annual Return**: This input is the anticipated rate of return on the investment per year, expressed as a percentage. The return rate is an estimation of how much the investment is expected to grow annually, factoring in various market conditions and the performance of the specific stock.\n\n3. **Number of Years**: This parameter indicates the time horizon over which the investment is expected to grow. It is measured in years and directly influences the calculation, as the effects of compounding interest depend on the duration the investment is held.\n\nThe function applies the formula for compound interest to determine the future value of the investment. The formula used is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Future Value} = \\text{Invested Amount} \\times (1 + \\frac{\\text{Expected Annual Return}}{100})^{\\text{Number of Years}} \\]\n\nThis calculation assumes that the investment will grow steadily at the expected annual return rate, with earnings reinvested each year, thus benefiting from the compounding effect over the number of years specified.

This capability allows the function to interact directly with the operating system's command line interface to perform tasks or operations as specified by the user. It is capable of executing a single command as well as multiple commands in sequence when they are chained together using the '&&' operator.

It is important to ensure that these identifiers are correct and correspond to publicly traded companies, as incorrect or non-existent symbols may lead to errors or null results being returned.\n\nThe function handles various edge cases, such as closed markets or stock price unavailability due to holidays, by either returning the last available closing price or indicating the data is not currently available. Additionally, network issues or data source errors are accounted for, with the function designed to fail gracefully or retry when possible. \n\nUsage Example:\n```python\n# Assuming the function is named `get_current_stock_prices`\ncompanies = ['AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'MSFT']\ncurrent_prices = get_current_stock_prices(companies)\nprint(current_prices)  # Output might be {'AAPL': 150.25, 'GOOGL': 2800.50, 'MSFT': 300.10}\n```\n\nIn this example, the function is used to retrieve the current stock prices for Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., and Microsoft Corporation by using their respective ticker symbols on a stock exchange. The output is typically a dictionary or similar data structure where each key is a company identifier, and the associated value is the current stock price. This provides a quick and easy way to access financial data for further processing or display.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"company_names": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "The list of companies for which to retrieve the stock price."}}, "required": ["company_names"]}}, {"name": "get_stock_price2", "description": "Retrieves the current stock price of the specified companies This function is actively maintained.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"company_names": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "The list of companies for which to retrieve the stock price."}}, "required": ["company_names"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\nget_stock_price1(['AAPL', 'MSFT'])", "model_result_decoded": [{"get_stock_price1": {}}], "possible_answer": [{"get_stock_price1": {"company_names": [["Apple", "Microsoft"], [["Apple"], ["Microsoft"]], ["AAPL", "MSFT"]]}}, {"get_stock_price2": {"company_names": [["Apple", "Microsoft"], [["Apple"], ["Microsoft"]], ["AAPL", "MSFT"]]}}, {"get_stock_price3": {"company_names": [["Apple", "Microsoft"], [["Apple"], ["Microsoft"]], ["AAPL", "MSFT"]]}}]}

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.The function described is designed to execute system-level commands on Windows operating systems by utilizing the `os.system()` function from the Python Standard Library. This function allows you to run commands as if you were typing them directly into the Windows command prompt. It is versatile in that it can execute simple, standalone commands such as 'dir' to list directory contents or more complex sequences of commands.\n\nWhen executing multiple commands, these can be chained together using the '&&' operator. The '&&' operator is particularly useful because it ensures that each subsequent command is only executed if the preceding command completes successfully without errors. For example, a call to this function with the input `'mkdir new_folder && cd new_folder && echo File created > new_file.txt'` would first attempt to create a new directory named 'new_folder'. If this command succeeds, it will then change the current working directory to 'new_folder'. Finally, if the directory change is successful, it will execute the 'echo' command to create a file named 'new_file.txt' inside the new directory with the text 'File created'.\n\nThis function is predominantly used in scenarios where automated tasks or scripts require the execution of shell commands, such as in deployment scripts, build processes, or other system administration tasks. It's important to note that since `os.system()` utilizes the underlying shell, any valid command line instruction can be passed to it, but with caution due to potential security implications. It is essential to validate or sanitize any input that might be constructed dynamically to avoid attacks like command injection.\n\nParameters that are passed to this function must be strings representing the exact command(s) one wishes to execute.

Specifically, this function is intended for use on Windows operating systems, where it provides the capability to run commands in the Windows command line environment.\n\nThe core functionality of this function includes the execution of a single command or, if needed, multiple commands that are strategically linked together using the '&&' operator.

This functionality allows for the execution of command-line operations directly from within a Python script, thereby enabling automation of tasks that would typically require manual execution through a command prompt.\n\nWhen using this function, you have the flexibility to execute either a single command or a series of commands chained together. Chaining is achieved by using the '&&' operator, which allows you to execute multiple commands sequentially. In this context, the '&&' operator ensures that each command is executed in order, and the subsequent command is only executed if the preceding command is successful. This feature is particularly useful for tasks that depend on the successful completion of prior commands.\n\nFor instance, if you need to navigate to a specific directory and then list the files within that directory, you could chain these commands as follows: `cd path\\to\\directory && dir`. This sequence first changes the current directory to 'path\\to\\directory' and, upon successful execution, lists the contents of that directory.\n\nIt is important to note that `os.system()` returns the exit status of the command executed, which can be used to determine if the command was successful. An exit status of zero typically indicates success, while any non-zero value signifies an error.

This number is crucial for distinguishing between cases, especially in legal systems where multiple cases can have similar names or parties involved.\n   - **Example:** '2021ABC1234'\n\n2. **Year (Integer):**\n   - This parameter specifies the year in which the case was either initiated or adjudicated. It helps narrow down the search, especially in jurisdictions where case numbers might reset annually or where cases span over multiple years.\n   - **Example:** 2021\n\n3. **Court (String):**\n   - The official name or code of the court where the case is being or was heard. Different courts might have jurisdiction over different types of cases (e.g., civil, criminal, appellate), and specifying the court is vital to accurately locate the case records.\n   - **Example:** 'Supreme Court', 'District Court', 'Court of Appeals'\n\n#### Functionality:\n\nUpon execution, the function queries the relevant legal database using the provided parameters. It retrieves and returns all available details related to the specified case, such as parties involved, case status, judgments, and any other pertinent information that is stored in the legal system. This function is especially useful for lawyers, researchers, or any individual seeking to gain a complete understanding of a particular law case based on its identifying details.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Invalid or Non-existent Case Number:** If the case number does not exist in the database or has been entered incorrectly, the function should return a clear error message indicating the issue.\n-", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"case_number": {"type": "integer", "description": "The specific number of the law case."}, "court": {"type": "string", "description": "The city name where the court takes place"}, "year": {"type": "integer", "description": "The year in which the law case took place."}}, "required": ["case_number", "court", "year"]}}, {"name": "fetch_law_case_details2", "description": "Fetch details of a specific law case based on case number, year and court.

The calculation is based on three primary factors: the distance the vehicle travels in a year, the type of fuel used by the vehicle, and its fuel efficiency.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n1. **Distance Traveled (annual_distance):** This represents the total distance covered by the vehicle over the course of a year. It is usually measured in miles or kilometers, depending on the preferred unit system. Accurate input of this parameter is crucial as it directly influences the resulting emissions calculation.\n\n2. **Fuel Type (fuel_type):** This denotes the type of fuel the vehicle uses. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, natural gas, and electricity. Different fuels emit varying amounts of CO2 when consumed, and this parameter allows the function to use the appropriate emission factor for the calculation. \n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency (fuel_efficiency):** This is a measure of how effectively a vehicle uses fuel, typically expressed in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). Higher fuel efficiency indicates that the vehicle can travel more distance using less fuel, thus producing fewer emissions for the same distance traveled.\n\n**Calculation Process:**\n\nThe core calculation involves determining the total fuel consumption for the given distance based on the vehicle's fuel efficiency. Once the total fuel consumption is established, the function applies the specific emission factor associated with the fuel type to calculate the total CO2 emissions. The emission factor is a standard value that indicates the amount of CO2 released per unit of fuel consumed.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n- **Extreme Values for Distance:** When calculating emissions for vehicles that travel extremely high or low annual distances, ensure that the inputs remain realistic. For instance, commuting vehicles may have significantly lower distances compared to long-haul trucks.\n\n- **Fuel Efficiency Limits:** Consider edge cases where fuel efficiency is unusually high or", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"distance": {"type": "integer", "description": "The distance travelled in miles."}, "fuel_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of fuel used by the vehicle."}, "fuel_efficiency": {"type": "float", "description": "The vehicle's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon."}, "efficiency_reduction": {"type": "integer", "description": "The percentage decrease in fuel efficiency per year (optional).

It is particularly useful for those who are looking for libraries with certain amenities and resources. The main criteria available for this search include:\n\n1. **English Fiction Availability**: Users can specify that they are looking for libraries that have a collection of English fiction books. This criterion is beneficial for English-speaking patrons or those interested in exploring literature written in English. It ensures that the libraries identified have a selection of novels, short stories, and other fiction genres available in English.\n\n2. **Wi-Fi Availability**: The function also allows users to search for libraries that provide Wi-Fi access. This criterion is important for individuals who require internet connectivity for studying, research, or personal use while at the library. Ensuring this service is available can significantly enhance the user experience, particularly for those who need to use online resources or simply wish to stay connected while visiting the library.\n\n### Usage Example:\n\n- A user is planning a visit to a new city and wants to find a nearby library. They require access to English fiction for leisure reading and need to be able to connect to the internet via Wi-Fi for work.

It operates by receiving a unique identifier or a distinct reference to the particular neuron whose location data is sought. Upon execution, the function will return the coordinates, typically in a three-dimensional format, representing the neuron's precise position within the rat's brain structure.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **neuron_id**: A required parameter that serves as the unique identifier for the neuron. This could be in the form of a string or a numerical value, depending on how neurons are catalogued in the data source. The identifier ensures that the function retrieves the correct neuron, especially in datasets containing numerous neurons.\n\n#### Return Value:\n\n- The function outputs the coordinates of the specified neuron. These coordinates are usually provided as a tuple or list containing three numerical values, corresponding to the x, y, and z axes in the brain's anatomical space. This three-dimensional data is crucial for determining the neuron's exact location within the complex structure of the rat's brain.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Invalid Neuron ID**: If a neuron_id is provided that does not correspond to any known neuron in the dataset, the function should handle this gracefully, either by returning a null value or raising an appropriate exception that highlights the issue.\n  \n- **Coordinate Precision**: The precision of the returned coordinates might vary depending on the resolution of the data available. Users must be aware that higher precision may be crucial for detailed analyses or applications.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nTo utilize this function effectively, a user would first ensure that they have the correct identifier for the desired neuron. For instance:\n\n```python\n# Assume neuron_id '1234' corresponds to a particular neuron\ncoordinates = retrieve_neuron_coordinates('1234')\nprint(coordinates)\n```\n\nIn this example, the function call retrieves the spatial coordinates of the neuron identified by '1234'.

Higher input or weight increases firing rate and higher decay rate decreases it.The function calculates the neuronal activity, specifically the rate at which a neuron fires, by taking into account several critical factors: the input synaptic rate, the weight of the inputs, and the decay rate. Each of these parameters plays a vital role in determining the overall firing rate of the neuron.\n\n1. **Input Synaptic Rate**: This is the frequency or rate at which synaptic inputs are received by the neuron. It represents how often the neuron is stimulated by incoming signals from other neurons. A higher input synaptic rate indicates that the neuron is receiving a large number of signals in a given time period, which typically leads to an increase in the neuron's firing rate.\n\n2. **Weight of Inputs**: This parameter measures the strength or influence of the synaptic inputs on the neuron. Each synapse connecting to a neuron can have a different weight, representing its significance. Larger weights signify stronger synaptic connections, thereby increasing the likelihood of the neuron firing. When the weight of inputs is high, even a moderate input synaptic rate can lead to a substantial increase in the firing rate.\n\n3. **Decay Rate**: This represents the rate at which the neuron's firing rate decreases over time in the absence of incoming signals. Essentially, it characterizes how quickly the neuron's activity diminishes when not actively stimulated. A higher decay rate means the neuron's firing rate will decrease more rapidly, effectively counteracting the effects of high input synaptic rates or weights. Thus, an increase in decay rate results in a decrease in the firing rate.\n\nBy considering these parameters, the function computes the neuron's firing rate, balancing the excitation from input synaptic rates and weights against the inhibition from the decay rate. For instance, if a neuron receives a high synaptic input rate and the weights of these inputs are significant, it will fire more frequently unless the decay rate is also notably high, which would reduce the firing rate.

To perform this calculation, the function requires two input parameters: weight and height. \n\nThe weight parameter should be provided in kilograms (kg), and the height parameter should be provided in meters (m). The formula used within the function to compute the BMI is defined as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{BMI} = \\frac{\\text{weight}}{(\\text{height} \\times \\text{height})} \\]\n\nThis formula divides the weight in kilograms by the square of the height in meters. The resulting BMI value is a numerical figure that can be used to assess whether an individual has a healthy body weight for a person of their height.\n\nThe function will return a floating-point number representing the BMI. This number can be interpreted using standard BMI categories, which are as follows:\n- A BMI of less than 18.5 is considered underweight.\n- A BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered normal weight.\n- A BMI of 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight.\n- A BMI of 30 or above is considered obese.\n\nIt is important to note that while BMI is a useful screening tool, it does not directly measure body fat, and other factors such as muscle mass, bone density, and overall body composition are not accounted for in this calculation. Therefore, BMI should be used as a general guideline rather than an absolute measure of an individual's health or fitness level.\n\nExample usage of the function:\nSuppose an individual weighs 70 kilograms and is 1.75 meters tall. By plugging these values into the function:\n\\[ \\text{BMI} = \\frac{70}{(1.75 \\times 1.75)} \\]\nThe calculated BMI will be approximately 22.86, placing the individual within the normal weight category according to the standard classifications. \n\nEdge cases to", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"weight": {"type": "integer", "description": "The weight of a person in kilograms."}, "height": {"type": "integer", "description": "The height of a person in centimeters."}, "unit": {"type": "string", "description": "Optional.

This is crucial for ensuring that the paint is applied evenly and effectively across the entire surface without running short or having excess. \n\nTo achieve this, the function takes two primary inputs:\n\n1. **Surface Area (required input):** This parameter represents the total area that needs to be covered with paint. It is typically measured in square units, such as square feet or square meters, depending on the region or preference. The surface area can be calculated based on the dimensions of the area to be painted, such as walls, ceilings, or any surface needing a coat of paint.\n\n2. **Coverage Rate (required input):** This input specifies how much area a single unit (often a gallon or liter) of the paint can cover. The coverage rate is usually provided by the manufacturer and can vary based on paint quality, type, and color. It is usually expressed in square units per unit of paint, indicating the efficiency of the paint in covering surfaces.\n\nThe function uses these inputs to compute the total amount of paint necessary by dividing the surface area by the coverage rate. The result gives the number of paint units needed to cover the area completely. This calculation ensures that you know the exact number of paint units to purchase, which helps in budgeting and planning for any painting project.\n\nAn example usage scenario could be: If you have a surface area of 500 square feet and the paint you are using has a coverage rate of 350 square feet per gallon, the function will calculate that you need approximately 1.43 gallons of paint.

The function then searches available concert listings to identify events that match the specified criteria.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **Location** (string): \n   - This parameter specifies the geographical area where the user wishes to attend a concert. It can be a city, state, or even a specific venue name. The function will focus its search on this specified region to ensure the results are relevant to the user's needs.\n\n2. **Budget** (numeric):\n   - This parameter represents the maximum amount of money the user is willing to spend on concert tickets. It includes all fees and taxes, ensuring that the resulting list of concerts does not exceed this financial limit. The function filters out any concerts with ticket prices that surpass the specified budget, providing only those options that are financially accessible to the user.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- If the location parameter is left empty or undefined, the function defaults to a broader search, possibly the entire country or a predefined default location, which should be clarified in the function's implementation.\n- If the budget is set to zero or a negative number, the function should either return no results or prompt the user to enter a valid budget, as concert tickets generally require a positive expenditure.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\n```python\n# Example of locating a concert in New York with a budget of $100\nconcerts = LocateConcert(\"New York\", 100)\nprint(concerts)\n```\n\nIn this example, the function will search for concerts being held in New York where ticket prices do not exceed $100.

It takes into account two main parameters: the music scale and the desired duration of the mix. By manipulating these parameters, users can create a unique version of a song that adheres to a particular musical scale and fits within a specified time frame.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **Music Scale**: \n   - The music scale parameter determines the tonal framework of the mix. This could include major, minor, pentatonic, or other scales, each providing a distinct mood and character to the mix. The choice of scale influences the notes and chords used in the song, resulting in a mix that aligns with the desired musical qualities.\n   - Users should ensure that the chosen scale is compatible with the original song's key to maintain musical coherence and harmony.\n\n2. **Duration**:\n   - The duration parameter specifies the target length of the song mix. It is defined in standard time units, such as seconds or minutes. The function will adjust the song's structure, possibly by altering the tempo, repeating sections, or trimming parts, to fit within the specified duration.\n   - Care should be taken to choose a duration that allows for a coherent musical flow, avoiding abrupt transitions or excessively long repetitive sections.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose a user wants to create a mix of a popular song in a minor scale lasting exactly three minutes. They would provide 'minor' as the music scale parameter and '3:00' as the duration. The function would then process the song, ensuring that the mix stays true to the emotional depth of a minor scale while precisely meeting the three-minute requirement.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Mismatch in Scale and Key**: If the chosen scale doesn't match well with the original song's key, the resulting mix may sound dissonant or jarring.

This function takes two primary inputs: the musical key and the number of chords to include in the progression. \n\nThe first parameter specifies the key in which the chord progression will be constructed. This key provides the tonal center around which the chords will be organized, ensuring that the progression maintains a consistent harmonic context. For example, if the key of C major is chosen, the chords generated will be based on the notes of the C major scale, such as C major, D minor, E minor, and so on.\n\nThe second parameter determines the number of chords in the progression. This allows for flexibility in creating progressions of varying lengths, tailored to the musical form or section you are composing. Whether you need a simple four-chord progression for a verse or a more complex eight-chord sequence for a bridge, this parameter can be adjusted to meet your musical needs.\n\nThe function might include considerations for common chord progressions, such as the I-IV-V-I pattern, which is prevalent in many genres of music, from classical to pop. It could also account for more sophisticated progressions, depending on the key and the number of chords specified.\n\nUsage example: To use this function, specify the desired key and the number of chords.

When a key is given as input, the function identifies the major scale associated with that key, and then calculates the third chord in the sequence of chords that naturally arise from that scale. In music theory, each key is associated with a specific set of notes that form a major scale, and chords are built from these notes by stacking thirds. The third major chord in this context refers to the chord that is built on the third degree, or note, of the major scale of the specified key.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **key** (string): This parameter represents the musical key in which the chord should be calculated. The key is typically expressed as a letter name (e.g., \"C\", \"G\", \"F#\"), which can include a sharp (#) or flat (b) symbol to indicate accidentals.\n\n#### Function Behavior:\n1. **Determine the Major Scale**: The function first establishes the major scale based on the provided key. For instance, if the input key is \"C\", the major scale would consist of the notes C, D, E, F, G, A, and B.\n\n2. **Identify the Third Scale Degree**: Once the major scale is determined, the function identifies the third note within this scale. Continuing with the example of the key of \"C\", the third note is \"E\".\n\n3. **Construct the Major Chord**: The third major chord is constructed using the third note as the root. A major chord is typically formed by taking the root note, adding the note located a major third above it, and then adding the note a perfect fifth above the root. For the example with the root note \"E\", the chord will include the notes E, G#, and B.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n- **Example**: If the input key is \"G\", the major", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"key": {"type": "string", "description": "The key of the scale."}, "type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of the scale, either major or minor.

This function is particularly useful for analyzing the performance trends of a player within a given timeframe, helping coaches, analysts, and enthusiasts make informed assessments.\n\n#### Parameters\n- **playerName**: A string parameter that specifies the full name of the cricketer whose average batting score is to be calculated. It is essential to provide the correct and complete name to ensure accurate retrieval of match data.\n- **numberOfMatches**: An integer parameter that indicates the number of past matches to consider for calculating the batting average. This value must be positive and can be adjusted to analyze different periods of performance, whether recent or more extended historical spans.\n\n#### Functionality\nThe function works by accessing a dataset or database that contains detailed records of cricket matches. It retrieves the scores achieved by the specified cricketer in the past number of matches identified. These scores are then summed and divided by the `numberOfMatches` to compute the average. This average provides insight into the player's batting performance over the selected period.\n\n#### Edge Cases and Considerations\n- **Insufficient Data**: If the `numberOfMatches` exceeds the total matches played by the cricketer, the function should handle this gracefully, possibly by limiting the calculation to the available matches and notifying the user.\n- **Data Availability**: Ensure that the function has access to a reliable data source containing comprehensive match records to prevent misinformation.\n- **Error Handling**: The function should include error-checking mechanisms to handle incorrect inputs, such as a non-existent player name or an invalid number of matches (e.g., negative numbers).\n\n#### Usage Example\n```python\n# Example usage of the getAverageBattingScore function\n\n# Calculate the average batting score for 'John Doe' over the last 5 matches", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"player_name": {"type": "string", "description": "Name of the cricket player."}, "matches": {"type": "integer", "description": "Number of past matches to consider for average calculation."}, "match_format": {"type": "string", "description": "Format of the cricket matches considered (e.g., 'T20', 'ODI', 'Test').

This function takes into consideration two essential parameters: the season and the type of competition. By specifying these parameters, users can obtain accurate and relevant rankings that reflect the team's performance during the specified timeframe and competition category.\n\n### Parameters:\n\n1. **Season**: This parameter determines the specific timeframe for which the team ranking is to be retrieved. It typically involves a year or a range of years that corresponds to a particular sports season. For example, a season might be represented as \"2022\" or \"2021-2022\" depending on the sport's convention.\n\n2. **Type**: This parameter indicates the category or type of competition within the sports league. It might refer to different divisions, such as \"regular season,\" \"playoffs,\" or specific tournaments within the league, allowing for a focused retrieval of rankings based on the competition's nature.\n\n### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose you are interested in finding out the ranking of a basketball team for the 2021-2022 season during the playoffs. You would call the `GetTeamRanking` function with the parameters set as follows:\n\n- **Season**: \"2021-2022\"\n- **Type**: \"playoffs\"\n\nThis would return the team's position relative to others in the same league during the postseason. The function is particularly useful for sports analysts, fans, and team managers who need to assess performance, compare teams, or make strategic decisions based on historical data.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Invalid Season**: If the specified season does not exist or data is unavailable for that particular season, the function should handle this gracefully, possibly by returning a message indicating the lack of data.\n- **Unsupported Type**: If a type is provided that is not recognized by the system (for example, a misspelling or a type not applicable to the league's structure), the function should provide guidance or suggestions for", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"team_name": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the sports team."}, "league": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the league in which the team competes."}, "season": {"type": "string", "description": "The season for which the team's ranking is sought."}, "type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of the season: regular or playoff.", "enum": ["regular", "playoff"]}}, "required": ["team_name", "league", "season", "type"]}}, {"name": "get_team_rank2", "description": "Get the team ranking in a sports league based on season and type.

This functionality can be particularly useful for sports analysts, journalists, or enthusiasts who wish to examine trends over time or compare a team's standing in different years.\n\n### Parameters:\n\n- `team_name` (string): The name of the soccer team for which you would like to obtain the FIFA ranking. It is important to ensure that the team name is spelled correctly and corresponds to the recognized name used by FIFA to avoid errors or inaccurate results.\n\n- `year` (integer): The specific year for which you want to retrieve the ranking. This should be a four-digit year (e.g., 2021) and should fall within the range of years for which FIFA rankings are available. Attempting to access a ranking for a year outside this range may result in an error or a null result.\n\n### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose you want to find out the FIFA ranking for the Brazilian national team in the year 2018.

Initially, the function begins with a deck consisting of 52 cards, each representing one of the unique cards found in a standard deck. These cards include four suits\u2014hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades\u2014each containing 13 ranks, ranging from Ace to King.\n\nThe first operation executed by the function is shuffling. Shuffling involves randomizing the order of the cards in the deck to ensure that they are mixed thoroughly. This randomization process is essential to remove any predictability from the deck's order, simulating the act of shuffling cards in a real-world scenario. The shuffling should ideally be unbiased, meaning that each possible permutation of the card order is equally likely.\n\nOnce the deck is shuffled, the function proceeds to the second operation: drawing a specified number of cards from the top of the shuffled deck. The number of cards to be drawn is provided as an input parameter to the function, allowing the user to specify how many cards they wish to draw from the deck.

A standard deck consists of 52 cards, which are divided into four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit contains 13 cards, ranging from Ace to King. The total number of unique cards in the deck ensures various combinations and probabilities based on the desired card or suit.\n\nThe probability of drawing a specific card, such as the Queen of Hearts, is determined by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes in the deck. Since there is only one Queen of Hearts in the entire deck, the probability is calculated as 1/52.\n\nSimilarly, if the objective is to calculate the probability of drawing a card from a particular suit, such as hearts, the function considers the 13 possible favorable outcomes (all the hearts in the deck) against the total 52 cards. Therefore, the probability of drawing a card from the hearts suit is 13/52, which simplifies to 1/4.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- If any cards have been removed from the deck, the total number of cards and the specific number of cards in each suit must be adjusted accordingly when calculating probabilities.\n- The function assumes a fair deck, meaning each card has an equal chance of being drawn.\n\n### Usage Example:\nSuppose you're interested in finding out the probability of drawing an Ace from a full deck. The function would take the input specifying the card rank \"Ace\" and without specifying a suit, calculate that there are 4 Aces in the deck. Thus, the probability of drawing an Ace would be 4/52, which reduces to 1/13.

The calorie content is expected to be an integer or a numeric value that represents the total calories of the recipe. This parameter can be used to locate recipes that have a specific calorie count, making it useful for individuals who are tracking their dietary intake or managing their nutritional goals.\n\nThe function combines these two parameters to filter and locate recipes that match the given criteria. It is particularly useful in databases or applications where recipes are stored with their respective names and nutritional information. By using this function, users can quickly find recipes that not only meet their taste preferences but also align with their dietary requirements.\n\nUsage Example:\nSuppose a user is looking for a recipe named \"Chicken Salad\" with exactly 350 calories. By inputting these values into the function, it will search through the available recipe database and return the specific recipe that matches both the name \"Chicken Salad\" and the calorie count of 350. If no exact match is found, the function may return an empty set or a message indicating no recipes meet the criteria, ensuring the user is informed of the search outcome.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"recipeName": {"type": "string", "description": "The recipe's name."}, "maxCalories": {"type": "integer", "description": "The maximum calorie content of the recipe.", "default": 1000}}, "required": ["recipeName"]}}, {"name": "find_recipe2", "description": "Locate a recipe based on name and its calorie content This function is actively maintained.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"recipeName": {"type": "string", "description": "The recipe's name."}, "maxCalories": {"type": "integer", "description": "The maximum calorie content of the recipe.", "default": 1000}}, "required": ["recipeName"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\nfind_recipe1({'recipeName': 'pasta carbonara', 'maxCalories': 500})", "model_result_decoded": [{"find_recipe1": {}}], "possible_answer": [{"find_recipe1": {"recipeName": ["pasta carbonara"], "maxCalories": [500]}}, {"find_recipe2": {"recipeName": ["pasta carbonara"], "maxCalories": [500]}}, {"find_recipe3": {"recipeName": ["pasta carbonara"], "maxCalories": [500]}}]}

In such cases, the function may return multiple results or indicate that no parking lots are available within the specified parameters.\n\nExample usage of the function could involve a user inputting their current geographic coordinates as the 'specific location' and setting a desired search 'radius' to find an appropriate parking lot nearby. The function will then provide the nearest parking lot's details, such as its name, address, and distance from the user's location. This is particularly useful in urban settings or unfamiliar areas where convenient parking options need to be identified quickly.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"location": {"type": "string", "description": "The reference location e.g. Central Park, NY"}, "radius": {"type": "integer", "description": "The maximum distance from the location in miles.

Unlike simple distance calculations, such as the Euclidean distance which assumes a flat, featureless plane, this function incorporates variations in the terrain that can affect the actual travel distance.\n\nThe function takes as input parameters the coordinates of the two locations, typically provided as latitude and longitude pairs. Additionally, it requires data or information regarding the terrain, which may include elevation changes, obstacles, and other geographical features that might influence the path between the two points. The terrain data can be supplied as a digital elevation model (DEM), a terrain map, or other relevant geographical information systems (GIS) data.\n\nBy utilizing this terrain information, the function can more accurately reflect real-world distances, providing a result that is representative of the actual path one might take when traversing the terrain. This can be especially useful in applications such as hiking, off-road navigation, or planning routes in areas with significant geographical features.\n\nMoreover, the function can also consider specific factors such as the slope of the terrain, the presence of water bodies, and vegetation covers, among others. These factors can all impact travel time and distance, making this function highly valuable for applications requiring precise travel estimates.\n\nUsage Example:\nSuppose you have two points: Point A (latitude 34.0522, longitude -118.2437) and Point B (latitude 36.1699, longitude -115.1398), and you have access to terrain data of the area between these points. By calling this function with these parameters, you will receive an output that reflects the distance accounting for the terrain, rather than just the straight-line distance.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- If the terrain data provided is incomplete or contains errors, the function may not be able to calculate an accurate distance.\n- In cases where terrain data is not available, the function might default to a less accurate distance calculation method, such as the Euclidean or great-circle", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"origin": {"type": "string", "description": "Starting location of the distance measurement."}, "destination": {"type": "string", "description": "Destination location of the distance measurement."}, "consider_terrain": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether to account for terrain in distance calculation, defaults to false."}}, "required": ["origin", "destination"]}}, {"name": "distance_calculator.calculate2", "description": "Calculate the distance between two locations, considering terrain.
