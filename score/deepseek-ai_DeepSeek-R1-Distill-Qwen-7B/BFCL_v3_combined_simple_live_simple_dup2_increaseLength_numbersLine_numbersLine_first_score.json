In the geometric context, the Euclidean norm represents the length of the vector that extends from the origin, (0,0), to a given point (x, y) in a two-dimensional space. This length is equivalent to the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed with the x-axis and y-axis as the other two sides.

In calculus, the derivative represents the rate at which a function is changing at any given point and is a fundamental concept for understanding the behavior of functions in terms of slopes and instantaneous rates of change. \n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **function**: This parameter represents the mathematical function whose derivative is to be computed. The function should be provided in a form that the derivative calculation can interpret, such as a lambda expression, a symbolic expression, or any other suitable representation supported by the function.\n\n2. **value**: This parameter is the specific point at which the derivative is to be evaluated. It should be a numerical value that lies within the domain of the function provided.\n\n#### Functionality Details:\n\n- The function utilizes the principles of differential calculus to determine the derivative. It may employ numerical methods such as finite differences if the function is not provided in a symbolic form or if an analytical derivative is not readily available.\n  \n- The calculation involves evaluating the slope of the tangent line to the curve of the function at the given value. Mathematically, this is equivalent to finding the limit of the average rate of change of the function as the interval approaches zero.\n\n- The result of the function is a numerical approximation of the derivative at the specified point. For functions that are continuous and differentiable at the point in question, this approximation will be very close to the true derivative.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- If the function is not differentiable at the specified value (for example, if there is a cusp, corner, or vertical tangent), the function may return an error or a special value indicating that the derivative cannot be determined.\n\n- For cases where the value is at the boundary of the domain of the function, the derivative may be one-sided unless additional context is provided or the function is extended appropriately.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\n```python\n#", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"function": {"type": "string", "description": "The function to calculate the derivative of."}, "value": {"type": "integer", "description": "The value where the derivative needs to be calculated at."}, "function_variable": {"type": "string", "description": "The variable present in the function, for instance x or y, etc. Default is 'x'."}}, "required": ["function", "value"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\ncalculus.derivative1('2*x**2', 1, {'function_variable': 'x'})", "model_result_decoded": [{"calculus.derivative1": {}}], "possible_answer": [{"calculus.derivative1": {"function": ["2x**2", "lambda x: 2x**2"], "value": [1], "function_variable": ["x", ""]}}, {"calculus.derivative2": {"function": ["2x**2", "lambda x: 2x**2"], "value": [1], "function_variable": ["x", ""]}}, {"calculus.derivative3": {"function": ["2x**2", "lambda x: 2x**2"], "value": [1], "function_variable": ["x", ""]}}]}

The primary purpose of this function is to ensure that the food name inputted by the user adheres to a specific format requirement: it must be entirely in uppercase letters. This helps maintain consistency and potentially matches system constraints or database formats that require uppercase entries.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **foodName (string):** The name of the food item that the customer wishes to select or change to. This parameter is expected to be provided by the user or calling process. It is crucial that the provided food name is already converted to uppercase before being passed to this function, as this function does not handle the conversion but strictly enforces the uppercase format requirement.\n\n#### Behavior:\n- The function will check the provided `foodName` to ensure it is entirely in uppercase. If the name does not meet this requirement, the function might return an error or prompt for correction, depending on the system's error handling practices. \n- Assuming the `foodName` is correctly formatted, the function will proceed to update the current food selection to reflect the customer's request. This could involve updating a database record, altering an order list, or modifying an in-memory object that tracks current selections.\n- The function operates under the assumption that the input has been validated for existence and correctness beforehand, focusing solely on enforcing the uppercase format and updating the selection.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nTo use this function effectively, ensure the food name is in uppercase before calling the function.

If the object is initially at rest, this value will be zero.\n  \n- **Height (h)**: This specifies the vertical distance the object falls from its starting point to its endpoint. It should be a positive value, and it is normally measured in meters or feet, depending on the unit system in use.\n  \n- **Acceleration due to Gravity (g)**: This constant represents the rate at which the object's velocity increases as it falls. On Earth, this value is typically approximately 9.81 m/s\u00b2 in the metric system or 32.2 ft/s\u00b2 in the imperial system, though it can vary slightly depending on the location's altitude or local gravitational anomalies.\n\n#### Calculation:\nThe final velocity \\( v \\) of a free-falling object can be determined using the following equation derived from the fundamental kinematics equations:\n\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{v\u2080^2 + 2gh} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( v \\) is the final velocity of the object.\n- \\( v\u2080 \\) is the initial velocity.\n- \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity.\n- \\( h \\) is the height from which the object is dropped.\n\nThis equation calculates the magnitude of the velocity vector of the object just before it impacts the ground, assuming it falls vertically.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nSuppose an object is dropped from", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"height": {"type": "integer", "description": "The height the object is dropped from, in meters."}, "initial_velocity": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial velocity of the object in m/s.

This calculation is rooted in the principles of classical mechanics, specifically the kinematic equations that describe motion.\n\nTo determine the final velocity, the function uses the kinematic equation:\n\n\\[ v_f = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot a \\cdot d} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( v_f \\) represents the final velocity of the object,\n- \\( a \\) is the constant acceleration of the object, and\n- \\( d \\) is the distance over which the object has traveled.\n\nThe equation assumes that the initial velocity (\\( v_i \\)) is zero, which simplifies the standard kinematic formula:\n\n\\[ v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2 \\cdot a \\cdot d \\]\n\nIn scenarios where the initial velocity is zero, this equation reduces to the one provided above.\n\n**Edge Cases and Assumptions:**\n- **Zero or Negative Acceleration:** If the acceleration is zero, the final velocity remains zero since the object does not speed up.

This step is crucial for ensuring that the answer is in a format that can be further validated.\n\nThe function then proceeds to check the validity of the parsed answer. This involves assessing whether the information provided is accurate, relevant, and complete according to the context or requirements set for the task. Validity checks may include verifying the presence of key information, ensuring logical consistency, and confirming that the answer addresses the original query effectively.\n\nA special case arises when the LLM outputs the specific phrase 'answer not found'. This is a predefined response indicating that the LLM was unable to generate a suitable answer based on the input it received. In such cases, the function is designed to handle this scenario by returning an empty string. This behavior serves as a clear indication that no valid answer was produced by the LLM, allowing the calling process to recognize and handle this outcome appropriately.\n\nOverall, the function plays a vital role in ensuring the quality and reliability of responses generated by the LLM, making it an essential component in applications where accurate information retrieval is critical.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["answer"], "properties": {"answer": {"type": "string", "description": "The text response from the LLM in plain text.

This calculation takes into account three crucial parameters: the mass of the substance, the temperature at which the phase transition occurs (often referred to as the phase transition temperature), and the specific latent heat of the substance for the particular phase change being considered.\n\nThe mass of the substance is a measure of how much of the material is undergoing the phase change, typically expressed in kilograms (kg). The phase transition temperature is the specific temperature at which the substance changes from one phase to another, such as from solid to liquid or liquid to gas. This temperature is characteristic of each substance and phase transition, and it remains constant during the phase change process under constant pressure conditions. The specific latent heat, usually given in joules per kilogram (J/kg), is the amount of energy required to change the phase of one kilogram of the substance without changing its temperature.\n\nBy multiplying the mass of the substance by the specific latent heat, the function calculates the total energy involved in the phase change. This energy can be positive, indicating that energy is absorbed to facilitate the phase transition (such as melting or vaporization), or negative, indicating that energy is released during the transition (such as freezing or condensation).\n\nAn example usage of the function might involve calculating the energy required to melt a block of ice. Suppose you have 2 kilograms of ice at its melting point (0\u00b0C) and you know the specific latent heat of fusion for ice is 334,000 J/kg.

Similarly, if the process were instead freezing water into ice, this same amount of energy would be released.\n\nThis function is particularly useful in thermodynamic calculations where understanding energy transfers during phase transitions is crucial.

It operates under the assumption that these two physiological metrics can provide significant insights into a person's health profile, particularly in relation to their risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **weight (float or int):** This parameter represents the individual's weight, typically measured in kilograms or pounds. Accurate weight measurement is crucial as it directly influences the calculation of body mass index (BMI), which is a commonly used proxy for assessing overweight and obesity levels. These levels are known risk factors for type 2 diabetes.\n\n- **height (float or int):** This parameter denotes the individual's height, usually recorded in meters or inches. Height is another essential component for calculating BMI. Accurate height measurement ensures the correct interpretation of BMI, which is vital for the assessment of diabetes risk.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\nThe function processes the input values to calculate the individual's BMI, which is a widely recognized metric for evaluating body fat. The BMI is computed using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{BMI} = \\frac{\\text{weight in kilograms}}{(\\text{height in meters})^2} \\]\n\nor\n\n\\[ \\text{BMI} = \\frac{\\text{weight in pounds}}{(\\text{height in inches})^2} \\times 703 \\]\n\nOnce the BMI is calculated, the function uses this value as a core determinant to predict the probability of type 2 diabetes. The function may implement predictive algorithms or reference medical data that correlate BMI ranges with diabetes risk levels.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n1. **Unrealistic Weight or Height Values:** If the provided weight or height is zero or negative, the function should handle these cases gracefully, possibly by returning an error message or requesting valid inputs.\n\n2. **Extremely High or Low BMI:** For individuals with very high or very", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"weight": {"type": "integer", "description": "Weight of the person in lbs."}, "height": {"type": "integer", "description": "Height of the person in inches."}, "activity_level": {"type": "string", "enum": ["sedentary", "lightly active", "moderately active", "very active", "extra active"], "description": "Physical activity level of the person."}}, "required": ["weight", "height", "activity_level"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\nTo predict the likelihood of type 2 diabetes for the given person, I will use the `diabetes_prediction1` function with the provided parameters: weight, height, and activity level.\n\n[diabetes_prediction1(weight=150, height=70, activity_level='lightly active')]", "possible_answer": [{"diabetes_prediction1": {"weight": [150], "height": [70], "activity_level": ["lightly active"]}}, {"diabetes_prediction2": {"weight": [150], "height": [70], "activity_level": ["lightly active"]}}, {"diabetes_prediction3": {"weight": [150], "height": [70], "activity_level": ["lightly active"]}}]}

It serves as a useful tool for individuals or organizations aiming to understand and possibly reduce their carbon footprint by providing insights into how much a particular vehicle contributes to overall emissions over the course of a year.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **Vehicle Type**: This parameter specifies the type of vehicle for which the emissions will be calculated. Each vehicle type is associated with a unique emission factor, which represents the amount of carbon dioxide emitted per mile traveled. Common vehicle types might include compact cars, SUVs, trucks, and electric vehicles. It is crucial that the correct vehicle type is selected to ensure an accurate calculation.\n\n- **Annual Mileage**: This parameter represents the total number of miles driven by the vehicle in one year. It is a key input for the calculation, as it directly correlates with the total emissions. Annual mileage can vary widely based on individual usage patterns, such as daily commuting, long-distance travel, or occasional use.\n\n#### Calculation:\n\nThe function uses the following formula to determine the annual carbon emissions:\n\n\\[ \\text{Annual Carbon Emissions (tons)} = \\text{Emission Factor (kg/mile)} \\times \\text{Annual Mileage (miles)} \\times 0.001 \\]\n\nWhere:\n- **Emission Factor** is specific to the vehicle type and accounts for the carbon dioxide output per mile.\n- The factor \\(0.001\\) is used to convert kilograms to metric tons, providing a standardized unit for emissions.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n1. **Zero Mileage**: If the annual mileage is set to zero, the function should return zero emissions, as no distance has been traveled by the vehicle, resulting in no carbon output.\n\n2. **Invalid Vehicle Type**: When an incorrect or unsupported vehicle type is provided, the function should handle the error gracefully, either by returning an error message", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"vehicle_type": {"type": "string", "description": "The type of vehicle.

Returns a list of times in seconds, each representing the occurrence of a significant beat within the audio file.The function is designed to process and analyze an input audio file with the objective of identifying distinct beats within the audio signal. It employs algorithms to detect beats, which are significant rhythmic events in the audio, by examining the waveform and other audio features. Once the beats have been identified, the function applies a filtering mechanism to ensure the reliability of the results. This filtering process is based on two main criteria: confidence levels and timing.\n\nThe confidence level refers to the certainty or reliability that the detected beat corresponds to an actual rhythmic event. Only beats that meet or exceed a predefined confidence threshold are considered significant and retained in the final output. This ensures that the beats included in the output list are not only detectable but also likely to be perceived as significant rhythmic components by listeners.\n\nThe timing consideration involves assessing the temporal placement of each beat within the audio file.

By filtering based on timing, the function eliminates any beats that might be detected too closely together or at irregular intervals, which might not reflect the intended rhythm of the audio.\n\nUpon completion of the analysis and filtering processes, the function returns a list.

This could involve inputting the species' scientific name or a unique identifier used within a biological database.

This input is crucial as the rate of evolution can vary significantly over different timescales, influenced by both short-term adaptations and long-term evolutionary trends.\n\nIn predicting the evolutionary rate, the function may employ various computational models and algorithms that simulate evolutionary processes. These models might incorporate data from genetic sequences, fossil records, and other biological datasets. The output of the function is a quantitative measure of the evolutionary rate, typically expressed in terms of genetic change per unit of time.\n\nEdge cases might include species with limited available data, which could result in less accurate predictions.

This calculation is crucial for applications that involve clock face simulations, time visualization tools, or any scenario where the spatial relationship between the clock hands needs to be understood.\n\nTo achieve this, the function first calculates the positions of the hour and minute hands in terms of degrees. The clock face is divided into 360 degrees, with each hour marking a 30-degree segment since there are 12 hours on a clock (360 degrees / 12 hours = 30 degrees per hour). Similarly, each minute represents a 6-degree movement from the 12 o'clock position (360 degrees / 60 minutes = 6 degrees per minute).\n\nFor the hour hand, its position is determined not only by the hour itself but also by how far it has moved towards the next hour based on the current minute. This is calculated by:\n\n- Hour angle = (Hour % 12) * 30 + (Minutes / 60) * 30\n\nThis formula considers the hour hand's movement as it transitions smoothly between the numbered hour marks.\n\nFor the minute hand, the position is straightforward:\n\n- Minute angle = Minutes * 6\n\nOnce both angles are calculated, the function finds the absolute difference between the two angles to determine the angle between the hour and minute hands.

Light, the fastest known entity in the universe, travels at approximately 299,792 kilometers per second in a vacuum. The function leverages this constant speed of light to determine the time interval required for light to traverse the distance separating the two specified celestial bodies.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **distance (float)**: This parameter represents the distance between the two celestial bodies, expressed in kilometers. It is crucial that the distance provided is accurate to ensure the precision of the calculated time. The function assumes that the entire distance is a straight line in a vacuum, as light speed can be affected by varying mediums.\n\n2. **speed_of_light (constant)**: The speed of light is a fundamental constant used in the calculation. Although this value is fixed at approximately 299,792 kilometers per second, it is implicitly considered in the calculation and does not need to be provided as an argument by the user. \n\n#### Returns:\n\n- **time (float)**: The function returns the time taken for light to travel the specified distance. The returned value is presented in seconds, providing a clear measurement of the time lapse due to the immense speed of light.\n\n#### Edge Cases and Considerations:\n\n- **Zero Distance**: If the distance between the two celestial bodies is zero, the function should return a time of zero seconds, indicating that no travel is necessary.\n- **Negative Distance**: Theoretically, a negative distance does not have a physical meaning in this context. The function should handle such inputs by either returning an error or processing it as an invalid request.\n- **Extremely Large Distances**: For astronomical distances, the function should maintain precision and accuracy, considering the vast scales involved in space. The result may require significant digits to accurately reflect the time taken.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\n```python\n# Example call to calculate light travel time\ndistance_between", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"distance_in_light_years": {"type": "integer", "description": "The distance between the two celestial bodies in light years."}, "speed_of_light": {"type": "integer", "description": "The speed of light in vacuum, in m/s.

For numbers, it returns the negative value.This function is designed to reverse or invert various types of input data, returning a transformed output based on the input's data type. The function can handle strings, booleans, and numbers, each with a specific inversion operation:\n\n1. **String Reversal**: When the input is a string, the function processes the string by reversing the sequence of its characters. For example, if the input string is \"hello\", the function returns \"olleh\". This operation ensures that the order of the characters is completely flipped from the end to the beginning, resulting in a mirror image of the original string.\n\n2. **Boolean Negation**: If the input is a boolean value, the function performs a logical negation. This means that if the input is `True`, the function returns `False`, and if the input is `False`, it returns `True`.

For instance, if the input is a positive number like `25`, the function returns `-25`. Conversely, if the input is already negative, such as `-13`, the function will return `13`.

The t-test will analyze these arrays to calculate the t-statistic, which is a ratio of the difference between the sample means and the variability of the samples. \n\nThe function assumes that the data in the arrays are normally distributed and that the variances of the two groups are equal, which is a common assumption in t-tests.

This calculation is crucial for assessing the profitability of an investment or project. The NPV function evaluates the present value of a series of cash flows that occur at regular intervals, such as annually, quarterly, or monthly. These cash flows can include both inflows (positive values) and outflows (negative values), representing income and expenses, respectively.\n\nThe core principle of NPV involves discounting future cash flows back to their present value using the provided discount rate. This rate reflects the opportunity cost of capital, or the return that could be earned on an alternative investment of equivalent risk. Therefore, it's essential to choose an appropriate rate that accurately reflects the investment's risk profile.\n\nKey parameters of the function include:\n- A list or array of cash flows: This parameter contains the sequence of cash flows occurring at each period. The cash flows should be ordered chronologically, starting from the initial investment or cash outlay, often represented as a negative value.\n- The discount rate: This is the rate used to discount future cash flows back to their present value. It is expressed as a decimal, so a 5% discount rate would be input as 0.05.\n\nTo compute the NPV, the function will iterate through each cash flow, applying the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{NPV} = \\sum_{t=0}^{n} \\frac{C_t}{(1 + r)^t} \\]\n\nwhere \\( C_t \\) represents the cash flow at time \\( t \\), \\( r \\) is the discount rate, and \\( n \\) is the total number of periods.\n\nIt's important to note that the initial cash flow (often the investment cost) is typically included in the series, and it influences the NPV result.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.This function is designed specifically to execute system-level commands through the `os.system()` method available in Python, and it is tailored for use on Windows operating systems. The `os.system()` function is a simple way to run commands as if they were being executed directly in the command line interface or Command Prompt on a Windows machine. One of the key features of this functionality is its capability to handle not only individual commands but also to execute multiple commands that are linked or chained together using the `&&` operator. This operator serves as a conditional execution mechanism: if the command preceding the `&&` operator completes successfully, the subsequent command will be executed. This allows the user to create a sequence of commands that depend on the successful execution of the previous ones, effectively enabling more complex operations to be performed in a single call to the function. \n\nFor instance, if a user wishes to navigate to a specific directory and then list its contents, they might chain these commands as follows: `cd my_directory && dir`. In this example, if the change directory command (`cd my_directory`) runs successfully, the directory listing command (`dir`) will then execute. Such chaining allows for efficient command execution without the need for multiple separate function calls.\n\nIt is important to note that while `os.system()` is straightforward to use, any output generated by the executed command will be sent directly to the standard output stream, typically the console. Additionally, the function returns the exit status of the command run, where a value of `0` generally indicates successful execution, and any non-zero value indicates an error or abnormal termination. Furthermore, the `os.system()` method does not capture the output of the command; if capturing the output is necessary, alternative methods such as `subprocess.run()` should be considered.

It provides the capability to run a single command or multiple commands that are chained together using the '&&' operator, which is a common practice in command-line operations to ensure that subsequent commands are only executed if the previous one completes successfully. \n\nThe `os.system()` function takes a single string argument, which should contain the command or set of commands you wish to execute.

For example, you might want to perform file operations, launch applications, or run scripts from the command line.\n\nWhen using this function to execute multiple commands chained with '&&', each command must be separated by this operator within the string. The '&&' operator ensures that each command is executed sequentially, with the next command only running if the previous command finishes with a success (exit status 0).

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that taskkill is a command-line tool used to terminate processes. But to use it, I need to know the process ID. Since the user mentioned they've set the timer earlier, I can assume the process is running and has a unique PID.\n\nI remember that the taskkill command can take a PID as an argument. So, the basic structure would be something like taskkill /PID:PIDNumber. But I don't know the PID off the top of my head, so I need a way to find it.\n\nOne method is to open the Task Manager. I can do this by pressing Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager. Once there, I can search for \"timer.exe\" to find its PID. Alternatively, the user might already know the PID, but it's safer to include both options in the function call.\n\nOnce I have the PID, I can structure the command. If the user knows the PID, I can directly use it. If not, I can include a search for the process name. However, since the function call can only have a single command, I might need to handle both scenarios within the same function.\n\nWait, but the function can only execute one command at a time. So, perhaps I should suggest two separate function calls: one to find the PID and another to execute taskkill with that PID. Alternatively, I can combine both into a single command if possible.\n\nBut looking at the available functions, cmd_controller.execute1 is the only one that can be used, and it's designed for executing system commands. So, I can structure the function call to first find the PID using taskkill with a search string, but taskkill doesn't support search strings in the same way as other commands. Alternatively, I can use a different approach.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the 'where' command in Task Manager to get the PID. But since the function can't execute multiple commands in one call, I might need to make two separate function calls: one to get the PID and another to execute taskkill.\n\nBut the user's question is to remove timer.exe using taskkill. So, perhaps the best approach is to first find the PID and then use it in the taskkill command. However, since the function can only handle one command, I might need to structure it as two separate function calls.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a different approach. Maybe using the 'tasklist' command to get the PID. For example, 'tasklist /search=\"timer.exe\"' would list all processes named timer.exe, and the first one would have the PID. But again, this would require two function calls.\n\nWait, but the function can only execute one command. So, perhaps the user needs to perform two separate function calls: one to find the PID and another to execute taskkill. But the user might not want to do that, so maybe I should suggest both options.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a different function or method, but since the available functions are limited, I have to work with what's given.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Use cmd_controller.execute1 to run a command that finds the PID of timer.exe. For example, using 'tasklist /search=\"timer.exe\" | find /v /exactmatch processname' to get the PID.\n\n2. Once the PID is obtained, use cmd_controller.execute1 again to run 'taskkill /PID:PIDNumber'.\n\nBut since the user might not know the PID, the first function call is necessary. However, if the user knows the PID, they can skip the first step.\n\nAlternatively, I can suggest a single function call that tries to find the PID and then execute taskkill, but I'm not sure if that's possible with the given functions.\n\nWait, perhaps I can combine both into a single command. For example, using 'taskkill /PID:(PID from tasklist \"timer.exe\")'. But that would require knowing the PID, which I don't.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a different approach. Maybe using 'where processname' in Task Manager, but that's more of a GUI tool, not a command-line command.\n\nHmm, perhaps the best way is to suggest two separate function calls: one to find the PID and another to execute taskkill.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'The function provided is designed to execute system-level commands by utilizing the `os.system()` function from the Python standard library, specifically tailored for use on Windows operating systems. This functionality is pivotal when you require your Python script to interact directly with the operating system's command line interface. The `os.system()` call allows a Python script to execute a command as if it were typed directly into the Command Prompt.\n\nFor executing the command, you simply need to pass the desired system command as a string argument to the `os.system()` function. This can include a single command or multiple commands that are chained together using the '&&' operator. The '&&' operator ensures that commands are executed sequentially, where the subsequent command will only run if the previous one completes successfully (i.e., returns a zero exit status). This is particularly useful for executing a series of dependent commands where the successful execution of the first command is necessary for the execution of the next.\n\nFor example, to execute a single command, you might use:\n```python\nos.system('dir')\n```\nThis would invoke the `dir` command, listing the contents of the current directory in the Command Prompt.\n\nTo execute multiple commands, you could use:\n```python\nos.system('cd \\\\ && mkdir new_folder')\n```\nIn this example, the script first navigates to the root directory using `cd \\\\` and then creates a new folder named `new_folder` using `mkdir new_folder`. If the first command fails, the second command will not execute, thanks to the '&&' chaining.\n\nThis function is limited to the Windows operating system and relies on the capabilities and available commands of the Windows Command Prompt environment. It's important to note that while `os.system()` is a straightforward way to invoke system commands from within a Python script, it does not provide access to more advanced features such as capturing the output of the command.

It is a crucial input as it determines the base amount on which returns will be calculated.\n\n- **Annual Yield Rate**: This is the rate at which the investment grows annually.

The annual yield rate is assumed to be compounded annually, meaning that the investment grows by this percentage each year.\n\n- **Time Period**: The time period, often expressed in years, is the duration for which the investment is held. It determines how long the initial investment and its returns will continue to grow at the specified annual yield rate.\n\nThe function applies the formula for compound interest to compute the final balance of the investment.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.This function is designed to execute system-level commands specifically on Windows operating systems by utilizing the `os.system()` method from Python's `os` module. The `os.system()` function is a straightforward way to run a command as if it were being executed from the Windows command prompt or console. It is important to note that this function is particularly useful for running commands that are native to the Windows operating system, taking advantage of its command-line interface.\n\nThe function can handle and execute both single commands and multiple commands that are chained together. Chaining commands is achieved using the '&&' operator, which allows for sequential execution. When commands are chained with '&&', each command is executed in the order they are specified, and the next command is executed only if the previous command succeeds. This can be particularly useful for performing a series of dependent operations, ensuring that each command in the chain only runs if the preceding command succeeds without errors.\n\nFor example, if you want to navigate to a directory and then list its contents, you could use the following chained command: `\"cd C:\\\\example_directory && dir\"`. In this example, the function will first attempt to change the directory to `C:\\example_directory`. If successful, it will then execute the `dir` command to list the contents of that directory. If the `cd` command fails, for instance, if the directory does not exist, the `dir` command will not be executed.\n\nIt should be noted that this function is synchronous, meaning it will block the execution of further Python code until the system command has completed. Additionally, the return value of `os.system()` represents the exit status of the command executed, with a return value of `0` typically indicating success, and any non-zero value indicating an error occurred. This can be used to handle errors gracefully in the implementation of the function.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

For multiple commands, separate them with '&&'. For complex tasks, create and run a .bat file.The function is designed to execute a specified command on a Windows operating system environment using the `os.system()` function from Python's `os` module. This function is particularly tailored for scenarios where you need to run shell commands directly from a Python script. \n\nWhen using this function to execute multiple commands in sequence, you should separate each command with the '&&' operator. This ensures that commands are executed one after the other in the specified order, and execution will stop if any command fails. This chaining is particularly useful for tasks that depend on the successful completion of previous commands.\n\nHowever, if the sequence of commands is complex or involves intricate logic, it is recommended to encapsulate the logic within a batch file\u2014commonly known as a `.bat` file on Windows systems. This approach simplifies the command execution process by allowing you to write and organize your commands, loops, and other control statements within the file. You can then execute this batch file using the `os.system()` function, which passes the command to the Windows command line interpreter (`cmd.exe`).\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how to use the function:\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Single command execution\nos.system('dir')\n\n# Multiple command execution\nos.system('cd C:\\\\ && dir')\n\n# Executing a batch file\nos.system('C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\your\\\\script.bat')\n```\n\nIn these examples, `os.system('dir')` will list the contents of the current directory. When executing multiple commands, `os.system('cd C:\\\\ && dir')` will change the directory to the root of the C drive and then list its contents. For more advanced operations, such as setting environment variables or looping through commands, consider creating a batch file and running it through `os.system('C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\your\\\\script.bat')`. \n\nBe aware that the `os.system()` function returns a system-dependent status code, which can be used to determine the success or failure of the", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The Windows command line instruction(s) to be executed.

The retrieval process is performed based on two primary criteria: the service type and the location, specifically within a designated province.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **Service Type:** \n   - This parameter specifies the category or classification of the service you are attempting to identify. \n   - It is important that the service type is accurately provided, as it directly influences the identification process.\n   - Examples of service types could include utilities, healthcare, education, transportation, etc.\n\n2. **Location (Province):**\n   - The location parameter refers to the specific geographical area where the service is offered, limited to a province level.\n   - The province acts as a boundary for the search, ensuring that the function narrows down the identifier to services available within the specified province.\n   - This is particularly relevant in regions where administrative divisions significantly influence service delivery.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- If the service type provided does not exist within the specified province, the function should be designed to handle such scenarios gracefully, possibly by returning a null or error message indicating that no matching service was found.\n- In cases where multiple services of the same type exist within the province, additional logic may be required to ensure the correct unique identifier is retrieved. This could involve prioritizing services based on additional criteria not covered by this function.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nImagine a scenario where you need to retrieve the unique identifier for a healthcare service in the province of Alberta. By specifying the service type as \"healthcare\" and the location as \"Alberta,\" the function will search through the available records and return the unique identifier for the healthcare service specifically associated with that province. This identifier can then be used for further operations such as updating service details, tracking usage, or integrating with other provincial databases.\n\nIn summary, this function plays a critical role in", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["service_id"], "properties": {"service_id": {"type": "integer", "description": "The unique identifier of the service.

The calculation is based on three critical parameters: the distance traveled by the vehicle over the course of a year, the type of fuel used by the vehicle, and the vehicle's fuel efficiency. \n\n1. **Distance Traveled:** This parameter represents the total distance that the vehicle covers in a year, typically measured in kilometers or miles. It is an essential factor because the amount of CO2 emissions is directly proportional to how far the vehicle travels. The greater the distance, the more emissions are expected, provided other factors remain constant.\n\n2. **Fuel Type:** This refers to the kind of fuel the vehicle uses, such as gasoline, diesel, or alternative fuels like ethanol or natural gas. Each fuel type has a specific carbon content, and the emissions calculation will vary depending on the carbon intensity associated with the combustion of that particular fuel. For instance, gasoline and diesel have different emission factors, affecting the total CO2 emissions calculated.\n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency:** This parameter indicates how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel to travel a given distance, typically stated in terms of liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km) or miles per gallon (mpg). Higher fuel efficiency means that the vehicle consumes less fuel for the same distance, resulting in lower CO2 emissions. Conversely, lower efficiency leads to higher emissions.\n\nThe function combines these parameters to estimate the total CO2 emissions for the year. It considers how the interplay between the distance traveled, the fuel type used, and the vehicle's fuel efficiency impacts the overall emissions output. For instance, even if a vehicle travels a substantial distance, if it uses a fuel with a low carbon content or has high fuel efficiency, the emissions might remain relatively low. Conversely, a vehicle with poor fuel efficiency using a high-carbon fuel type will likely produce higher emissions over the same distance.\n\nIn summary, this function provides a crucial environmental metric by allowing individuals, organizations,", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"distance": {"type": "integer", "description": "The distance travelled in miles."}, "fuel_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of fuel used by the vehicle."}, "fuel_efficiency": {"type": "float", "description": "The vehicle's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon."}, "efficiency_reduction": {"type": "integer", "description": "The percentage decrease in fuel efficiency per year (optional).

For instance, if a user is looking for a library that offers a collection of English fiction books, the function will focus on libraries with this particular category available. Similarly, if having Wi-Fi access is crucial for the user's needs, the function will prioritize libraries that provide Wi-Fi service to patrons.\n\nIn addition to the primary criteria of English fiction and Wi-Fi, users may specify other parameters as needed, provided they adhere to the function's input requirements. The function is particularly useful for individuals seeking specific resources or facilities offered by public libraries without needing to manually check each library's offerings. This efficiency aids in saving time and ensuring that users can easily access the resources they require.\n\nExamples of usage may include a user wanting to study in a library that offers internet access or a reader searching for a new English fiction novel to enjoy. By inputting their preferences, the function will streamline their search, making it a convenient tool for library users with specific needs. Edge cases might involve scenarios where no libraries meet all specified criteria, prompting the function to either expand the search parameters or notify the user accordingly.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"location": {"type": "string", "description": "The city and state, e.g. Boston, MA"}, "facilities": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["Wi-Fi", "Reading Room", "Fiction", "Children Section", "Cafe"]}, "description": "Facilities and sections in public library."}}, "required": ["location", "facilities"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\npublic_library.find_nearby1({'location': 'Boston, MA', 'facilities': ['Wi-Fi', 'Fiction']})", "model_result_decoded": [{"public_library.find_nearby1": {}}], "possible_answer": [{"public_library.find_nearby1": {"location": ["Boston, MA", "Boston, Massachusetts"], "facilities": [["Fiction", "Wi-Fi"], ["Wi-Fi", "Fiction"]]}}, {"public_library.find_nearby2": {"location": ["Boston, MA", "Boston, Massachusetts"], "facilities": [["Fiction", "Wi-Fi"], ["Wi-Fi", "Fiction"]]}}, {"public_library.find_nearby3": {"location": ["Boston, MA", "Boston, Massachusetts"], "facilities": [["Fiction", "Wi-Fi"], ["Wi-Fi", "Fiction"]]}}]}

It operates by filtering movies based on a combination of three key attributes: the director, the genre, and the cast.\n\nFirstly, the user specifies the director whose movies they are interested in. The function then searches through a database or dataset to identify all movies associated with that director. This means that if a director has multiple entries or aliases, the function should account for these to ensure accurate retrieval.\n\nSecondly, the user provides a genre, which serves as another filter in the search process. The function cross-references the genre specified with the genres tagged to each movie in the dataset. This ensures that only the movies fitting the specified genre criteria are included in the results.\n\nFinally, the function considers the cast specified by the user. The user can provide names of actors or actresses, and the function will search for movies that include these cast members. It is important that the function handles cases where a cast member might have multiple roles or pseudonyms, ensuring that all relevant movies are captured.\n\nThe function combines these three elements\u2014director, genre, and cast\u2014to produce a final list of movies that match all the user's specified criteria. It returns this list in a format that is convenient for further analysis or consumption by other parts of the application or system.\n\nIt is crucial for the user to understand that the function's ability to retrieve movies is contingent upon the accuracy and completeness of the data available in the database. If the database lacks information on certain movies or has incorrect details about directors, genres, or cast members, the results may be incomplete or inaccurate. Additionally, in cases where the user provides conflicting criteria (e.g., a director not associated with a specified genre), the function might return an empty list, indicating no matches were found.\n\nFor effective use, the user is advised to ensure that the criteria provided are as specific and accurate as possible.

Higher input or weight increases firing rate and higher decay rate decreases it.The function is designed to calculate the neuronal activity, specifically the rate of firing, by taking into account three critical parameters: the given input synaptic rate, the weight of the inputs, and the decay rate. The input synaptic rate represents the frequency or intensity of incoming signals that the neuron receives. It is a significant factor because a higher synaptic rate typically leads to increased neuronal activity. The weight of inputs is another essential factor that influences the firing rate. It refers to the strength or potency of the synaptic connections. When the weights are higher, the impact of the input signals on the neuron is amplified, resulting in an elevated rate of firing. Conversely, the decay rate serves as a counterbalancing factor. It represents the rate at which the neuronal activity diminishes or subsides over time. A higher decay rate implies a quicker reduction in firing activity, thereby decreasing the overall firing rate. Therefore, the computation of the neuronal activity is a dynamic interplay of these parameters, where increases in either the input synaptic rate or the weight of inputs lead to a higher firing rate, while an increase in the decay rate has the opposite effect by decreasing the firing rate. This function allows for a nuanced understanding of how various factors contribute to neuronal firing, making it a valuable tool in the study of neural dynamics.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"input_synaptic_rate": {"type": "integer", "description": "The synaptic input rate, usually represented as number of inputs per second."}, "weight": {"type": "float", "description": "The weight of the input, denoting its influence on the neuron's state.

Users can employ this function to gain insights into the origins of various inventions by simply inputting the name of the desired invention.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **invention_name (str):** This is a string input representing the name of the invention for which information is being requested. It is crucial that the invention name is spelled correctly and matches the records within the data source being queried, to ensure accurate retrieval of information.\n\n#### Returns:\n- **inventor_name (str):** A string output containing the name of the inventor who is credited with creating the specified invention. This will provide users with a clear identification of the individual or group responsible for the innovation.\n- **year_of_invention (int):** An integer output that represents the calendar year when the invention was officially recorded or recognized. This allows users to understand the historical context of the invention.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nAssume you are interested in retrieving information about an invention called \"Telephone.\" You would call the function with the name \"Telephone\" as the argument. Upon executing the function, it would return \"Alexander Graham Bell\" as the inventor's name and \"1876\" as the year of invention.\n\n#### Edge Cases and Considerations:\n- If the invention name provided does not match any records in the dataset or database, the function may return a predefined response indicating that no information is available. This could be a `None` value or a specific error message.\n- In cases where multiple inventors are associated with the invention, the function might return a list of names or a string listing all inventors involved.\n- It is also possible that some inventions do not have a precise year of invention due to historical ambiguities", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"invention_name": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the invention."}, "want_year": {"type": "boolean", "default": false, "description": "Return the year of invention if set to true."}}, "required": ["invention_name", "want_year"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "\n\nTo determine who invented the theory of relativity and the year, we can use the `science_history.get_invention1` function.

It begins by taking a complete deck consisting of the four traditional suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades, each containing thirteen cards ranging from Ace through King. The deck, therefore, contains 52 unique cards in total.\n\nThe primary operation performed by this function is shuffling, which randomizes the order of the cards within the deck to ensure a fair draw. This step is crucial for any applications where unpredictability and randomness are desired, such as in card games or simulations.\n\nOnce the deck is sufficiently shuffled, the function proceeds to draw cards. The number of cards to be drawn is specified as an input parameter. For example, if the parameter value is set to 5, the function will draw the top five cards from the shuffled deck. This parameter allows flexibility in usage, accommodating varying requirements for different card games or experiments. \n\nIt's important to note that the function assumes the number of cards requested does not exceed the total number of cards in the deck.

A full house is a hand that contains three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank, such as three queens and two eights. In a standard deck of 52 playing cards, this is considered one of the stronger hands a player can have.\n\n#### Features and Details:\n\n- **Input Parameters:** The function typically does not require input parameters, as it operates on the assumption of a standard 52-card deck used in typical poker games.\n  \n- **Output:** The output is a numerical probability value, representing the likelihood of being dealt a full house. This value ranges between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating certainty. The probability is calculated by considering all possible five-card combinations that form a full house and dividing by the total number of possible five-card hands.\n\n- **Calculation Methodology:** \n  - The method involves combinatorial mathematics to determine the number of successful outcomes (i.e., the number of ways to form a full house) divided by the total number of possible five-card hands from a deck. \n  - Specifically, it calculates the combinations of choosing three cards of the same rank from four available in the deck, and two cards of another rank from the remaining four cards of that rank.\n\n- **Edge Cases:** \n  - The function assumes a perfect shuffle and no prior card removal, reflecting a fresh and complete deck.\n  - It does not account for multiple decks or jokers, as it is based on the standard poker rules using a single deck.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nThe function can be used in poker simulation games, strategy analysis, or as part of a larger poker hand evaluation library. For instance:\n\n```python\nprobability = calculate_full_house_probability()\nprint(f\"The probability of being dealt a full house is: {probability:.6f}\")\n```\n\nIn this example, calling the function", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"deck_size": {"type": "integer", "description": "The size of the deck.

By inputting the desired cooking time, the function will search through a database or collection of vegan soup recipes to find one that can be completed within the given timeframe. This ensures convenience and speed in meal preparation, allowing users to plan their cooking activities effectively based on their schedule constraints.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **cooking_time (int)**: This parameter accepts an integer value representing the total time available for cooking the soup, measured in minutes. It is important to ensure that the value passed is a positive integer to avoid errors. The function will utilize this parameter to filter and select an appropriate recipe that fits within the specified duration.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\nUpon receiving the cooking time parameter, the function performs a search operation across a predefined set of vegan soup recipes, each tagged with an estimated preparation and cooking duration. The function then identifies recipes where the total required time does not exceed the provided cooking time. These recipes typically include a list of ingredients and step-by-step instructions to guide the user through the preparation process.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- If no recipes can be found that match the specified cooking time, the function may return a message indicating that no suitable recipes are available. This outcome prompts the user to either increase the cooking time or adjust their preferences.\n  \n- If the cooking time is extremely short (e.g., a few minutes), the function might only return very simple recipes, such as those that require minimal preparation and involve mostly pre-cooked or quick-cooking ingredients.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nImagine a user who has just one hour to prepare dinner and enjoys vegan cuisine.

The input must correspond to a valid time zone identifier based on the IANA time zone database. Examples include \"America/New_York\", \"Europe/London\", or \"Asia/Tokyo\". It is important to ensure the correctness of this parameter as invalid inputs may lead to errors or exceptions being raised.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\nUpon receiving a valid time zone identifier, the function performs the following actions:\n\n1. Validates the provided time zone to ensure it matches an entry in the IANA time zone database.\n2. Retrieves the current time from the system clock or an external time service.\n3. Adjusts the retrieved time according to the rules of the specified time zone, taking into account any applicable daylight saving time adjustments or historical changes to time zone definitions.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Invalid Time Zone**: If an invalid or unrecognized time zone identifier is provided, the function may throw an exception or return an error message indicating the issue. The user should handle such cases to ensure smooth functionality.\n- **Daylight Saving Time**: The function considers daylight saving time transitions automatically, ensuring that the returned time is accurate even during these periods.\n- **Time Zone Changes**: Any changes to time zone definitions, such as shifts in borders or policy changes by governments, are automatically handled based on the latest IANA time zone database updates.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\n```python\n# Example usage in Python\ncurrent_time = get_current_time_in_timezone(\"America", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"location": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the city."}, "country": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the country."}, "timezone": {"type": "string", "description": "The optional timezone to get current time.
