When invoking this function, it is crucial to provide the name of the city accurately, as this will ensure that the weather data returned is specific to the desired location. Additionally, when specifying the state, it is important to utilize the standardized two-letter postal abbreviation, such as 'CA' for California, 'TX' for Texas, or 'NY' for New York, instead of the full state name. This requirement helps to prevent any potential ambiguities or errors in the data retrieval process, as many cities share the same name across different states. \n\nAn edge case to consider when using this function is ensuring that the city name does not include any typographical errors, as this could lead to the retrieval of incorrect weather information or an inability to find any data at all. Moreover, the function may not support international city names; hence, it is explicitly indicated for use with U.S. cities and states only. \n\nTo demonstrate the proper usage of this function, consider the following example: to retrieve the weather conditions for San Francisco, California, you would call the function with 'San Francisco' as the city parameter and 'CA' as the state parameter.

It prepares data for machine learning models, ensuring numerical values are scaled properly and categorical variables are appropriately transformed.This function serves as a crucial preprocessing step in the pipeline of preparing data for machine learning models. The primary objective of this function is to transform raw input data into a format that can be effectively used by various machine learning algorithms. It achieves this by performing two key operations: normalization of numerical values and encoding of categorical variables.\n\nThe normalization process involves adjusting the scale of numerical features to ensure that they contribute equally to the model's performance. This is particularly important in cases where the numerical features have varying units or magnitudes. By bringing all numerical values to a consistent scale, often within a range such as [0, 1] or having a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, the function helps prevent any single feature from disproportionately influencing the model due to its scale.\n\nIn addition to normalization, this function also addresses categorical variables, which are non-numeric data types that represent categories or labels. Such variables need to be converted into a numerical form before being fed into machine learning models, as these models typically require numerical input. The function accomplishes this transformation through encoding techniques, such as one-hot encoding or label encoding. One-hot encoding transforms each categorical variable into a binary vector, ensuring that the model can understand and process these variables without assuming any inherent order or relationship. Label encoding assigns a unique integer to each category, which can be useful for certain algorithms that can handle ordinal relationships.\n\nBy performing normalization and encoding, the function ensures that the input data is in an optimal condition for training machine learning models, facilitating better performance and accuracy. This preprocessing step is essential for any data pipeline aiming to extract meaningful insights and predictions from data with diverse characteristics.\n\nExample usage:\nSuppose you have a dataset containing both numerical features, such as age and salary, and categorical features, like country or department.

The function assumes that these complexities are handled internally by retrieving the correct tax rate for the specified jurisdiction. \n\nWhen using this function, ensure that the purchase amount is a numerical value and that the jurisdiction is specified correctly according to the system or database being used to determine tax rates. Edge cases might include jurisdictions with no sales tax or those with special tax holidays, where the sales tax might be temporarily reduced or waived. \n\nAn example usage of this function might involve a purchase amount of $100 in a jurisdiction with a 5% sales tax. The function would calculate 5% of $100, which is $5, and add it to the original amount, resulting in a total amount of $105.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["purchase_amount", "state"], "properties": {"purchase_amount": {"type": "float", "description": "The total purchase amount in dollars."}, "state": {"type": "string", "description": "The U.S. state abbreviation where the purchase is made, such as 'CA' for California or 'NY' for New York."}, "county": {"type": "string", "description": "The county within the state where the purchase is made.

Examples of classifications might include 'Billing Issue,' 'Technical Support,' 'Product Inquiry,' or 'Feedback.'\n\n- **Timestamp:** The date and time when the query was classified. This is crucial for maintaining an accurate timeline of when queries are processed and addressed.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n- If a query does not match any existing classification type, there should be a default classification to ensure no queries remain unclassified, or the system should prompt for the creation of a new classification category.\n\n- In cases where a query is reclassified, the system should update the classification record accordingly to reflect the most current category, potentially retaining the history of changes for auditing purposes.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\nImagine a scenario where a customer calls with a complaint about a delayed shipment. The customer service representative would use this function to assign the query a unique ID, classify it under the 'Shipping Issue' category, and record the exact time at which the classification was made. This information is then stored in the system for future reference, allowing for trends in shipping issues to be analyzed over time.\n\nBy implementing this function, organizations can enhance their customer service operations, leading to more efficient query management and insightful data analysis, ultimately contributing to improved customer satisfaction.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["money_movement_start", "get_transactions_start", "credit_limit_increase_start", "faq_link_accounts_start"], "properties": {"money_movement_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries for transferring funds between accounts."}, "get_transactions_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries for viewing transactions, including deposits, purchases, and transaction details."}, "credit_limit_increase_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of customer requests to increase credit card limits or complaints about the current limit."}, "faq_link_accounts_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "List of queries related to linking accounts within the bank's system."}}}}, {"name": "record2", "description": "Records the classification of specified customer service queries.

The NPV is a crucial financial metric used to evaluate the profitability of an investment by determining the present value of expected future cash flows and comparing it to the initial investment.\n\nTo compute the NPV, the function considers the series of future cash flows expected from the investment, which are the amounts of money that are projected to be received or paid at various time intervals. Each cash flow is discounted back to its present value using the given discount rate, which reflects the time value of money and the risk associated with the investment. The discount rate is typically expressed as a percentage and represents the required rate of return that the investor expects to earn.\n\nThe initial investment is the amount of capital that is required at the start of the investment process. This initial outlay is subtracted from the sum of the present values of the future cash flows to compute the NPV. A positive NPV indicates that the projected earnings, in present value terms, exceed the initial investment, suggesting a potentially profitable investment. Conversely, a negative NPV suggests that the investment may not achieve the desired rate of return.\n\nFor example, if an investor expects to receive cash flows of $1000, $1200, and $1500 over the next three years, with an initial investment of $3000 and a discount rate of 10%, the function will discount each of the future cash flows to their present value and subtract the initial investment from the total present value of these cash flows to determine the NPV.

Compound interest is a method of calculating interest where the interest earned over time is added to the principal, and from that point forward, interest is calculated on this new principal amount. This function takes into account several key parameters: the initial principal amount, the annual interest rate, the number of times interest is compounded per year, and the total number of years the money is invested or borrowed for.\n\nTo use this function effectively, the user must provide:\n\n1. **Principal Amount**: This is the initial sum of money that is invested or borrowed. It is crucial as it forms the base on which interest will be calculated.\n\n2. **Annual Interest Rate**: This is the percentage at which the money grows per year. It should be provided as a decimal (for example, an interest rate of 5% should be input as 0.05).\n\n3. **Compounding Frequency**: This parameter defines how many times the interest is applied to the principal per year. Common compounding frequencies include annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, or daily.\n\n4. **Time Period (in years)**: The total duration for which the interest will be compounded. This is usually expressed in years and represents the length of time the principal is invested or borrowed.\n\nAn edge case to consider is when the time period is zero, in which case no interest is accrued, and the principal remains unchanged. Similarly, if the annual interest rate is zero, the principal will not grow regardless of the time period or compounding frequency.\n\nExample usage of this function would look like this: Suppose you have a principal of $1,000, an annual interest rate of 5%, compounded monthly, for a period of 10 years.

Service types may vary and include options such as cleaning, ironing, and potentially other categories depending on the application's context. The unique identifier serves as a distinct reference that differentiates each service type from others within the system.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n- **serviceType (string)**: This parameter specifies the type of service for which you are seeking the unique identifier. It is essential that the input for this parameter accurately matches a valid service type within the system, such as \"cleaning\" or \"ironing\". Providing a service type that does not exist in the system will not yield a valid identifier, and may result in an error or null response.\n\n#### Return Value\n\n- **string**: The function returns a string value that represents the unique identifier of the specified service type. This identifier is used to uniquely distinguish the service type across various operations within the application, such as querying databases, logging operations, or interfacing with other system components.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\nSuppose you want to retrieve the unique identifier for the \"cleaning\" service type. You would call the function and pass the string \"cleaning\" as an argument. The function would then return a string that is the unique ID for the cleaning service.

The calculation is based on three primary factors: the distance the vehicle travels in a year, the type of fuel used by the vehicle, and its fuel efficiency.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n1. **Distance Traveled (annual_distance):** This represents the total distance covered by the vehicle over the course of a year. It is usually measured in miles or kilometers, depending on the preferred unit system. Accurate input of this parameter is crucial as it directly influences the resulting emissions calculation.\n\n2. **Fuel Type (fuel_type):** This denotes the type of fuel the vehicle uses. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, natural gas, and electricity. Different fuels emit varying amounts of CO2 when consumed, and this parameter allows the function to use the appropriate emission factor for the calculation. \n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency (fuel_efficiency):** This is a measure of how effectively a vehicle uses fuel, typically expressed in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). Higher fuel efficiency indicates that the vehicle can travel more distance using less fuel, thus producing fewer emissions for the same distance traveled.\n\n**Calculation Process:**\n\nThe core calculation involves determining the total fuel consumption for the given distance based on the vehicle's fuel efficiency. Once the total fuel consumption is established, the function applies the specific emission factor associated with the fuel type to calculate the total CO2 emissions. The emission factor is a standard value that indicates the amount of CO2 released per unit of fuel consumed.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n- **Extreme Values for Distance:** When calculating emissions for vehicles that travel extremely high or low annual distances, ensure that the inputs remain realistic.

By leveraging location data, the function identifies stores within a specified radius of the user's current location or a provided address. The primary purpose is to cater to users who prioritize organic produce in their shopping choices.\n\n#### Key Features:\n\n- **Location-Based Search:** The function utilizes geolocation services to determine the user's current position or accepts a manually specified location to perform the search. This ensures that the results are relevant and geographically accessible to the user.\n  \n- **Organic Produce Focus:** Specifically tailored for users seeking organic options, the function filters grocery stores to highlight those that offer organic fruits and vegetables. This is particularly useful for individuals committed to maintaining an organic lifestyle.\n\n- **Customizable Criteria:** While the primary focus is on organic fruits and vegetables, the function may also support additional filtering criteria. These could include preferences for certain store types, brands, or other organic product offerings if such details are provided by the user.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Variable Product Availability:** Given that inventory can vary significantly between stores and even within stores over time, the function's results may not always reflect real-time stock levels. Users should verify with the store directly for the most current availability of organic products.\n\n- **Geographic Limitations:** In rural or less populated areas, the number of stores that meet the specified criteria might be limited, resulting in fewer search results. Users in such regions may need to expand the search radius or refine their criteria.\n\n- **Data Accuracy:** The function's effectiveness is contingent upon the accuracy and currency of the store data it accesses. Discrepancies in store listings or outdated information can affect the search results.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nTo use this function, a user might input their current location, either manually or via location services.
