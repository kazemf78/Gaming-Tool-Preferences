The resonant frequency is a critical characteristic of the circuit and is defined as the frequency at which the circuit naturally oscillates due to the exchange of energy between the inductor and capacitor. This frequency is significant because, at resonance, the inductive and capacitive reactances cancel each other out, resulting in a purely resistive impedance.\n\nTo perform this calculation, the function requires two inputs: the inductance (L) of the inductor, typically measured in henrys (H), and the capacitance (C) of the capacitor, usually measured in farads (F). Utilizing these inputs, the function applies the universally recognized formula for determining resonant frequency, given by \\( f = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sqrt{LC}} \\), where \\( f \\) is the resonant frequency measured in hertz (Hz).\n\nSome important considerations include ensuring that both the inductance and capacitance values are positive, as negative or zero values would not be physically meaningful and would lead to mathematical errors or undefined behavior in the calculation. Additionally, if either L or C is extremely small, it could result in a very high resonant frequency, potentially exceeding the range of practical or safely operable frequencies for certain applications. Therefore, it is important to validate the input parameters to prevent unrealistic outputs.\n\nHere is a simple example of how the function can be used:\nSuppose you have an inductor with an inductance of 0.5 henrys and a capacitor with a capacitance of 0.02 farads.

It prepares data for machine learning models, ensuring numerical values are scaled properly and categorical variables are appropriately transformed.This function is designed to preprocess input data through a two-step procedure that ensures the data is in a suitable format for machine learning models. The first step involves normalization of numerical values. Normalization is a technique used to adjust the scale of numerical data to a specific range, typically between 0 and 1, or to standardize it to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This is crucial for many algorithms that are sensitive to differences in scale, such as distance-based models like k-nearest neighbors or gradient descent optimization in neural networks, as it ensures that no single numerical feature dominates the model training simply due to differing scales.\n\nThe second step in the preprocessing process is the encoding of categorical variables. Categorical variables, which represent discrete categories rather than continuous values, must be transformed into a numerical format that can be interpreted by machine learning algorithms. This function handles this transformation through techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding. One-hot encoding creates binary columns for each category within a categorical feature, allowing the model to treat each category as a separate feature. Label encoding, on the other hand, converts each category into an integer value, although care must be taken to ensure that the model does not misinterpret these as ordinal data. \n\nBy applying normalization and encoding, the function ensures that the input data is scaled properly for numerical values and that categorical variables are accurately represented in numerical form.

It is essential for accurately determining the complete cost that a customer will incur, including any taxes imposed by local regulations. The function takes into account the specific tax rate that applies to the jurisdiction in question, ensuring compliance with local tax laws. By doing so, it facilitates businesses and consumers in understanding the total expense involved in a purchase.\n\nThe function processes the given purchase amount and then applies the appropriate sales tax rate associated with the specified jurisdiction. This jurisdiction can vary widely\u2014ranging from states, regions, or even smaller localities\u2014each potentially having unique tax rates. The function is adept at handling these variations, providing a precise calculation of the total amount due.\n\nUpon completion of the calculation, the function returns the total amount, which is the sum of the initial purchase amount and the calculated sales tax. This allows users to have a clear insight into how much they will need to pay, inclusive of tax, thereby aiding in financial planning and transparency.\n\nFor example, consider a scenario where the purchase amount is $100, and the sales tax rate for the jurisdiction is 8%. The function would calculate the sales tax as $8, adding this to the original purchase amount, and ultimately returning $108 as the total amount with tax.\n\nThis function is particularly valuable in retail and e-commerce settings, where understanding the precise amount of sales tax that applies is crucial for both pricing strategies and customer satisfaction.

This involves determining the definite integral of the polynomial between two points, often referred to as the lower and upper bounds of the interval. The polynomial function is typically represented as an expression involving powers of x, such as ax^n + bx^(n-1) + ... + c, where a, b, c, etc., are coefficients, and n is the degree of the polynomial.\n\nTo perform this calculation, the function employs numerical integration techniques, such as the trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule, or more sophisticated algorithms, to approximate the integral if an analytical solution is not straightforward. These techniques divide the interval into smaller segments, compute the area of each segment under the curve, and sum these areas to get an approximation of the total area under the curve.\n\nThe specified interval is defined by two endpoints, often denoted as [a, b], where 'a' is the starting point and 'b' is the endpoint along the x-axis. The function evaluates the polynomial at various points within this interval to ensure an accurate estimation of the area.\n\nThis function is particularly useful in various fields, including physics and engineering, where calculating the area under a curve is essential for determining quantities like displacement, work, or probability.\n\nTo use this function effectively, the user must provide the polynomial coefficients and define the interval of integration clearly. Edge cases include scenarios where the interval has zero length (i.e., when a equals b), which would return an area of zero, or when the polynomial has discontinuities or undefined regions within the interval, requiring careful handling to avoid errors in the calculation. \n\nAn example usage might involve calculating the area under the curve for the polynomial f(x) = 2x^3 - x^2 + 3 over the interval [1, 4], where the bounds 1 and 4 are provided as inputs along with the polynomial coefficients", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"polynomial": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "float"}, "description": "The coefficients of the polynomial, in decreasing order of exponent, where the first element is the coefficient for x^n, the second element is the coefficient for x^(n-1), and so on.

It plays a crucial role in managing and analyzing how customer inquiries and issues are sorted based on their nature and content. By doing so, it aids in streamlining the process of addressing customer needs and optimizing service efficiency.\n\n### Parameters:\n- **queries**: A list or collection of banking-related queries that need to be categorized. Each query typically involves customer concerns or requests related to banking services, such as account information, transaction issues, or loan inquiries.\n\n- **categories**: A predefined set of categories used to classify the queries. These categories might include topics like \"Account Management,\" \"Loans,\" \"Credit Cards,\" \"Fraud Detection,\" \"Transaction Disputes,\" and \"Online Banking,\" among others.\n\n### Functionality:\n- The function processes each query individually and assigns it to the most appropriate category from the list of predefined categories. This categorization process could involve keyword matching, natural language processing, or other heuristic methods to determine the best fit for each query.\n  \n- Once a query is categorized, it is recorded in a structured data format, such as a database or a log file, which allows for easy retrieval, analysis, and reporting. This enables the organization to track the frequency and types of queries received over time, providing insights into customer needs and service performance.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- Queries that do not fit neatly into any existing category may be flagged for further review or assigned to a general category. It\u2019s important for the function to handle such cases gracefully to maintain the integrity of the categorization process.\n\n- The function should also accommodate updates to the list of categories, allowing for the addition of new categories or refinement of existing ones as banking services and customer concerns evolve.\n\n### Example:\nConsider a scenario where a customer submits a query about a recent fraudulent transaction detected in their account:\n\n```python\nquery = \"I noticed an unauthorized transaction on my account.

By using this function, users can maintain an organized and easily accessible record of how each query is categorized, which can be crucial for analytics, reporting, and improving customer service processes.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **query_id**: A unique identifier for each customer service query. This parameter ensures that each query can be distinctly recognized in the database.\n  \n- **classification**: The category or type assigned to the query. This could include classifications such as 'Billing Issue,' 'Technical Support,' 'General Inquiry,' among others. Accurate classification is essential for effective query management and analysis.\n\n- **timestamp**: A record of the date and time when the classification was made. This helps in tracking the response and resolution times.\n\n#### Returns:\n\nThe function returns a confirmation message or a status code indicating whether the classification recording was successful. It may provide feedback such as 'Success,' 'Error: Invalid Query ID,' or 'Error: Undefined Classification' to inform users of the result of the operation.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose a customer service query with the ID `12345` needs to be classified as a 'Technical Support' issue. The function call might look like this:\n\n```python\nrecord_classification(query_id=12345, classification='Technical Support')\n```\n\nUpon successful execution, the query is logged under the specified classification, ensuring that subsequent analysis or follow-ups can be conducted efficiently. This also aids in trend analysis to pinpoint common customer issues.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Invalid Query ID**: If an unknown or invalid `query_id` is provided, the function should ideally handle this by returning an appropriate error message or status code.\n  \n- **Undefined Classification**: If the classification parameter does not match any pre-defined categories, the function should

For strings, it returns the characters in reverse order. For booleans, it returns the negation. For numbers, it returns the negative value.This function is designed to reverse the input provided to it, producing an output that represents the opposite or inverted form of the input. The behavior of the function varies depending on the data type of the input, as it handles strings, booleans, and numbers differently, each in a manner appropriate to its type.\n\nWhen the input is a string, the function processes the input by reversing the order of the characters within the string. For example, if the input string is \"hello\", the function will return \"olleh\". It is important to note that this operation only changes the order of characters, so the characters themselves remain unchanged.\n\nIn the case of a boolean input, the function returns the logical negation of the boolean value. For instance, if the input is `true`, the output will be `false`, and conversely, if the input is `false`, the output will be `true`. This operation effectively inverts the truth value of the boolean.\n\nFor numerical inputs, the function returns the negative value of the number. This means that if a positive number is provided as input, the function will return its negative counterpart. For example, an input of 5 will result in an output of -5. Similarly, if the input is a negative number, the function will return the positive version of that number, such as converting -3 to 3. It is important to consider that if the input is zero, which has no negative counterpart, the output will remain 0.\n\nBy handling these different data types\u2014strings, booleans, and numbers\u2014in a specialized manner, this function provides a versatile tool for reversing or inverting the input across a variety of common scenarios.

It assumes the prices are based on a standard market without promotional adjustments unless otherwise noted.\n\n- **Outdated Data**: In situations where the data source is not updated in real-time, there may be discrepancies in the reported price. The function assumes that the data source is refreshed regularly to minimize the risk of outdated information.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose a user wants to find out the current retail price of a \"Yamaha C40 classical guitar.\" The user would call the function with the parameter set to \"Yamaha C40 classical guitar\". Upon execution, the function would process this request, access the relevant pricing database or API, and return the latest retail price for the Yamaha C40 classical guitar.\n\nOverall, this function", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"brand": {"type": "string", "description": "The brand of the instrument."}, "model": {"type": "string", "description": "The specific model of the instrument."}, "finish": {"type": "string", "description": "The color or type of finish on the instrument."}}, "required": ["brand", "model", "finish"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"instrument_price.get1": {"brand": "Fender", "model": "American Professional II Stratocaster", "finish": "Rosewood Finish"}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"instrument_price.get1": {"brand": "Fender", "model": "American Professional II Stratocaster", "finish": "Rosewood Finish"}}], "possible_answer": [{"instrument_price.get1": {"brand": ["Fender"], "model": ["American Professional II Stratocaster"], "finish": ["Rosewood"]}}, {"instrument_price.get2": {"brand": ["Fender"], "model": ["American Professional II Stratocaster"], "finish": ["Rosewood"]}}, {"instrument_price.get3": {"brand": ["Fender"], "model": ["American Professional II Stratocaster"], "finish": ["Rosewood"]}}]}

The card is determined by two key attributes: its rank and its suit. The rank refers to the value of the card, such as Ace, 2, 3, ..., 10, Jack, Queen, or King. The suit indicates which of the four categories the card belongs to: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, or Spades.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **rank**: This parameter specifies the rank of the card being searched for. It can be any of the standard card ranks, such as numerical values (2 through 10) or face values (Ace, Jack, Queen, King). It is essential for the rank to be provided in a format that matches the structure of the deck being searched.\n  \n- **suit**: This parameter denotes the suit of the card. The suit is typically represented as one of four strings or symbols: \"Hearts\", \"Diamonds\", \"Clubs\", or \"Spades\". Accurate identification of the suit is crucial for pinpointing the exact card in the deck.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\nThe function examines each card in the deck sequentially to find the one that matches both the specified rank and suit. It leverages these attributes to filter through the cards, ensuring that the search is precise and narrows down to only the card that fits both criteria.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n1. **Card Not Found**: If the specified card is not present in the deck, perhaps due to misplacement or an incomplete deck, the function should return a clear indication, such as `null` or an error message, that the card could not be located.\n  \n2. **Duplicate Cards**: In situations where the deck might contain duplicates of a particular card, the function should be designed to return the first instance it encounters, unless specified otherwise by additional parameters or logic.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSupp", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"rank": {"type": "string", "description": "Rank of the card (e.g. Ace, Two, King)."}, "suit": {"type": "string", "description": "Suit of the card (e.g. Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, Clubs)."}, "deck": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"rank": {"type": "string"}, "suit": {"type": "string"}}}, "description": "Deck of cards.
