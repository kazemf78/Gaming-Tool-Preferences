This calculation is particularly useful in scenarios requiring precise measurements of angles, such as graphical representations of clocks or mathematical problems involving time and angles.\n\n### Parameters:\n- **hour (int)**: The hour value from the given time, typically ranging from 0 to 23. If the hour is represented in a 12-hour format, it should be adjusted accordingly to fit within the 0-11 range for the calculation.\n- **minute (int)**: The minute value from the given time, ranging from 0 to 59. This value determines the position of the minute hand on the clock face.\n\n### Function Details:\nThis function computes the angle in degrees. The clock is considered circular, with 360 degrees representing a full rotation. A key aspect of the calculation is that the angle is measured in a clockwise direction from the hour hand to the minute hand. The result provided is the acute angle between the two hands, meaning the function always returns the smaller of the two possible angles.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- **Exactly on the Hour**: If the minute is 0, the minute hand is at the 12 o'clock position, and the hour hand's position is determined solely by the hour value.\n- **Same Hour and Minute**: If both hands overlap, such as at 12:00, the calculated angle will be 0 degrees.\n- **Maximum Separation**: At times like 6:00, the hands are diametrically opposite to each other, resulting in an angle of 180 degrees.\n\n### Usage Example:\nTo calculate the angle at 3:15:\n1. The hour hand is at a quarter past three, contributing to its position at 3/12 * 360 + 15/60 * 30 = 97.5 degrees.\n2.

It aims to simplify the process of connecting to Bluetooth devices by eliminating the need to know the device's address or other technical details, focusing solely on the device's name for identification. \n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **deviceName (String)**: This parameter takes the name of the Bluetooth device you wish to connect to. It is critical that the name provided matches the exact name of the target device as listed in the Bluetooth settings or discovery list. The function's success relies on the accuracy of this name, and any deviation or misspelling may result in a failed connection attempt.\n\n#### Functionality and Edge Cases:\n\n- The function performs a scan of available Bluetooth devices in the vicinity. It filters the results based on the provided device name to locate the intended device.\n- If multiple devices with the same name are found, the function might connect to the first recognized match or may require additional logic to handle such cases, depending on its implementation.\n- In situations where the Bluetooth device is not discoverable or out of range, the function will not establish a connection. It may return an error or a status indicating that the device could not be found.\n- Should the device be turned off or have disabled its Bluetooth functionality, the function will also not succeed in connecting.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\n```python\n# Example usage of the function\ndevice_name = \"WirelessSpeaker\"\nsuccess = connectToBluetoothDevice(device_name)\n\nif success:\n    print(\"Connection established successfully.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Failed to connect to the Bluetooth device.\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `connectToBluetoothDevice` is called with the `deviceName` \"WirelessSpeaker\".

Allows for the bulk recording of query classifications in one function call.This function is designed to efficiently record classifications for multiple queries in a single operation, making it particularly useful for handling large datasets where each query is associated with a specific intent. The intent names, which determine the purpose or category of each query, are provided as keyword arguments. By utilizing keyword arguments, the function offers a flexible interface, allowing users to specify intent names dynamically in a convenient manner.\n\nEach keyword argument represents a unique query-intent pair, where the keyword is typically the query identifier or name, and the argument value is the corresponding intent name.

This versatile function handles different data types in distinct ways, ensuring that each is processed appropriately to achieve a reversed or inverted result.\n\nFor string inputs, the function processes the sequence of characters by reversing their order. This means that the first character of the original string becomes the last character in the output, the second character becomes second to last, and so forth. For example, if the input is the string \"hello,\" the function will return \"olleh.\"\n\nWhen the input is a boolean value, the function performs a logical inversion.

It is important to note that this function assumes that the annual growth rate remains consistent over the entire holding period, enabling the application of compound interest calculations to determine the final projected return.\n\nThe formula used to calculate the projected return is based on the principle of compound interest, given by the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Projected Return} = \\text{Investment Amount} \\times (1 + \\frac{\\text{Annual Growth Rate}}{100})^{\\text{Holding Period}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- The Investment Amount is the initial sum of money invested.\n- The Annual Growth Rate is divided by 100 to convert the percentage into a decimal for calculation purposes.\n- The Holding Period is the number of years the money is invested.\n\nAn example of usage for this function could be as follows: if an investor places $10,000 into a stock with an anticipated annual growth rate of 5% and plans to hold the investment for 10 years, the function will calculate the projected return by plugging these values into the formula, resulting in a future value of approximately $16,288.95.\n\nIt is important for users of this function to ensure the accuracy of their inputs, particularly the investment amount and growth rate, as any errors in these values", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"investment_amount": {"type": "integer", "description": "The amount of money to invest."}, "annual_growth_rate": {"type": "float", "description": "The expected annual growth rate of the stock."}, "holding_period": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of years you intend to hold the stock."}, "dividends": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Optional.

This function is particularly useful when you need to run commands that would typically be entered manually in the command prompt or terminal.\n\nThe `os.system()` function takes a string argument, which represents the command or set of commands you wish to execute. For example, if you want to execute a single command, you can simply pass that command as a string to the function. In cases where you need to execute multiple commands in sequence, you can chain them together using the '&&' operator.

Additionally, `os.system()` returns a status code upon completion, which can be used to determine whether the command was executed successfully. A return value of `0` typically indicates success, while any other value suggests an error occurred during execution.\n\nHere are a few usage examples:\n\n1.

It can execute single or multiple commands chained with '&&'.The function is designed to execute system-level commands specifically on Windows operating systems. It utilizes the `os.system()` method, which is a part of the `os` module in Python, to carry out this task. The `os.system()` function is a straightforward way to run commands as if they were being executed directly in the command prompt of Windows. This can include a wide range of operations, from simple directory listings to more complex command scripts.\n\nA notable feature of this function is its ability to handle multiple commands at once. This is achieved by chaining commands together using the '&&' operator. In the context of command execution, the '&&' operator allows users to run several commands in sequence. The subsequent command will only execute if the preceding command is successful, meaning it returns a zero exit status. This feature is particularly useful for executing a series of dependent commands where the success of one command is required for the next to proceed.\n\nFor example, a user can execute a command string such as `\"dir && echo 'Listed directories'\"`. In this case, the `dir` command will list the contents of the current directory. If this operation is successful, it will proceed to execute the `echo 'Listed directories'` command, which outputs the text 'Listed directories' to the console. This chaining feature enhances the versatility of the function, enabling more complex command sequences to be executed in a controlled manner.\n\nWhen using this function, it is important to handle the commands carefully to avoid any unintended system changes or security vulnerabilities. Since `os.system()` executes commands in the system shell, it has the same level of access as the user running the script, which can lead to potentially destructive operations if not used cautiously.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["command"], "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The system command to be executed.

This calculation is essential for understanding the environmental impact of a vehicle's operation over the course of a year. The function takes into account three primary factors to determine these emissions: the distance traveled by the vehicle, the type of fuel that the vehicle uses, and the fuel efficiency of the vehicle.\n\n1. **Distance Traveled**: This parameter represents the total number of miles or kilometers that the vehicle covers in a year. It is a crucial factor because the more a vehicle is driven, the more fuel it consumes, and consequently, the more emissions it produces.\n\n2. **Fuel Type**: The type of fuel used by the vehicle plays a significant role in the calculation. Different fuels have varying carbon content and therefore produce different amounts of carbon dioxide when burned. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, and alternative fuels like natural gas or electricity. Each of these fuels has a specific carbon dioxide emission factor, which is used in the calculation to ensure accurate results.\n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency**: Also known as fuel economy, this parameter measures how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel to cover a distance. It is typically expressed in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). A vehicle with higher fuel efficiency will consume less fuel over the same distance compared to a less efficient vehicle, thereby producing fewer emissions.\n\nThe function combines these parameters in a formula to determine the total annual carbon dioxide emissions for the vehicle. It is important to input accurate values for each parameter to ensure the validity of the calculation. This information can be beneficial for vehicle owners seeking to reduce their carbon footprint by understanding the emissions associated with their driving habits and vehicle characteristics.\n\n**Example Usage**:\n- A user can input the following: a vehicle that travels 15,000 miles annually, runs on gasoline, and has a fuel efficiency of 25 MPG.
