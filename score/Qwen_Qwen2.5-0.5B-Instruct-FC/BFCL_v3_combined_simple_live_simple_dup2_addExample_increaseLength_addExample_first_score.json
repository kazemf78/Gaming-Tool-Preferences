If the LLM does not provide an answer, it returns an empty string.This function is designed to take a response from a Large Language Model (LLM) as an input, and its primary purpose is to parse or analyze this response in order to extract the relevant answer embedded within it. The function meticulously inspects the structure and content of the LLM's output to identify the portion that constitutes the answer.

A larger mass will require or release more energy during the phase transition.\n\n2. **Phase Transition Temperature**: This is the temperature at which the substance changes from one phase to another, such as from solid to liquid (melting), liquid to gas (vaporization), or vice versa. The phase transition temperature is crucial as it defines the condition under which the phase change occurs but does not directly affect the energy calculation beyond ensuring the substance is at the right temperature for the transition.\n\n3. **Specific Latent Heat**: This is a material-specific constant that represents the amount of energy required to change the phase of one kilogram of the substance without changing its temperature. It is expressed in joules per kilogram (J/kg). Different phase changes (e.g., melting, freezing, boiling, condensation) have different specific latent heats even for the same substance.\n\nThe function computes the energy using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Energy} = \\text{Mass} \\times \\text{Specific Latent Heat} \\]\n\nThis calculation assumes that the substance is at the exact phase transition temperature and that any temperature effects, like supercooling or superheating, are negligible. The result can be either positive or negative, depending on whether the phase change is endothermic (energy absorbed, e.g., melting or vaporization) or exothermic (energy released, e.g., freezing or condensation).\n\n**Usage Example**:\n- To calculate the energy", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"mass": {"type": "integer", "description": "Mass of the substance in grams."}, "phase_transition": {"type": "string", "description": "Phase transition.

This predictive capability leverages a model trained on a dataset that correlates these physical attributes with the incidence of diabetes type 2, thus providing a probabilistic assessment.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `weight`: This parameter represents the individual\u2019s weight, typically measured in kilograms or pounds. It is crucial to ensure that the weight input is accurately measured and converted to the appropriate unit to maintain the integrity of the prediction.\n- `height`: The height of the individual is another critical input, usually recorded in meters or inches. Similar to weight, the height should be precisely measured and standardized to the unit expected by the function for consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Functionality:**\n- The function processes these inputs through a computational model, which likely involves statistical or machine learning algorithms trained to recognize patterns between body mass index (BMI), calculated from height and weight, and the predisposition to Type 2 diabetes.\n- The output is a probability score that indicates the likelihood of the individual developing diabetes type 2. This score is typically a value between 0 and 1, where a higher value suggests an increased risk.\n\n**Edge Cases and Considerations:**\n- Ensure that the input values for weight and height are within a reasonable range to avoid skewed predictions. Extremely low or high values may not be within the valid range that the model was trained on and could lead to inaccurate predictions.\n- Consider the unit consistency for weight and height. If the function expects metric units, then inputs should be converted accordingly if they are initially provided in imperial units.\n- The function does not account for other risk factors such as age, family history, or lifestyle, which are also significant contributors to the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.

To calculate this, the function requires two key pieces of data: the total population of the country in the specified year and the land area of the country.\n\nParameters:\n\n1. `country_name` (string): The name of the country for which you want to calculate the population density. This should be the official name as recognized in international databases to ensure accuracy.\n\n2. `year` (integer): The specific year you are interested in.

It should be in the format of a four-digit year, for example, 2020.\n\nUsage:\n\nTo use this function, ensure you have reliable datasets that can provide the total population and land area for the country in the specified year. It's important to have accurate data since the function depends on these inputs to deliver a precise result.\n\nFor example, if you want to calculate the population density of Japan in the year 2020, you would need to know Japan's total population and land area for that year.

This means that the speed is determined by dividing the total distance covered by the total time taken to cover that distance.\n\nParameters:\n- **distance**: This parameter represents the total length of the path travelled by the object. It should be provided in units that are consistent with the time parameter to ensure that the speed calculation is accurate. For instance, if the distance is measured in kilometers, the time should be in hours to result in a speed measurement in kilometers per hour (km/h).\n- **time**: This parameter represents the duration over which the distance was travelled. It should be provided in units that correspond with the distance parameter to maintain consistency. For example, if the distance is in meters, time should ideally be in seconds to yield a speed in meters per second (m/s).\n\nUsage Example:\nSuppose an object has travelled a distance of 100 kilometers over a time span of 2 hours.

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees at training time and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. This method is highly effective in handling both regression and classification tasks and is known for its robustness, accuracy, and ability to manage large datasets with higher dimensionality.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **data**: The input dataset on which the Random Forest model will be trained. This dataset should include both features and target variables. It is essential that the data is preprocessed correctly, with any missing values addressed and categorical variables appropriately encoded. The quality and representation of the input data can significantly impact the performance of the trained model.\n\n- **target_variable**: The specific column or feature within the dataset that the model should predict. This target variable can be categorical or continuous, depending on whether the task is classification or regression, respectively.\n\n- **n_estimators (optional)**: The number of trees in the forest. More trees can improve accuracy but also increase computation time. Typically, users might set this parameter to a default like 100 if not specified otherwise.\n\n- **max_depth (optional)**: The maximum depth of each tree. Limiting the depth of the tree helps prevent overfitting. Setting this to `None` allows nodes to expand until all leaves are pure or contain fewer than `min_samples_split` samples.\n\n- **random_state (optional)**: A seed used by the random number generator. Setting a random state ensures reproducible results by initializing the random number generator in the same state every time the code is run.\n\n#### Returns:\n\n- **model**: The trained Random Forest model object. This object encapsulates the learned patterns and rules from the dataset and can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\n```python", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"n_estimators": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of trees in the forest."}, "max_depth": {"type": "integer", "description": "The maximum depth of the tree."}, "data": {"type": "any", "description": "The training data for the model."}}, "required": ["n_estimators", "max_depth", "data"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "Error during inference: name 'my_data' is not defined", "model_result_decoded": [], "possible_answer": [{"random_forest.train1": {"n_estimators": [100], "max_depth": [5], "data": ["my_data"]}}, {"random_forest.train2": {"n_estimators": [100], "max_depth": [5], "data": ["my_data"]}}, {"random_forest.train3": {"n_estimators": [100], "max_depth": [5], "data": ["my_data"]}}]}

Allows for the bulk recording of query classifications in one function call.This function is designed to efficiently manage and record the classification of a large number of queries by associating them with specific intent names. It achieves this by leveraging keyword arguments, where each keyword corresponds to an intent name, and the associated value is a collection of queries that share this intent. By using this approach, users can perform bulk recordings of query classifications in a single function call, significantly streamlining the process.\n\n### Parameters\n\n- **intent_name**: Keyword arguments where each keyword represents the name of an intent. This acts as a label that describes the purpose or goal of the queries associated with it.\n\n- **queries**: The values that accompany each intent name keyword argument. These are the actual queries that need to be classified. They can be provided in various iterable forms, such as lists or tuples, allowing for flexibility in input data structures.\n\n### Functionality\n\nWhen you call this function, it processes each keyword argument, taking the name of the keyword as the intent and the corresponding value as the list of queries. The function then records the association between each query and its intent, effectively classifying them in bulk. This method is particularly useful for applications that require organizing a large number of queries systematically, such as natural language processing tasks, chatbots, or automated customer service systems.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- If no queries are provided for a given intent, the function will simply record the intent with an empty list of queries, ensuring that all intents are processed but without any associated data.\n  \n- If duplicate queries are provided under the same intent, the function will still record each instance, as this might be intentional depending on the use case (e.g., tracking frequency of certain queries).\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\n# Example of how to call the function with multiple intents and their associated queries\nrecord_classifications(\n    greeting=[\"Hello\", \"Hi there\", \"Good morning\"],\n    farewell=[\"Goodbye\", \"See you later\", \"Take care\"],\n    inquiry=[\"What's the weather", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["acc_routing_start", "atm_finder_start", "faq_link_accounts_start", "get_balance_start", "get_transactions_start", "outofscope"], "properties": {"acc_routing_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries requesting the bank routing numbers or account numbers."}, "atm_finder_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for locations of ATMs, specified in the format of 'City, State (abbr)', such as 'Berkeley, CA' or 'New York, NY'."}, "faq_link_accounts_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to linking accounts within the bank's system."}, "get_balance_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for account balances, available funds, or other financial balances."}, "get_transactions_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to viewing transactions, deposits, purchases, and transaction details."}, "outofscope": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries that do not classify to any other available intents."}}}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"record_classifications": {"acc_routing_start": ["what is the weather like"], "outofscope": ["what is the weather like"]}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"record_classifications": {"acc_routing_start": ["what is the weather like"], "outofscope": ["what is the weather like"]}}], "possible_answer": [{"record1": {"acc_routing_start": [], "atm_finder_start": [], "faq_link_accounts_start": [], "get_balance_start": [], "get_transactions_start": [], "outofscope": [["what is the weather like"]]}}, {"record2": {"acc_routing_start": [], "atm_finder_start": [], "faq_link_accounts_start": [], "get_balance_start": [], "get_transactions_start": [], "outofscope": [["what is the weather like"]]}}, {"record3": {"acc_routing_start": [], "atm_finder_start": [], "faq_link_accounts_start": [], "get_balance_start": [], "get_transactions_start": [], "outofscope": [["what is the weather like"]]}}]}

It evaluates the profitability of a project or investment by considering a sequence of future cash flows, a specified discount rate, and the initial capital investment.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n1. **Future Cash Flows**: This parameter represents a series of anticipated cash inflows and outflows over the life of the investment. These cash flows can vary in amounts and are typically listed in chronological order, usually annually, but could also be on a quarterly or monthly basis depending on the specific analysis requirements.\n\n2. **Discount Rate**: This parameter is the rate of return used to discount future cash flows back to their present values. It reflects the opportunity cost of capital or the desired rate of return. The choice of discount rate can significantly affect the calculated NPV, as it accounts for the time value of money, where future money is worth less than present money.\n\n3. **Initial Investment**: This parameter signifies the upfront cost required to commence the investment. It is typically a negative cash flow at the beginning of the investment timeline, representing the outlay of capital necessary for starting the project or acquiring the asset.\n\n#### Calculation:\n\nThe NPV function calculates the present value of each future cash flow by applying the discount rate to each cash flow individually. It then sums these present values and subtracts the initial investment from this sum. The formula for calculating NPV is as follows:\n\n\\[ NPV = \\sum \\left(\\frac{CF_t}{(1 + r)^t}\\right) - I \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( CF_t \\) = Cash flow at time \\( t \\)\n- \\( r \\) = Discount rate\n- \\( t \\) = Time period (usually in years)\n- \\( I \\) = Initial investment\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Zero Cash Flows**:", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"cash_flows": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "integer"}, "description": "Series of future cash flows."}, "discount_rate": {"type": "float", "description": "The discount rate to use."}, "initial_investment": {"type": "integer", "description": "The initial investment.

This calculation is based on two key inputs: the total dividend payout for the quarter and the number of outstanding shares.\n\n- **Total Dividend Payout**: This is the complete amount of money that a company has decided to distribute to its shareholders during a specific quarter. It reflects the portion of the company's earnings allocated to its shareholders as a return on their investment in the form of dividends.\n\n- **Outstanding Shares**: This refers to the total number of shares that are currently held by all shareholders, including institutional investors and company insiders, but excluding any shares that the company holds in its treasury.\n\nThe function takes these inputs and divides the total dividend payout by the number of outstanding shares. This division yields the quarterly dividend per share, which represents the amount of money each shareholder would receive for each share they own during that quarter. It is crucial for the inputs to be accurately provided to ensure the calculated dividend per share reflects the true distribution intended by the company's board of directors.\n\nThis function is particularly useful for investors and analysts who wish to determine the yield of their investment based on the company's performance and dividend policy.

The NPV calculation is fundamental in financial analysis as it aids in determining the value of an investment by discounting future cash flows to their present value, thereby allowing for an assessment of profitability.\n\nTo perform this calculation, the function requires a series of cash flows, which are usually represented as a list or an array, where each element corresponds to a cash flow occurring at a specific time period. These cash flows may include both incoming cash, such as revenue, and outgoing cash, such as expenses or initial investments.\n\nThe function also requires an interest rate, often called the discount rate, which is a critical parameter in the NPV calculation. The discount rate reflects the time value of money, risk associated with the investment, and opportunity cost. It's used to discount future cash flows back to their present value, providing a comprehensive view of the project's worth today.\n\nFor each cash flow in the series, the function applies the formula for Net Present Value: NPV = \u03a3 (C_t / (1 + r)^t), where C_t represents the cash flow at time t, r is the discount rate, and t is the time period. This formula ensures that each future cash flow is appropriately adjusted for the time value of money.\n\nEdge cases to consider when using this function include scenarios where cash flows are zero or negative across all periods, which would result in an NPV of zero or a negative value, respectively. Additionally, attention should be paid to the choice of the discount rate, as an excessively high or low rate can significantly affect the NPV outcome, potentially leading to misleading investment decisions.\n\nHere is a simple usage example:\n\n```python\ncash_flows = [-1000, 300, 400, 500, 600]\ndiscount_rate = 0.05\n\nnpv = calculate_npv(c", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"cash_flows": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "integer"}, "description": "A list of cash flows."}, "discount_rate": {"type": "float", "description": "The annual interest rate used to discount the cash flows."}, "years": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "integer"}, "description": "A list of years when the cash flow occurs.

The primary purpose of this function is to run commands directly in the operating system's command-line interface (CLI), which is generally the Command Prompt on Windows.\n\nA notable feature of this function is its ability to execute not just a single command, but also multiple commands chained together. This chaining is accomplished using the '&&' operator, which allows for the sequential execution of commands. When commands are chained with '&&', each subsequent command will only execute if the preceding command has completed successfully.

If the `cd` command fails, the `dir` command will not be executed.\n\nIt is important to note that the `os.system()` function returns the exit status of the command run. A return code of `0` typically indicates that the command was successful, while a non-zero return code indicates an error occurred during execution. This return value can be used to perform further error handling or logging within your program.

It does so by taking into account three primary parameters: the total initial investment amount, the annual yield rate, and the investment time period. These parameters are crucial for accurately determining how much the initial investment will grow over the specified time period.\n\n- **Total Initial Investment**: This parameter represents the amount of money initially invested in the mutual fund. It serves as the principal amount from which the investment will grow, based on the specified yield rate.\n\n- **Annual Yield Rate**: The annual yield rate is expressed as a percentage and signifies the expected rate of return on the investment each year. It is used to calculate the compound interest earned on the initial investment over the specified period.\n\n- **Time Period**: This parameter specifies the duration, typically in years, for which the investment will be held in the mutual fund. It determines how many times the annual yield rate should be applied to the initial investment.\n\nThe function employs the principles of compound interest to calculate the final balance. Compound interest involves reinvesting the earnings each year, so that interest is earned on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous years.

The calculation is based on three crucial parameters: the distance traveled by the vehicle in that year, the type of fuel the vehicle uses, and the fuel efficiency of the vehicle.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n1. **Distance Traveled**: This parameter represents the total number of miles or kilometers the vehicle has traveled in a year. It is a critical factor, as greater distances typically result in higher emissions.\n\n2. **Fuel Type**: The type of fuel the vehicle uses significantly impacts the calculation. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, electric, and hybrid options. Each fuel type has a specific carbon emissions factor, which denotes the amount of carbon dioxide produced per unit of fuel consumed. This emissions factor is essential for accurately estimating the vehicle's carbon footprint.\n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency**: This represents how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel, usually expressed in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). Higher fuel efficiency indicates that the vehicle can travel further on a smaller amount of fuel, potentially reducing the total emissions.\n\n**Calculation Process:**\n\nThe function combines these parameters to estimate the annual carbon dioxide emissions. It considers the distance traveled and divides it by the vehicle's fuel efficiency to determine the total fuel consumed over the year. This result is then multiplied by the carbon emissions factor associated with the selected fuel type to calculate the total emissions in terms of carbon dioxide.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n- If the distance traveled is zero, the function should correctly return zero emissions, as no travel means no fuel consumption or emissions.\n- If the fuel efficiency is excessively high, it could result in minimal emissions even for significant travel distances, which should be correctly processed.\n- Different fuel types with different emissions factors must be handled accurately to reflect real-world differences in carbon output.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\nSuppose a vehicle travels 15,000 kilometers in", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"distance": {"type": "integer", "description": "The distance travelled in miles."}, "fuel_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of fuel used by the vehicle."}, "fuel_efficiency": {"type": "float", "description": "The vehicle's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon."}, "efficiency_reduction": {"type": "integer", "description": "The percentage decrease in fuel efficiency per year (optional).

It seamlessly integrates with Spotify's API to deliver a smooth user experience, ensuring that users can find and listen to music efficiently.\n\n#### Detailed Functionality\n\n1. **Query Input**: \n   - The function accepts a single input parameter, typically a string, which serves as the search query. This query can be the song's title, artist's name, album, or even a combination thereof. For optimal results, users should ensure that the query is as specific as possible to increase the chances of finding the desired track.\n\n2. **Search Mechanism**:\n   - Upon receiving the query, the function initiates a search process by interfacing with Spotify's extensive music database via its API. This involves sending the query string to Spotify's search endpoint, which then returns a list of tracks that match the criteria.\n   - The function is capable of handling a variety of input formats, such as full song titles, partial titles, or artist names. However, ambiguous or overly broad queries might return multiple results or none at all.\n\n3. **Selection and Playback**:\n   - Once the search results are obtained, the function proceeds to select a track. The selection process may involve choosing the first result or applying additional logic to determine the most relevant track, depending on the implementation specifics.\n   - After a track is selected, the function commands Spotify to play the track. This step involves communicating with the Spotify API to control playback, which may require authorization and proper API credentials from the user.\n\n#### Considerations and Edge Cases\n\n- **Authorization**: \n  - Users must have a valid Spotify account and be authorized to access Spotify's API. This typically involves OAuth 2.0 authentication, which ensures that the function has the necessary permissions to search and play music.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["query"], "properties": {"query": {"type": "string", "description": "The search query for the song, including track and artist information, in the format 'track:SongName artist:ArtistName', such as 'track:Doxy artist:Miles Davis'."}, "shuffle": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Indicates whether to play the songs in shuffle mode, use default if not specified", "default": false}, "volume": {"type": "integer", "description": "The volume level to set when playing the song, expressed as a percentage from 0 to 100m, use default if not specified", "default": 50}}}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"play_spotify_song1": {"query": "Friends Marshmello"}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"play_spotify_song1": {"query": "Friends Marshmello"}}], "possible_answer": [{"play_spotify_song1": {"query": ["track:Friends artist:Marshmello"], "shuffle": ["", false], "volume": ["", 50]}}, {"play_spotify_song2": {"query": ["track:Friends artist:Marshmello"], "shuffle": ["", false], "volume": ["", 50]}}, {"play_spotify_song3": {"query": ["track:Friends artist:Marshmello"], "shuffle": ["", false], "volume": ["", 50]}}]}

By leveraging the powerful search capabilities of Spotify, the function allows users to input a query that can include parts of the song title, artist name, album, or other related metadata. Upon receiving the query, the function initiates a search within Spotify's extensive music library to find the best match or list of matches that correspond to the user's input.\n\nOnce the function identifies the correct song from the search results, it proceeds to play the song through the Spotify platform. The function ensures that the song is played using the user's Spotify account, provided that the account is authenticated and has the necessary permissions to play music through the service.\n\n#### Parameter Explanation\n\n- **query**: The query parameter is a string that represents the search term or terms the user wishes to use to find a song on Spotify. This can be a fragment or complete song title, the artist's name, album name, or a combination thereof. The query should be formulated to maximize the accuracy of the search results.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\nSuppose a user wants to listen to \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by Queen. The user can call the function with the query parameter set to \"Bohemian Rhapsody Queen\" or simply \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" to search for the song. The function will then search Spotify's library, identify the track, and proceed to play it.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n\n- If the query does not correspond to any identifiable song, the function should handle this scenario gracefully, possibly by returning an error message or prompt indicating that no match was found.\n- If multiple songs match the query closely, the function may either play the first result or prompt the user to choose from a list of possible matches.\n- The function requires an active internet connection and a valid Spotify account with streaming permissions to function correctly.

After identifying the desired song from the search results, the function proceeds to initiate playback of the selected song. \n\nThe query parameter is critical, as it determines the accuracy and relevance of the search results. It is important for the user to be as specific as possible to increase the likelihood of finding the exact song they intend to listen to.

It is particularly useful for managers, team leads, or project coordinators who need an overview of the projects their team is currently involved in. The function includes optional parameters that allow users to customize the list according to specific needs, improving the relevance and clarity of the information retrieved.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **team_id**: The unique identifier for the team whose projects are being queried. This parameter is mandatory and serves as the primary filter for the function, ensuring that only projects linked to this specific team are returned.\n\n- **exclude_inactive** (optional): A boolean parameter that, when set to `true`, will exclude any projects that are marked as inactive. This is useful for users who are only interested in active projects that require attention and resources. By default, this parameter is set to `false`, meaning that inactive projects will be included in the results unless this option is explicitly enabled.\n\n- **exclude_child_projects** (optional): Another boolean parameter that allows users to exclude child projects from the list. Child projects are typically those that are part of a larger parent project. Users might choose to exclude these to focus on standalone projects or parent projects. The default value for this parameter is `false`, indicating that child projects will be included unless the user specifies otherwise.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- If the `team_id` provided does not correspond to any existing team, the function may return an empty list or an error message, depending on implementation details.\n\n- When both `exclude_inactive` and `exclude_child_projects` are set to `true`, the resulting list will contain only active, standalone projects associated with the specified team.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n\nSuppose a project manager wants to retrieve a list of all active projects for Team Alpha without any child projects.

This analysis is conducted based on two critical pieces of information: the building's unique identifier (Id) and the number of floors it comprises. By utilizing these parameters, the function provides insights into various structural aspects of the building, helping to assess its design and integrity.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- **Id** (String/Integer): This parameter represents the unique identifier assigned to the building. It is crucial for distinguishing the building from others in the dataset and allows the function to retrieve and analyze specific data relevant to the building's structural attributes. The Id should be a value that accurately identifies the building within the system or database being used.\n\n- **Floor Numbers** (Integer): This parameter specifies the total number of floors present in the building. It is essential for evaluating the building's vertical structure and is a determinant in calculating load distributions, the building's stability, and other structural dynamics. The floor number must be a positive integer, as negative or zero values would not represent a valid physical building structure.\n\n#### Usage Example:\n```python\n# Example usage of the AnalyzeBuildingStructure function\nbuilding_id = \"B123\"\nfloor_count = 10\nanalysis_result = AnalyzeBuildingStructure(Id=building_id, FloorNumbers=floor_count)\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `AnalyzeBuildingStructure` is called with a building Id of \"B123\" and a floor count of 10.

Blackjack is a popular card game where the main objective is to achieve a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. In a standard game, players compete against the dealer rather than each other, trying to either beat the dealer\u2019s hand or have the dealer bust (go over 21).\n\n#### Key Functionalities:\n1. **Assessing Hand Values**: The function calculates the total value of both the player's and the dealer's hands by summing the values of the individual cards. Special attention is given to the Ace card, which can be counted as either 1 or 11, depending on which value keeps the hand total closest to 21 without busting.\n\n2. **Bust Condition**: If either the player's or dealer's hand exceeds a total of 21, it is considered a \u2018bust,\u2019 and the other party automatically wins, provided they have a valid hand. The function ensures that this rule is rigorously applied to determine the winner.\n\n3. **Comparing Hand Values**: In cases where no bust occurs, the function compares the hand values. The hand with a total closer to 21 is determined to be the winner. It also handles the scenario where both hands have the same value, which typically results in a \u2018push\u2019 or tie, where neither party wins.\n\n4. **Blackjack Condition**: If a player or dealer achieves a hand value of exactly 21 with their initial two cards (usually an Ace and a 10-value card), it is considered a \u2018blackjack,\u2019 and this hand typically beats all other 21-value hands that are not blackjacks. The function incorporates this rule in determining the outcome.\n\n#### Edge Cases Handled:\n- If both the dealer and player bust, the function will determine the winner based on the specific rules of the game implemented, which can vary; generally, this", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"player_cards": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "Cards held by the player."}, "dealer_cards": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "Cards held by the dealer."}, "ace_value": {"type": "integer", "description": "The value considered for the ace card, can be either 1 or 11.", "default": 11}}, "required": ["player_cards", "dealer_cards"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": "Error during inference: name 'ace_value' is not defined", "model_result_decoded": [], "possible_answer": [{"blackjack.check_winner1": {"player_cards": [["A", "10"]], "dealer_cards": [["10", "9"]], "ace_value": [1]}}, {"blackjack.check_winner2": {"player_cards": [["A", "10"]], "dealer_cards": [["10", "9"]], "ace_value": [1]}}, {"blackjack.check_winner3": {"player_cards": [["A", "10"]], "dealer_cards": [["10", "9"]], "ace_value": [1]}}]}

The function will return the effective exchange rate, which you can use to calculate the amount in USD, knowing that it accounts for the 2% additional cost.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- Ensure that both currency codes are valid and supported. If an unsupported or invalid code is provided, the function should handle this gracefully, possibly returning an error or a default value indicating the invalid input.\n- Consider scenarios where the transaction fee might be zero, in which case the effective exchange rate would equal the base exchange rate without any additional costs.\n- Handle cases where network issues or data", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"base_currency": {"type": "string", "description": "The base currency."}, "target_currency": {"type": "string", "description": "The target currency."}, "fee": {"type": "float", "description": "The transaction fee in percentage.

It allows users to input an amount in the original currency and specify both the source currency and the target currency. The function then applies the relevant exchange rate to calculate and return the equivalent amount in the target currency. \n\nParameters of the function typically include: \n- `amount`: A numerical value representing the sum of money in the source currency that the user wishes to convert.\n- `source_currency`: A string identifier (such as a currency code like 'USD', 'EUR', or 'JPY') representing the currency in which the input amount is currently denominated.\n- `target_currency`: A string identifier for the currency to which the amount should be converted.\n\nThis function often relies on up-to-date exchange rate data, which may be retrieved from an external financial service or API, ensuring that the conversion reflects current market rates. It\u2019s important to handle edge cases such as:\n- Invalid currency codes, which should prompt the function to return an error or exception.\n- Zero or negative amounts, where the function might return an error or simply return zero for conversion.\n- Possible differences in decimal precision, where the function should consistently return a value rounded to an appropriate number of decimal places, typically determined by the smallest currency unit (such as cents).\n\nFor example, using this function, if a user inputs an amount of 100 in `USD` as the source currency and specifies `EUR` as the target currency, the function will calculate how much 100 USD is worth in EUR based on the latest exchange rate data.
