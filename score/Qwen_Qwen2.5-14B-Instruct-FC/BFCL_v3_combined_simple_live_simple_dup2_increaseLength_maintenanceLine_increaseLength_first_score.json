This can be done by providing the location's name, and if applicable, you should include the state in which the location is situated. When specifying the state, it is important to use the abbreviated form, such as 'CA' for California or 'NY' for New York, to ensure that the API correctly interprets the request and returns precise data.\n\nFor example, if you wish to obtain the current weather information for Los Angeles, California, you should input 'Los Angeles, CA' as the location parameter. This ensures clarity and accuracy, as multiple locations can have similar names but exist in different states or regions.\n\nThe function processes this input by communicating with the Open-Meteo API, which in turn returns the latest weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant meteorological data. This retrieval process involves making a network call to the API endpoint, sending the specified location details, and then parsing the returned data to present the current weather conditions in a user-friendly format.\n\nIn summary, this function is a reliable tool for obtaining current weather information for any given location, provided that the location and, if needed, the state are correctly specified, with states in their short form.

This retrieval process is particularly useful in scientific calculations, educational purposes, and industrial applications where understanding these thermal characteristics is crucial.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n- **substance_name**: A string parameter that specifies the name of the substance. It is important that the name provided matches the standardized nomenclature used in the database from which the thermal properties are being retrieved. Common examples include \"water,\" \"ethanol,\" or \"mercury.\"\n\n- **sea_level**: An optional numeric parameter representing the height above sea level in meters. By default, the function assumes standard atmospheric pressure at sea level (0 meters). However, variations in altitude can affect atmospheric pressure, and consequently, the boiling and melting points of substances. Providing this parameter allows for adjustments to the thermal points based on atmospheric pressure changes due to different altitudes.\n\n#### Return Values:\n\nThe function returns a tuple or a dictionary containing two key pieces of information:\n\n1. **Boiling Point**: The temperature, typically in degrees Celsius or Kelvin, at which the substance transitions from a liquid to a gas at the given sea level. This value is crucial for processes such as distillation, heating, and chemical reactions where specific thermal thresholds are important.\n\n2. **Melting Point**: The temperature at which the substance changes from a solid to a liquid state. Like the boiling point, this temperature is dependent on atmospheric pressure and thus the sea level. It is a critical parameter for processes involving phase changes, such as freezing or manufacturing materials.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n\n- If the substance name is not found in the database, the function should handle this gracefully, potentially returning a null value or raising an informative error to indicate the absence of data for the given substance.\n\n- If the sea level is not provided, the function", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"substance": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the substance."}, "sea_level": {"type": "integer", "description": "The sea level in meters."}}, "required": ["substance", "sea_level"]}}, {"name": "get_boiling_melting_points2", "description": "Retrieve the boiling point and melting point of a substance based on its name and the sea level.

This calculation is crucial in thermodynamics to understand how energy is dispersed in such a process without any loss due to irreversibility. \n\nIn an isothermal and reversible process, the change in entropy (\u0394S) is determined using the formula \u0394S = Q/T, where Q represents the heat exchanged during the process and T is the absolute temperature at which the process occurs, expressed in Kelvin.

It is important to note that this function is restricted to sending just one value at a time, ensuring that the command received is clear and unambiguous. This limitation is particularly useful when precise control is required over the appliance's operations, as it prevents any potential conflicts that could arise from sending multiple commands simultaneously.\n\n### Usage Example\n\nSuppose you are working with a smart home system where you need to adjust the temperature setting on a smart thermostat. Using this function, you can send a specific temperature value, such as 72 degrees Fahrenheit, to the thermostat. The function call would look something like this:\n\n```python\nsend_command_to_appliance(72)\n```\n\nIn this example, `72` represents the single value being sent to control the appliance.\n\n### Parameter Explanation\n\n- **value (int/float/string)**: The command value to be sent to the appliance. This parameter represents the exact instruction the appliance will receive. Depending on the appliance's capabilities, this value could be an integer, a floating-point number, or even a specific string command understood by the appliance.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- **Invalid Values**: If the value sent is not recognized by the appliance, it may result in an error or the appliance may ignore the command altogether. It is crucial to ensure that the value conforms to the expected input range or format for the appliance being controlled.\n- **Network Issues**: In scenarios where the command relies on network communication, issues such as connectivity problems or latency might affect the successful transmission of the command. It is advisable to include error-checking mechanisms to confirm the command was successfully received and executed by the appliance.\n\nOverall, the function provides a streamlined method for issuing a single, distinct command to an appliance, making it an essential tool for tasks that require direct and specific control.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["body"], "properties": {"body": {"type": "dict", "description": "A dictionary containing the parameters for the appliance command.", "properties": {"airConJobMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The current job mode of the air conditioner.", "enum": ["AIR_CLEAN", "COOL", "AIR_DRY"], "default": "COOL"}, "windStrength": {"type": "string", "description": "The strength of the air flow.", "enum": ["LOW", "HIGH", "MID"], "default": "MID"}, "monitoringEnabled": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether air quality sensor monitoring is enabled.", "default": false}, "airCleanOperationMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The operation mode for the air cleaning function.", "enum": ["START", "STOP"], "default": "STOP"}, "airConOperationMode": {"type": "string", "description": "The operation mode for the air conditioner, indicating if it is turned on or off.", "enum": ["POWER_ON", "POWER_OFF"], "default": "POWER_OFF"}, "powerSaveEnabled": {"type": "boolean", "description": "Whether power save mode is enabled to conserve energy.", "default": false}, "targetTemperature": {"type": "integer", "description": "The target temperature to set for the appliance, in degrees Celsius.", "default": 20}, "relativeHourToStop": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of hours from the current time when the appliance should stop.

It serves as a mechanism to efficiently handle multiple query classifications in a single execution, thereby streamlining the workflow for users who need to manage large datasets or multiple queries simultaneously.\n\nThe primary purpose of this function is to map each query to its corresponding intent classification based on the intent names that are passed as keyword arguments. By allowing keyword arguments, users have the flexibility to specify intent names that accurately describe the purpose or category of each query. This feature enables precise classification and organization of data, which is particularly useful in applications such as natural language processing, user interaction analysis, and automated response systems.\n\nIn practical usage, the function accepts several keyword arguments where each key corresponds to a query, and its value represents the intent name. For example, if you have a series of queries related to customer support interactions, you might use the function to assign intents like \"billing_inquiry\", \"technical_support\", or \"general_feedback\" to each query, thereby tagging them for further processing or analysis.\n\nAn edge case to consider when using this function is ensuring that the intent names provided in the keyword arguments are valid and recognized by the system. Invalid or misspelled intent names may result in misclassification or errors. Additionally, the user should handle scenarios where no intent is provided for a query, as this might require default handling or error reporting within the function.\n\nOverall, this function is a powerful tool for users who need to efficiently manage and record classifications across a wide range of queries.

Service types may vary and include options such as cleaning, ironing, and potentially other categories depending on the application's context. The unique identifier serves as a distinct reference that differentiates each service type from others within the system.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n- **serviceType (string)**: This parameter specifies the type of service for which you are seeking the unique identifier. It is essential that the input for this parameter accurately matches a valid service type within the system, such as \"cleaning\" or \"ironing\". Providing a service type that does not exist in the system will not yield a valid identifier, and may result in an error or null response.\n\n#### Return Value\n\n- **string**: The function returns a string value that represents the unique identifier of the specified service type. This identifier is used to uniquely distinguish the service type across various operations within the application, such as querying databases, logging operations, or interfacing with other system components.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\nSuppose you want to retrieve the unique identifier for the \"cleaning\" service type. You would call the function and pass the string \"cleaning\" as an argument. The function would then return a string that is the unique ID for the cleaning service. This ID can be used in subsequent operations that require a reference to the cleaning service type.\n\n```python\n# Example of retrieving the unique identifier for the cleaning service type\ncleaning_service_id = getServiceTypeId(\"cleaning\")\nprint(cleaning_service_id)  # Output might be something like \"svc-001\"\n```\n\n#### Edge Cases\n\n- **Non-existent Service Type**: If a service type is provided that does not exist within the system, the function may return an error or a null value. It is advisable to handle such cases within your code by implementing error checking or default value assignment.\n- **Case Sensitivity**: Depending on the", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["service_id"], "properties": {"service_id": {"type": "integer", "description": "The unique identifier of the service.

The calculation is based on three primary factors: the distance the vehicle travels in a year, the type of fuel used by the vehicle, and its fuel efficiency.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n1. **Distance Traveled (annual_distance):** This represents the total distance covered by the vehicle over the course of a year. It is usually measured in miles or kilometers, depending on the preferred unit system. Accurate input of this parameter is crucial as it directly influences the resulting emissions calculation.\n\n2. **Fuel Type (fuel_type):** This denotes the type of fuel the vehicle uses. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, natural gas, and electricity. Different fuels emit varying amounts of CO2 when consumed, and this parameter allows the function to use the appropriate emission factor for the calculation. \n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency (fuel_efficiency):** This is a measure of how effectively a vehicle uses fuel, typically expressed in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). Higher fuel efficiency indicates that the vehicle can travel more distance using less fuel, thus producing fewer emissions for the same distance traveled.\n\n**Calculation Process:**\n\nThe core calculation involves determining the total fuel consumption for the given distance based on the vehicle's fuel efficiency. Once the total fuel consumption is established, the function applies the specific emission factor associated with the fuel type to calculate the total CO2 emissions. The emission factor is a standard value that indicates the amount of CO2 released per unit of fuel consumed.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n- **Extreme Values for Distance:** When calculating emissions for vehicles that travel extremely high or low annual distances, ensure that the inputs remain realistic.

To achieve this, the function requires three key parameters: the airline, the passenger's name, and the ticket number. Here's a more detailed explanation of these parameters and the function's operation:\n\n- **Airline**: This parameter should be the official name or the designated airline code (such as 'AA' for American Airlines) representing the carrier operating the flight. It serves as a critical identifier, distinguishing the specific airline among various operators in the aviation industry. Accurate input is essential for retrieving the correct flight information.\n\n- **Passenger's Name**: This parameter refers to the full name of the traveler as it appears on the airline's reservation system. It acts as a secondary verification measure, ensuring that the flight status information corresponds to the correct individual and preventing any mismatches in data retrieval.\n\n- **Ticket Number**: The ticket number is a unique identifier associated with the passenger's booking. It serves as a precise reference point for the airline's database to locate the exact reservation details. The ticket number is typically a numeric string and is crucial for pinpointing the flight among numerous records.\n\nThe function, upon receiving these inputs, interacts with the airline's database or system to fetch the most recent details about the flight linked to the passenger. The current status of the flight may include information such as on-time status, delay notifications, gate information, boarding schedules, or any changes to the original itinerary.
