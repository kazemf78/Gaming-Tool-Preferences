It returns the string directly if an answer is found within it. Should the output indicate that no answer was found, an empty string is returned instead.This function is designed to systematically analyze the output generated by a language model, which is typically a sequence of text. The primary goal of this function is to determine whether a definitive answer is present within that string of text.

This empty string serves as a signal to the calling process that the language model's output did not contain any useful answer, allowing the system to handle such cases appropriately, perhaps by triggering alternative actions or notifying users of the lack of an answer.\n\nIn summary, this function acts as a filter to discern the presence or absence of answers in text output from a language model, returning the output unchanged if an answer is found, or an empty string if no answer is detected.

This predictive capability leverages a model trained on a dataset that correlates these physical attributes with the incidence of diabetes type 2, thus providing a probabilistic assessment.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `weight`: This parameter represents the individual\u2019s weight, typically measured in kilograms or pounds. It is crucial to ensure that the weight input is accurately measured and converted to the appropriate unit to maintain the integrity of the prediction.\n- `height`: The height of the individual is another critical input, usually recorded in meters or inches. Similar to weight, the height should be precisely measured and standardized to the unit expected by the function for consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Functionality:**\n- The function processes these inputs through a computational model, which likely involves statistical or machine learning algorithms trained to recognize patterns between body mass index (BMI), calculated from height and weight, and the predisposition to Type 2 diabetes.\n- The output is a probability score that indicates the likelihood of the individual developing diabetes type 2. This score is typically a value between 0 and 1, where a higher value suggests an increased risk.\n\n**Edge Cases and Considerations:**\n- Ensure that the input values for weight and height are within a reasonable range to avoid skewed predictions. Extremely low or high values may not be within the valid range that the model was trained on and could lead to inaccurate predictions.\n- Consider the unit consistency for weight and height. If the function expects metric units, then inputs should be converted accordingly if they are initially provided in imperial units.\n- The function does not account for other risk factors such as age, family history, or lifestyle, which are also significant contributors to the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.

Metrics may include sales figures, performance scores, or any other numerical data relevant to the question being asked.\n\n- **Country**: This parameter specifies the geographic location that the query should focus on. It determines the country whose data will be retrieved, ensuring that the results are relevant to the user's geographical interest.\n\n- **Date Range**: This defines the time period for which the data is relevant. It includes start and end dates, allowing the query to fetch data that falls within this specific timeframe.\n\nBy accurately identifying these parameters, the function ensures that the resulting database query is tailored to the user's specific needs and context. For example, if a user wants to find out the average income of individuals aged 25-35 in the technology sector within the United States over the last five years, the function will parse these elements to form a precise query.

Additionally, for every minute that passes, the hour hand moves 0.5 degrees (30 degrees / 60 minutes).\n   - **Minute Hand Position**: The minute hand completes a full circle, or 360 degrees, in 60 minutes. Hence, it moves 6 degrees per minute (360 degrees / 60 minutes).\n\n3. **Angle Calculation**:\n   - **Raw Angle**: The function first calculates the absolute difference between the angles of the hour and minute hands.\n   - **Minimal Angle**: Since the clock is circular, the function determines the smaller angle. This is done by taking the minimum between the raw angle and 360 degrees minus the raw angle, ensuring that the angle is always 180 degrees or less.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- **Exact hour**: If the minute is set to zero, the calculation must handle the scenario where the minute hand is at the 12 o'clock position, and the position of the hour hand is straightforwardly `hour * 30` degrees.\n- **Midnight and Noon**: These times are special cases", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"hours": {"type": "integer", "description": "The hour on the clock face."}, "minutes": {"type": "integer", "description": "The minutes on the clock face."}, "round_to": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of decimal places to round the result to, default is 2."}}, "required": ["hours", "minutes"]}}]}, "model_result_raw": [{"calculate_clock_angle2": {"hours": 18, "minutes": 30}}], "model_result_decoded": [{"calculate_clock_angle2": {"hours": 18, "minutes": 30}}], "possible_answer": [{"calculate_clock_angle1": {"hours": [6], "minutes": [30], "round_to": ["", 2]}}, {"calculate_clock_angle2": {"hours": [6], "minutes": [30], "round_to": ["", 2]}}, {"calculate_clock_angle3": {"hours": [6], "minutes": [30], "round_to": ["", 2]}}]}

Allows for the bulk recording of query classifications in one function call.This function is designed to efficiently manage and record the classification of a large number of queries by associating them with specific intent names. It achieves this by leveraging keyword arguments, where each keyword corresponds to an intent name, and the associated value is a collection of queries that share this intent. By using this approach, users can perform bulk recordings of query classifications in a single function call, significantly streamlining the process.\n\n### Parameters\n\n- **intent_name**: Keyword arguments where each keyword represents the name of an intent. This acts as a label that describes the purpose or goal of the queries associated with it.\n\n- **queries**: The values that accompany each intent name keyword argument. These are the actual queries that need to be classified. They can be provided in various iterable forms, such as lists or tuples, allowing for flexibility in input data structures.\n\n### Functionality\n\nWhen you call this function, it processes each keyword argument, taking the name of the keyword as the intent and the corresponding value as the list of queries. The function then records the association between each query and its intent, effectively classifying them in bulk. This method is particularly useful for applications that require organizing a large number of queries systematically, such as natural language processing tasks, chatbots, or automated customer service systems.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- If no queries are provided for a given intent, the function will simply record the intent with an empty list of queries, ensuring that all intents are processed but without any associated data.\n  \n- If duplicate queries are provided under the same intent, the function will still record each instance, as this might be intentional depending on the use case (e.g., tracking frequency of certain queries).\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\n# Example of how to call the function with multiple intents and their associated queries\nrecord_classifications(\n    greeting=[\"Hello\", \"Hi there\", \"Good morning\"],\n    farewell=[\"Goodbye\", \"See you later\", \"Take care\"],\n    inquiry=[\"What's the weather", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["acc_routing_start", "atm_finder_start", "faq_link_accounts_start", "get_balance_start", "get_transactions_start", "outofscope"], "properties": {"acc_routing_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries requesting the bank routing numbers or account numbers."}, "atm_finder_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for locations of ATMs, specified in the format of 'City, State (abbr)', such as 'Berkeley, CA' or 'New York, NY'."}, "faq_link_accounts_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to linking accounts within the bank's system."}, "get_balance_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries asking for account balances, available funds, or other financial balances."}, "get_transactions_start": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries related to viewing transactions, deposits, purchases, and transaction details."}, "outofscope": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "A list of queries that do not classify to any other available intents."}}}}]}, "model_result_raw": "The query \"what is the weather like\" does not fit into the intents provided in the `record1` and `record2` functions, which are related to banking and financial services.

For strings, it returns the characters in reverse order. For booleans, it returns the negation. For numbers, it returns the negative value.The function is designed to take a single input and return its reversed or inverted form, depending on the type of the input provided. When the input is a string, the function processes it by reversing the order of its characters, effectively providing the string in a backward reading manner. For example, if the string \"hello\" is passed as input, the function will return \"olleh\". This operation is particularly useful for operations that require backward iteration or when comparing mirrored text forms.\n\nIn the case of boolean inputs, the function operates by returning the logical negation of the input value. This means if the input is `True`, the function will return `False`, and if `False` is provided, it will return `True`. This aspect of the function is valuable in scenarios where a toggle switch or logical inversion is required.\n\nWhen the input is a number, the function calculates and returns its negative value. This involves changing the sign of the number from positive to negative or vice versa. For instance, if the input is `10`, the function will return `-10`; similarly, if the input is `-5`, the function will return `5`. The function thus effectively inverts the numeric value, which can be particularly useful in mathematical computations where sign inversion is necessary.\n\nOverall, the function is versatile, capable of handling different data types, and performs distinct operations based on the type of the input. It is important to ensure that the input is of a type that the function is designed to handle, as providing unsupported types could result in unexpected behavior. The function is designed to be straightforward, allowing for seamless integration into larger applications where such reverse or inversion operations are required.", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "required": ["input_value"], "properties": {"input_value": {"type": "any", "description": "The value to be reversed.

The primary goal of this function is to interact with network management systems or APIs to extract information about the nodes, which can include switches, routers, or other networking devices, that are part of a particular fabric. \n\n### Parameters\n\n- **fabric_id**: This is a crucial parameter that uniquely identifies the fabric within the network for which the node information is being requested. It ensures that the correct set of nodes associated with the specified fabric is retrieved. It is important that this parameter is accurately provided in the request to avoid errors or retrieving data from an unintended fabric.\n\n### Usage Example\n\nWhen utilizing this function, it should be integrated into a system where network fabrics are managed, such as a data center configuration management tool or network orchestration service. Below is a hypothetical example of how this function might be called:\n\n```python\n# Assuming 'network_api_client' is an instance of a client capable of making HTTP requests\nfabric_id = \"fabric-12345\"\nnodes_list = network_api_client.get_nodes_by_fabric(fabric_id)\nprint(nodes_list)\n```\n\nIn this example, the function is expected to send a GET request, typically to a RESTful API endpoint, passing the fabric identifier as part of the URL or query parameters. The response, ideally in a structured format like JSON or XML, will contain the list of nodes associated with the specified fabric, which can then be processed or displayed according to the needs of the application.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- **Invalid Fabric ID**: If an incorrect or non-existent fabric ID is provided, the function may return an error response. It is essential to handle such cases by implementing error-checking mechanisms.\n  \n- **Network Errors**: Network issues, such as timeouts or connectivity problems, may prevent the successful execution of the GET request.

This effectively opens a new command shell, executes the `dir` command, and then returns the control back to the Python script upon completion of the command.\n\nIt's important to note that `os.system()` is a simple way to execute commands but may not be suitable for all use cases, especially when capturing the command's output is necessary. In such cases, using more advanced modules like `subprocess` might be preferable.\n\nAdditionally, the function's return value is the exit status of the command executed. Typically, a return value of `0` indicates success, while any other value suggests an error occurred. This behavior aligns with the convention used in shell scripting where the command's exit status can be used for conditional logic based on the success or failure of the executed command.\n\nCare should be taken with the input command to avoid security risks, such as command injection, especially if the command string includes user-generated input.

This function is particularly useful for automating tasks that require command-line interactions or for running scripts and executable files directly from a Python program. As a usage example, to execute a single command, you might pass a string like `\"dir\"` to list directory contents. For multiple commands, you could provide a string such as `\"cd C:\\\\ && dir\"` to change directories and then list the contents.

The `os.system()` function is a straightforward way to invoke a command in the system's command line interface. It is particularly tailored for use on Windows platforms, ensuring that the command is interpreted according to Windows' command syntax. \n\nIf there is a need to execute multiple commands sequentially, users should concatenate these commands with the '&&' operator. This operator ensures that the subsequent command will only execute if the preceding command is successful, meaning it returns a zero exit status. This is a crucial feature for script automation where the success of each step depends on the successful completion of the previous one.\n\nHowever, when dealing with more complex tasks that require multiple commands or more advanced logic, it is advisable to create a batch (.bat) file. A batch file is a text file containing a series of commands intended to be executed by the command-line interpreter, which can offer greater flexibility and control compared to running commands directly through `os.system()`. By writing your logic into a .bat file, you can manage intricate script processes more efficiently, including error handling, flow control, and conditional logic, which can be cumbersome or impractical to manage using `os.system()` alone.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the function:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Single command\nos.system('dir')  # Lists directory contents in Windows\n\n# Multiple commands\nos.system('cd C:\\\\ && dir')  # Changes directory and lists contents\n\n# For complex tasks, save commands in a .bat file and execute\nos.system('path_to_your_script\\\\your_script.bat')\n```\n\nIn using `os.system()`, it is also important to note that the function returns the exit status code of the command executed, which can be used to determine if the command was executed successfully or if an error occurred.

The calculation is based on three crucial parameters: the distance traveled by the vehicle in that year, the type of fuel the vehicle uses, and the fuel efficiency of the vehicle.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n1. **Distance Traveled**: This parameter represents the total number of miles or kilometers the vehicle has traveled in a year. It is a critical factor, as greater distances typically result in higher emissions.\n\n2. **Fuel Type**: The type of fuel the vehicle uses significantly impacts the calculation. Common fuel types include gasoline, diesel, electric, and hybrid options. Each fuel type has a specific carbon emissions factor, which denotes the amount of carbon dioxide produced per unit of fuel consumed. This emissions factor is essential for accurately estimating the vehicle's carbon footprint.\n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency**: This represents how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel, usually expressed in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). Higher fuel efficiency indicates that the vehicle can travel further on a smaller amount of fuel, potentially reducing the total emissions.\n\n**Calculation Process:**\n\nThe function combines these parameters to estimate the annual carbon dioxide emissions. It considers the distance traveled and divides it by the vehicle's fuel efficiency to determine the total fuel consumed over the year. This result is then multiplied by the carbon emissions factor associated with the selected fuel type to calculate the total emissions in terms of carbon dioxide.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n- If the distance traveled is zero, the function should correctly return zero emissions, as no travel means no fuel consumption or emissions.\n- If the fuel efficiency is excessively high, it could result in minimal emissions even for significant travel distances, which should be correctly processed.\n- Different fuel types with different emissions factors must be handled accurately to reflect real-world differences in carbon output.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n\nSuppose a vehicle travels 15,000 kilometers in", "parameters": {"type": "dict", "properties": {"distance": {"type": "integer", "description": "The distance travelled in miles."}, "fuel_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of fuel used by the vehicle."}, "fuel_efficiency": {"type": "float", "description": "The vehicle's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon."}, "efficiency_reduction": {"type": "integer", "description": "The percentage decrease in fuel efficiency per year (optional).
